"
1164,"Nepal's nationalism was not insulted by the Shamisar , who did not worship the Creator of the Nepalese Empire in the Parliament House to bring a picture of hunting .
"
1165,"In order to take formal responsibility only, the Royal Government has said that the government has convinced that the government is not compromised and it is not right to respond to justified demands.

"
1175,"Those who review the current political activities are claiming that the unity government of Nepali Congress has reached the minds of rejecting the need for consensus, even in the frenzy of victory.
"
1176,"In the democratic countries, ego role is imposed in opposition parties and in the solution of each national problem, policy is taken according to the necessary advice from opposition parties.

2613,"That is why it is a matter of happiness, and on this occasion the country is happy.
"
2614,"Due to this, according to Nepal's national interests, India has the history of the past that India has already touched.

"
2633,"Butwal thread factory : positive accessory
"
2634,"Whatever the crisis is, even in the development of industries in Nepal, the capitalists have started to pay attention.
"
2635,"If possible, if everything is needed to be produced in Nepal, then nothing else can be a thing like that.
"
2636,"If this happens, our country is not obliged to depend on other countries, but on the other hand, Nepali people do not have to face unemployment problems.
"
2637,"But requirement - government support.
"
2638,"The government should provide protection to any item that can be produced in our country and also help to provide its market.
"
2639,"A large threaded factory has been installed in Butwal and has also started producing successfully.
"
2640,"There is no need for a thread and it is not less happiness in Nepal than its production.
"
2641,"If this can happen, if one gets an opportunity to raise the industry, on the other hand, the capitalists are also encouraged to establish a new industry.
"
2642,"Of course, Butwal Spinning Mill, starting with Mr. 5 to the Government and the Government of the Union, Mr. - who have sasthanale.
"
2643,"But until the private sector was admitted , the factory could not achieve success.
"
2644,"Also, the Salt Trading Company was added.
"
2645,"And in view of the first unsatisfactory work, the responsibility of the operation was handed over to Salt Trading Ltd in 044 years.
"
2646,"Many government-level factories are drowned.
"
2647,"They are all victims of corruption.
"
2648,"If the private sector including Mohan Gopal Khanaan was not included in the woven thread industry, its condition would not be different.
"
2649,"From this, it should be clear that the government should give the private sector the responsibility of the industry.
"
2650,"Yes , the government should bear the responsibility of encouraging them and conserving them.
"
2651,"India's unbelief has not been removed
"
2652,"There is an illustration in Nepal, which is known as Agulta, the dog of the dog, lightning the lightning.
"
2653,"We have remembered that parable when Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala visited India.
"
2654,"The Government of India is encouraged by various sectarian struggles used from different census within the country.
"
2655,"And this kind of doubt is also of the Nepali community.
"
2656,"In the country , there was an independent Panchayat system in Nepal, nationalism in Nepal was linked to the interests of a family, not with the public.
"
2657,"But today, that situation is not the rule of a certain nationalist family in the disputed country.
"
2658,"Today there is democracy in Nepal and the democracy that has been evident from India has come in Nepal.
"
2659,"The business is unable to match
"
2660,"We also like to be rich and skilled businessmen like people of the world.
"
2661,"But are we waiting for that ?
"
2662,"Nepal - India relations have improved, our error occurred that day, but the reality has proved to be too much impact on the even days of our error occurred?
"
2663,"These things are also linked to our progress and development.
"
2664,"To develop and develop, the country's population must be self-sustainable.
"
2665,"Business skills and integrity require citizens in the country.
"
2666,"Only then there will be progress in the country.
"
2667,"Without economic development, man's life does not improve but it is necessary for the economy to build economies.
"
2668,"In order to build economies, from government to civil and citizens, even from workman to capitalist, a need for a business is needed.
"
2669,"Requires honesty
"
2670,"Needs Efficiency.
"
2671,"Nothing of these things has been found in our country.
"
2672,"In the same way, due to our weaknesses, people of other countries in our country will soon succeed to play well on our heads.
"
2673,"We have not even acquired information about capitalist economies.
"
2674,"There are several commission agents in our country , there are many suppliers and businessmen who have been more dependent on fraudulent behavior.
"
2675,"The confidence of the Payment and Supply Watch has not yet been completed in the society.
"
2676,"Here too, it is also dangerous to pay and the borrowing process is very daunting.
"
2677,"Because mutual behavior between the parties is based on the spirit of business.
"
2678,"Although the capitalist system is fraud, the prosperity within capitalism is also a devotion to the honest element.
"
2679,"The betrayal element can not make a decisive role in it.
"
2680,"But our country is not only in government bodies but corruption in every aspect of life.
"
2681,"You must do an unlawful or invisible payment to please the agents of the supplier or supplier.
"
2682,"By paying only the truck owner you must pay a separate truck driver to not get into the drive.
"
2683,"This is our curse curse.

"

"

"
2712,"Although it is lawful for the relationship to be dependent on the dependence, the behavior is the compulsion of dependence on the Indian currency, by the behavior.
"
2713,"This compulsion is the pain of Nepalese history.
"
2714,"This pain has not been resolved and this revival showed that it is true.
"
2715,"This means that the status of Nepalese currency will be circulated by the determining the policy of the Reserve Bank of India.
"
2716,"If the Reserve Bank of India decline the currency of Indian currency, then the revenues of Nepalese currency will be reversed and it will be priced if there is no revenues.
"
2717,"Should it be free from the situation or not ?
"
2718,"If so, how ?
"
2719,"And why not ?
"
2720,"The Government of Sri 5 with the Indian currency of Nepalese currency 1 . As a result of revival of 7 percent, the market was hit.
"
2721,"Items worth Rs 168 per kg in India have now been purchased at 165.
"
2722,"Due to this, even though Nepalese rupees have less investment in imported goods from India, instead of reducing the cost of all goods in the market has increased.
"
2723,"Government institutions have increased the value of information from radio to radio.
"
2724,"According to the notice of the National Trading, the Nepalese rupee depreciation on the basis of convertible currency has increased the reim of Rs 22 for the value of the new print.
"
2725,"Following the logic of government bodies, private sector has also increased the value.
"
2726,"This means that the Government of Sri Lanka has been depreciated by depreciation of money.
"
2727,"In the recent election, what will be the achievement if the government is formed by gaining a lesser majority of this market ?
"
2728,"Would it help Nepali Congress to get a majority of the local elections now ?
"
2729,"The international currency fund has been pressured by the International Monetary Fund to reduce depreciation of Indian currency, and this is the value of India to get Arravo loan from that fund.
"
2730,"If this is not what it costs, then if it is not ?
"
2731,"Nepal could not develop yak

2732,"In Soviet Russia since 1930, there have been ongoing efforts to develop Yak ( Chunai cow ) .
"
2733,"There are various tests for its development in India and French scientists in Nepal have been searching for research and research.
"
2734,"There were similar efforts in China too.
"
2735,"According to Mr. Li Kungiang of China's animal development exploration, Yak has been found very helpful in Chinese scientists, born by wild yak and Palatak yak.
"
2736,"This yacht is more than woolen 11 . 2% more and milk 19 . Returns 7 percent more.
"
2737,"Yak is a Chinese animal found in the south - west region.
"
2738,"This is used in the deed.
"
2739,"Duration of the work, wrote to her, milk, and other work is to be used.
"
2740,"Due to its unique power, it is used to transport goods in an unlikely place.
"
2741,"The modern center of its development has been established in the hilly region of Tibet.

2742,"According to an estimate, China has 100 million yak.
"
2743,"It is 85 percent of the world's yak.
"
2744,"Mr. Lee Kingangi said that Yak seems to be used in China since 10 years.
"
2745,"This can easily transport goods to the high peak of Himalayas.
"
2746,"The wild yak weighs a kilogram of 1000 kg, and the home of Ptt Yak is weighed up to 3 kg.
"
2747,"The difference between the house and the road
"
2748,"The political parties are now being a parliamentarian when they are worried when they get up and wake up to break it.
"
2749,"Nepal has now moved on the path of liberation through its thinking and meditation.
"
2750,"It can not be imagined that this initiative of workers can lead to failure.
"
2751,"However, it should not be done to fill it with pre-perception and to dump water.
"
2752,"The interpretation of Nepal's liberation has already been explained.
"
2753,"Self. B. P. Koirala bhanaianusara morning - the drop in hand - home connectivity, access to milk cows by little, his son and daughter are teaching more.
"
2754,"If this facility is accessible to every axis in Nepal, if Nepal is liberated then it will be.
"
2755,"Political activists who are members of this assembly should be worried.
"
2756,"But there are some differences between worrying and worries in trying to tear the political party.
"
2757,"If the first worry expression is in Parliament, the last worry is on the street.
"
2758,"In the last show, the participants leap on the road , and the expression of greatness , prosperity and intellectual thoughts in the first show is presented in the House.
"
2759,"So there is a difference between the idea of ​​blowing down the road and in Parliament.
"
2760,"MPs should consider this difference. The representative rules guide this difference.
"
2761,"Therefore , these workers of non-compliance have come to the shoulders.
"
2762,"Public complaints are being raised in Parliament.
"
2763,"Speeches are made on the road.
"
2764,"House is argued.
"
2765,"The voice of another is conveyed by voice by shouting on the road.
"
2766,"Speaking in the House to create his voice echoes from the streets drinking, and given that - as far as care is taken that ubheka audience sunosa his voice.
"
2767,"The "" back ventures "" of the ruling and opposition of these differences of political endeavors will not bring anything to the end.
"
2768,"The previous rows of the ego to express this difference to them should be borne.
"
2769,"Russia - America's largest weapons vendor
"
2770,"According to the article, from 1984 to 1990, the US had sold 54 billion dollars to 77 countries.
"
2771,"Similarly, Russia has 38 countries . $ 8 billion was sold.
"
2772,"From the time of 1985 to 1989, Russia had earned more money from Russia than weapons trade.
"
2773,"But, in 1990, the United States moved to Russia and 8 in that year . $ 7 billion was worth selling weapons.
"
2774,"This sale is 30% of the world's arms sales and it has reached Russia.
"
2775,"Its trolley kettle has contracted a $ 9.5 million weapon.
"
2776,"This post-Gulf war seems to be US $ 3 billion more than the US sales Russia.
"
2777,"According to the plan of the US government, a total of 33 billion dollars will be sold in the current year.
"
2778,"It is a two - thirds of the world's sales .
"
2779,"The Bush administration has emphasized Saudi Arabia and Egypt as soon as possible.
"
2780,"Formation of national assembly
"
2781,"Today, the representative of the representative assembly will begin.
"
2782,"This meeting today will open the way to the selection of members for the formation of the Honorable and National Assembly.
"
2783,"The UML has expressed opinion that the cabinet should adopt the consensus of the opposition parties to prepare the names of members of the nominated members of Mr. 5 Wat.
"
2784,"The idea of ​​how much this idea has received today will be cleared today.
"
2785,"The name that is being shifted to the National Assembly on India is the tradition that is prepared by the consent of both sides.
"
2786,"Instead of rejecting it, the ruling will be a political understanding.
"
2787,"This is the tradition in India.
"
2788,"Whereas the ruling party members of the anti-party members know that the party members of the party members are kept open.
"
2789,"Therefore, it is not difficult to balance the fact that the immortal person is more capable and worth more than Amuk.
"
2790,"Such open situation is not in Nepal.
"
2791,"So the name of the Constituent Assembly can not be viewed as another, and it is compulsory to accept the proposal of UML.
"
2792,"According to the tradition of the Nepali Congress, the Nepali Congress can hesitate to accept this compulsion as a democratic.
"
2793,"Therefore, from UML, it should be given to the tradition of tradition to appreciate the views of the opposing parties by the ruling party by increasing the generosity of it.
"
2794,"This reconciliation in the formation of the National Assembly will ensure public confidence in the future of Parliament.
"
2795,"Unique politics from elections in India
"
2796,"They had expressed the idea that they should form a government together with Congress ( E ) .
"
2797,"Similarly, Mr. Jyoti Vasu also expressed his views on the Marxist Communist Party.
"
2798,"The major opposition party, Bharatiya Janata Party leader said Mr edavanile parties according to the election this time coming - his government had formed a promotion.
"
2799,"Therefore , the election was not publicly that Congress ( E ) should not make the government.
"
2800,"The present-day election has been convinced by all the parties.
"
2801,"So they are not in favor of holding another election immediately.
"
2802,"So they are not the other option except to give Congress ( E ) the formation of the Cabinet.
"
2803,"Soviet Union's failed disadvantage
"
2804,"Today, on the three-day day, President Gorvachev has returned to Moscow from the city of Shyamassar, and has taken control of the nation completely.
"
2805,"President Boris Yultsin of the Russian republic called on the public to support the open democratic policy of Gorvachev, against the opponents of opposition.
"
2806,"But they did not know where they met.
"
2807,"Thus, the misconduct of Mr. Gravavich's regime has failed.
"
2808,"President Gravyachh has made everyone sure by giving a message in public name.
"
2809,"We believe Mr Gravachachh will continue to keep himself firm on this path.
"
2810,"What is the day of voting ?
"
2811,"The above mentioned sources work in the field of journalism and every politician understands.
"
2812,"No one understands politics as well , journalism does not happen.
"
2813,"This source tells that the dogs like dogs to oppose the party, opposing the party, and opposing the party, is like a dog dog.
"
2814,"Everyone is able to understand what the Maoist word is anti-party.
"
2815,"However , it is difficult to think that the parties are opposed to the opponents of the party and it is difficult to believe if it is not shown.
"
2816,"In the discussion of terrorism
"
2817,"Something more intolerant in the political competition in election was seen and worse happened.
"
2818,"The blasphemy also came from all sides.
"
2819,"Today, the results of the Great Great Britain are coming out and waiting for the new government ; People are preparing for tomorrow.
"
2820,"Everybody has imagined his future as his own.
"
2821,"However , terrorism is such a promise that can not cover the palm tree as seasonal rain.
"
2822,"If the administration is active , it is difficult to think that the society and the country, it is difficult to create a foundation in such a way.
"
2823,"In Nepal, a year's administration, which was Prime Minister Mr. Bhattarai, was a good sage for terrorism.
"
2824,"There is no one here, two different massacres and robbery cases kept political colors and took the body away from the city as Gandhism and Kuala Lumpur.
"
2825,"In the massacre, the government did not raise the burden , the robbery and the robbery , did not count on the issue. Terrorism slowly started its foundation.
"
2826,"Those who walked with political interest, did not understand that the elements of the country's civil war and the intricate nature of the society did not understand.
"
2827,"There was no time to understand, neither the leaders who understood.
"
2828,"Thus, the situation went well for terrorism and it was also a test of new soil that climbed its foundation.
"
2829,"The environment was created by dragging the girls from the neck to the neck , not allowing the other to speak, and to stand in the public place.
"
2830,"Health status
"
2831,"So propaganda is one thing and reality is another thing.
"
2832,"There is no better calanasamma using data , even beyond the data integrity is not sankalanamai.
"
2833,"This time only thousands of people are dead, but more than that person has died.
"
2834,"In a situation where the government is planning a health program and plan, how should it be useful for the public or public ?
"
2835,"Otherwise it would be as if it poured much on the sand and sliced ​​it.
"
2836,"Once in Panchayat, it has been such a time, so it should be a special checkpoint that should not be done here again.
"
2837,"Therefore, in this field all studies , reorganizations and difficulties should be done.
"
2838,"Is Panch's moral code ?
"
2839,"Even when the Congressmen have begun to call themselves panchayat, the politics of the country and the administration has reached a ridiculous situation.
"
2840,"It is a surprise that the panchayat's panchayat could not show a step in which he had spoiled any of the areas in which he was scattered.
"
2841,"Did it also mean that the Panchayas conspiracy or the retroductory element ?
"
2842,"Are Panchayati conspirators made ?
"
2843,"Nepal's defense armor is breaking down
"
2844,"Nationwide movement of civil servants working in Nepal has influenced and influenced people more than a decade ago.
"
2845,"The greater number of feuds and exhibitions in the corner of the country, the agility and engagement of people in the historically known people's movement has increased.
"
2846,"The Congress, which has been attached to Ganeshman Singh from Madan Bhandari in this movement, has killed the efficacy of the leadership of Left United Front.
"
2847,"The decision to join the government's favor was a political sign, which was said to have been shaken by the government.
"
2848,"But that signal did not mark any achievements.
"
2849,"Nepal's independence administration is a proud institution that has grown up in its autonomy tradition.
"
2850,"Nepal never had to live under any foreign masters and servants.
"
2851,"Local election and leadership
"
2852,"Nepali people to practice democracy , the experience is not that being.
"
2853,"Since 2007, since the process of democracy has been constantly practiced in practice, it will be inappropriate to say that people of Nepal are ignorant of the same process.
"
2854,"Although the multi-polio system ended the incident on August 1, 2017, other democratic exercises came into the country.
"
2855,"The method of election was kept on a regular basis.
"
2856,"In the form of democracy, local self-governing bodies were elected by the public and after a 30-year exercise, multi-party system has been restored in the country.
"
2857,"The government and the leaders, who have not heard Panchayat's word, said that the bell bells in the ears, like not listening to it.
"
2858,"Whatever the name of Panchayat is given, there is a question of dead bodies of local self-governing and its work practices especially for rural people.
"
2859,"The urban area has been implanted in the absence of local leadership of responsible public representatives.
"
2860,"Is not it possible for the state and local respiratory bodies to have the co-existence of it ?
"
2861,"Or is it that the nominated leaders of party party and the local leaders elected by the public could be more democratic and publicly involved ?
"
2862,"Government has failed to negotiate.
"
2863,"End of war and new world relationship
"
2864,"Imperialist Charity in Russia has not only collapsed; the military tragedy of the second largest power of the world has also ended.
"
2865,"After the world's fierce great war, the cold war of the war is now over.
"
2866,"America has led the leadership of the industrialized nations of the West, and it seems that the independence of its nation and the freedom between nations outside of their country has become the basis of the state's sovereignty.
"
2867,"The Soviet Union in the process of demolition today has not been able to become a nation.
"
2868,"As such, the Soviet Union has accepted the sovereignty of those states.
"
2869,"The rise and fall of the Soviet Union in human history will be educated as a political philosophy.
"
2870,"In addition to other regional stresses in the world, the disruption of the Soviet Union in our South Asia's regional tensions will surely bring a qualitative shift.
"
2871,"Military disintegration Being an authoritative for India is an immediate result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
"
2872,"Leaders of unbelievers, will also be stunned for history.
"
2873,"It was understood by the creation of ' New Nepal '
"
2874,"Girija government and administration of 47 civil servants, twelve ' fit ' with efforts has started.
"
2875,"Q . I . According to the nichichka sutra, it is believed that 56 people have been decided to pass in the second spot.
"
2876,"The pioneer's order has been successful in the civil servants and now banks and other institutions have begun to move.
"
2877,"People should work after they eat food from the royalty.
"
2878,"Those who are liable to their obligation - such employees must be punished.
"
2879,"That is why political terror is not strong enough in the name of cleaning the administration.
"
2880,"The employee is merely a government policy , a means of enforcement , or a helper , not a politician.
"
2881,"Therefore, a democracy and a healthy tradition should be laid for both penalties or awards.
"
2882,"The government did not take the confidence of the government to spread terror and keep the employees on the edge of the sword.
"
2883,"No advisor advisers did not give such advice.
"
2884,"The government did not believe that self-intimidated staff can work properly and can serve the public.
"
2885,"By determining a policy and taking the staff into confidence, the government can succeed in its work.
"
2886,"Because any party's government and the administration of the country are stone and clay.
"
2887,"A combination of these two can stand at home.
"
2888,"Nepalese Congress, which is at least the ' Neo Nepal ', is going to be able to understand this technique of vision building visionary movements.
"
2889,"Where did you see the English Sheep ?
"
2890,"Deployment in the country changed , the public leaders came to Parliament , the leaders of the road came to power.
"
2891,"Now the people said Paula Issues , congress sheep seem to mean so much more people Issues - more are being speechless.
"
2892,"The change was changed , the change changed , the policy changed.
"
2893,"The 32-year-old Panchayat - not to say why the people of the universal power have given power to their leader, so they are responsible leaders.
"
2894,"There is a Congress government in the country.
"
2895,"The main antagonist is the Shakti Janata Party, like Amalena and its shadow government.
"
2896,"Both parties announced their much as - paper and lectures, the most important raids.
"
2897,"But most powerful, this Congress rule has not risen up in any sense than Panchayat.
"
2898,"Apart from increasing, the Government is unsuccessful to keep steady on the go.
"
2899,"Congress raid donor has been helpful to stir up and shout.
"
2900,"There is not only the problem of just like Biratnagar but 'the government is currently forced to buy rice from India's Jogbani and distribute it to Toyota.
"
2901,"Where did we save the democracy, except for our success, the British Sheep ?
"
2902,"The administration is still unstable.
"
2903,"The country is becoming more and more Indians and India is struggling.
"
2904,"Whatever the Bharat Sausha treats and whateversoever it is given, the UML seems convinced for the Congress.
"
2905,"Is it the fact that the tongue is stuck in a tongue lock ?
"
2906,"According to this belief, the nationalistity is seen in the Nepali Congress - is it what it means ?
"
2907,"Whatever ! People are still not bothered.
"
2908,"People hoping to relieve relief , illness , and other illicit statements on unemployment.
"
2909,"The Congress may believe it is a belief that the movement of movement and democracy can always be heard by the people of Congress.
"
2910,"So Nepali Congress had to provide relief to the people giving the clear majority to the people who took power from the streets.
"
2911,"Complete strangers bhaktibhanda sarvabhaumasakti public devotion that again - again to reach power and can not stand.
"
2912,"At least central leaders had to look and find their party well - where was the British Sheep Where ?
"
2913,"And success ?
"
2914,"Now the government's fire test
"
2915,"Nepal and India have now reached a very serious point of view of trade and trade relations.
"
2916,"Although there is also a program for the Water Resources Secretary to go to this team and also decide on the basis of water conservation on the two-party bilateral agreements.
"
2917,"More interest in India is now under water than in trade transit.
"
2918,"Perhaps therefore, with the business and trade to wipe the water resources into trade and transportation by placing the government and transportation, India has been giving more importance to water resources.
"
2919,"Possible workforce in the ongoing Parliament of Parliament for 2 months has been raised.
"
2920,"There is no serious discussion about the problem and relationship between the national heritage and Nepal and India.
"
2921,"It is welcome to stop revenue leakage and corruption
"
2922,"Even during Panchayat's carpet regime, such commissions , groups, etc. were not formed, but no one could understand it.
"
2923,"That only became the only way to eat the hoody.
"
2924,"Similarly, the interim government also formed the Malaky Commission, and that commission had also heard the alleged report presented to the Prime Minister.
"
2925,"But in fact, the report of that commission was not justified for the public.
"
2926,"Now maybe that story is like a story.
"
2927,"The government does not speak about it nor the opposition wants to be removed.
"
2928,"It is only to say what we did not understand.
"
2929,"At the same time, the claim was also opened to open the right price shop in the area.
"
2930,"As the people searched for silk , they could not even find a search shop on the day to give the official shop a day , and that lamp did not fit.
"
2931,"Reverse Mansuli Chamal Rs . Till 16 by force, Khan was compelled to sit by hanging his face.
"
2932,"About the group formed recently.
"
2933,"And only people can be able to get relief in true meaning.
"
2934,"Do not worry if Jati came to Jogi ...?
"
2935,"Does the nation have Brahmanism ?
"
2936,"After success of the people's movement, after expressing the motive to deliver the responsibility of the Prime Minister from Shri 5 to Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in his place.
"
2937,"That too was a great sacrifice.
"
2938,"On the days afterwards, serial speeches started walking smoothly.
"
2939,"The common people were taking it a little bit.
"
2940,"However, regardless of the love and sacrifice of the nation there, the people did not want to comment on the tallest memories by remembering these minorities.
"
2941,"Last saptahabhitra the earthquake came suddenly, and the black cloud rising in the sense of democracy found , he gave the whole nation tulyai troubled.
"
2942,"Seeing Brahmanabad in the cabinet, 3. There are no more than 4 brands.
"
2943,"And not just the Brahmins in the government, but all the races are represented.
"
2944,"The drama of the Nepali Congress that has fallen in the past has ended.
"
2945,"Party leaders have power sharing.
"
2946,"This has also reduced the likelihood of becoming more vulnerable in the future.
"
2947,"The great hope of Nepali people
"
2948,"Democracy has been rehabilitated in the country by shielding a 30-year-old Nirankash Panchayati system.
"
2949,"After the establishment of democracy, the wishes and expectations of Nepali people have also been incomplete.
"
2950,"But the economic situation of the country has reached a dramatically.
"
2951,"The government has made Nepali Congress and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has been formed.
"
2952,"The House was also well and the church should be in the state to do something for the people.
"
2953,"But, looking at the tendency of past days, the Girija government seems to have been able to surrender its clever and lip-neutral selfish volunteers and advisers from Singhwarwar.
"
2954,"The news of Lipiput consultants of his Singerwar has been able to come to light in the news of modern video and the tune of making Billdong in Kathmandu.
"
2955,"The fact that the top level leaders of the party, for the posts of the ambassadors , GMs and secretary , also reached the publication of the Supreme Court's episode.
"
2956,"The faces of all the ministers of the Girija government are gradually getting nervous before the people.
"
2957,"There is another big charge on the government of Analala.

2961,"And there will be the Nepalese people in the best remembrance of hope in the upcoming days.
"
2962,"While discussing Nepal's relations with Nepal, there are many points that the Congressis take a breath of satisfaction, but also the other people who do not forget the view of Nepali nationalism.
"
2963,"In the past, India raised its relationship with Nepal in the past, raising questions like why about 5 million umbrella coming from China in the country that has two million people.
"
2964,"In fact, India is the biggest exploitor of Nepal, even if the Nepalese people dare power by drowning the dust of India.
"
2965,"There is also a new agreement that Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has concluded in the background that India recognizes Nepalese friendship in making its singular market.
"

"
2976,"This question is yet to be discussed in the capital.
"
2977,"Nepali and Nepalese people had started protesting against the unnecessary financial burden of tolerance of Nepal and India's relations and the Panchayati system had fallen.
"
2978,"However, in the Panchayati system, the multi-party system has not been able to feel different.
"
2979,"Therefore, the patient of the distributors of Indian intelligence, by becoming increasingly and serious, should study the government and have the highest study of each of their activities.
"
2980,"Otherwise, multi-party system is also threatened.

2982,"It is a pleasure to eat some killers of the mass movement.
"
2983,"However, keeping the dead killers of the people's movement alive from Balakotar's garbage, wearing themselves in the wings of true Congress, searching for maintaining the oldest step by stirring up the issue.
"
2984,"What is the secret of removing drowsiness in Hirayalal Regmijas like chief commanders of the People's Movement ?
"
2985,"The people want to take action against the killers of the people's movement by plotting grievance from the posts and the people have been formed since the date of formation of interim government.
"
2986,"But there is some salt, the staff there are those Dhong , which is easy , gossips - flatter all.
"
2987,"Should there be no other environment in the meantime when people start daily promotion in the daily chakrabis ?
"
2988,"Before seeing the Congress before the people's movement, giving preference to the corrupt people and the promotion of corrupt people like boobs, is not the subject of curiosity for the public and tomorrow's public.

"
2992,"After the elected government has taken various positive measures to fulfill the expectations and expectations of the people after taking over the duties, various political and economic challenges are facing.
"
2993,"A half-month long strike of civil servants and complications have led to complex problems.
"
2994,"In this situation, the efforts of the workers and government workers in a sensible atmosphere between employees and employees will end in the highest interest of the nation.
"
2995,"The need for further effort is to reach the point of view between all the political parties, not to be positioned in a timely manner, in keeping with the welfare of the nation.
"
2996,"Soviet Union change
"
2997,"In addition, the Cold War has ended due to improvement in relations between the US and the top negotiation.
"
2998,"Under the leadership of Gorbachov, the fundamental political change in the Soviet Union has strengthened the establishment of Stalinist residues.
"
2999,"If the process of democratization in the Soviet Union had gradually progressed, perhaps it would not have come to be so soon that Gerbobov was incomplete.
"
3000,"The new leadership of the country, mutilated - ravaged economy and to prevent such a decisive step in to save the sobhiyatasanghako disintegration and civil war had made it clear that up.
"
3001,"The two major countries of Asia, as well as the United Nations General Secretariat, are expected to have a clear official view of this, in the context of which India and China have considered the internal situation in the internal situation.
"
3002,"Concrete program required
"
3003,"There has been a couple of years ago to control the trafficking of physical business and chelyabits , however , there has been no significant improvement in the work.
"
3004,"In order to operate hard work and control of women's business operations in a war zone, it is essential to take concrete steps to end its basic causes.
"
3005,"In a situation where more than one million women are forced to enter into foreign trade in their neighbors, they should be tried from affiliate bodies to save them.

3008,"It will be appropriate to evaluate the decision-making of all conflict-free programs by the Employee Organization as a Victor's victory rather than defeat anyone.
"
3009,"Even though the demands of the employees were legitimate and fair, the government was not possible to fulfill those demands regarding the desperate economic conditions of the country.
"
3010,"Why do not any aspect of staff , come - his interest and should not be politicized svarthasiddhinimti.
"
3011,"The interest of the population
"
3012,"The National Population Committee was formed in Nepal under the chairmanship of President of the National Planning Commission, Girija Prasad Koirala.
"
3013,"Welcome decision
"
3014,"Soviet leader Mikhail Gorvichov has announced to destroy all short-term missiles and stop molecular tests for one year.
"
3015,"World leaders including the United States of America , Velayat , North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have welcomed the proposed proposal for extensive disarming .
"
3016,"In the backwardness of the said initiative of President Bush, the representation in the field of disasters was expected in a way similar to the Soviet Union.
"
3017,"In this regard, he ' Glasnost ' and ' Perestroika ' , such as using his remarkable ideas Soviet politics has come.
"
3018,"On the other hand, the rise of Gravavobov in Soviet politics is an indication of the eternal faith that human consciousness can not be steadfast forever.
"
3019,"Thus, the Soviet leadership, which showed the direction of nuclear weapons in the direction of deduction, would not be able to continue this universal truth.
"
3020,"Housing system
"
3021,"The root of housing unemployment is the economic disadvantage.
"
3022,"Unless economic disturbance and drought can be eradicated in the nation, efforts to find a settlement of settlement are only to be served only by day-by-day.
"
3023,"In the economic development and prosperity, homelessness does not have to be such a big problem.
"
3024,"In order to properly operate the people in the path of national development, the government seems to be seriously involved in fulfilling their basic needs like housing.
"
3025,"Because due to the fulfillment of these requirements, the confidence and belief of the government in the public, as well as the overall national advancement, increases public interest in progress.
"
3026,"In this context , by expressing the clearance of the policies of the present government, to give priority to the problems of the ' first priority ', the Minister has raised the new hope of a new hope in the housingless community.
"
3027,"It seems to be reviewed on the rehabilitation policy and program towards permanently solving the problems of habitat.
"
3028,"It should be the main objective of housing settlers to get housing facilities , otherwise otherwise.
"
3029,"Flood disorder
"
3030,"Deadly marine storm and floods, which killed more than one thousand people in Bangladesh, have been displaced due to lack of homelessness in Bangladesh.
"
3031,"Many floods and natural disasters have been taking huge breakthrough in the development of Bangladesh annually flood annihilation , famine , hunger , hazard etc.
"
3032,"Natural and divine disasters have not only been able to survive only Bangladesh but other South Asian nations.
"
3033,"Despite the development of predictable technology about natural disasters, appropriate and reliable technologies have not been developed to combat natural disasters.
"
3034,"Due to this, sea storm , floods , earthquake , garbage or earthquake have caused extensive damage to wealth.
"
3035,"In recent years, environmental destruction in various countries of Asia has been raising.
"
3036,"Thousands of thousands of people have been inappropriate in terms of agriculture, as thousands of people die from the disorders caused by the environmental destruction every year in Bangladesh.
"
3037,"It will be relevant to remember the fact that the sea flood in Bangladesh in 1988 killed more than one thousand people.
"
3038,"Nepal can not live without geographical reason with the natural destruction of Bangladesh and India.
"
3039,"Many rivers flow from Nepal also affect the geographical and natural structure of the country.
"
3040,"If the environment of the Himalayas is not balanced, it also affects India , Bangladesh and Bhutan.
"
3041,"In 1970, there was more than a million people dead in the sea and the flood that flooded in Bangladesh.
"
3042,"Only in the past three decades, in India, only natural disasters have died as humans.
"
3043,"Every year, floods and floods have been killed by dozens of people in Nepal.
"
3044,"Natural disadvantage of human being created by a serious mistake is why people become destroyed because of destruction.
"
3045,"Therefore, before facing the natural and divine disaster, it is wise to learn lessons from such tragedies at times.
"
3046,"Question of Agricultural Development
"
3047,"Nepal is full of village-based villages, basically the country is living as a cultural nation.
"
3048,"Our reality of dependence in agriculture sector is more than ninety percent population has become the most important part of agriculture sector.
"
3049,"In our context, the national economy can not be strengthened and strengthened till the extent that the agriculture sector is not able to spread it properly.
"
3050,"Of course, as per the basis of these things, all the periodic schemes of Nepal have been given special priority to the development of agriculture sector.
"
3051,"Thus, the agriculture sector has not been able to move ahead even if the priority is given to agriculture sector on the development policy and programs of the nation.
"
3052,"Even today, the situation of Nepali farmers is really trivial.
"
3053,"Eating two chest and taking a pen, it has always been a problem for them.
"
3054,"Therefore, in such a kind of background, today the change in the context of today's policy and programs coming from the national level is expected to be re-evaluated.
"
3055,"Not only that, due to the lack of food grains, the actual production of the farmer has not been able to benefit from the increase in its value.
"
3056,"Consequently, consumers have died on the one hand, disappointment has arisen in the farming farmers on the other side.
"
3057,"Therefore national interest adversity seems to be a desirable way to end this horrific situation as soon as possible.
"
3058,"It is always the case that problems of problems like our farmers are annually at times , when there are no sesame , water scarcity.
"
3059,"In addition, the lack of advanced visa and modern technology has always been the subject of the erosion in our agriculture sector.
"
3060,"Such problems have to be reconsidered on our own perceptions that have been dependent on external sector for our agriculture.
"
3061,"Alternative remedies of the rotation
"
3062,"The results of mischievous pastures , errors, and misconceptions are being consumed today.
"
3063,"Facing the foundation of the bridges made only 23 years ago, not to say anything about it.
"
3064,"The future goal is not to be achieved by eliminating the past or negative aspects of the past.
"
3065,"It is wise to look at the positive side of what can be done in the interests of the common people.
"
3066,"If it should not be taken into consideration , the bridge for construction in 15 days will be fixed.
"
3067,"It will be a type of divergence bridge.
"
3068,"Many of these are things , which are focused on the damage that are not blocked from carrying out even.
"
3069,"Since the deposits of excess deposits are more than the increase in the shell, the openings have been deepening and the foundations of the bridge have been weakening.
"
3070,"Due to lack of bridges from improper benefits in the places of the city, even the situation of valley bridges has become desperate.
"
3071,"The current government is familiar with the fact that the solution of the polio can not be caught only after the problem is encountered.
"
3072,"Therefore, the inspection and control of the process will also be initiated in the new construction along with the damage of the losses caused by the past mistakes .
"
3073,"On the one hand, there is a possibility that the government will not be ready to prepare bridges of Bhagkebigra bridges and restore the commodity and to make more publication for the future in the future.
"
3074,"Needs a clear direction
"
3075,"The problem of drug abuse today has spread many nations around the world.
"
3076,"Even though Nepal has not yet become so serious this problem, there are substantial signs of serious signs that can be serious in the future.
"
3077,"However, depending on the figures kept from the government's estimates, this problem has been increasing every year, respectively.
"
3078,"Based on the experiences of related official areas, Nepal seems to have become familiar with the world as a ' transit ' point in the activities of the illegally enforced substances in the current context .
"
3079,"It is a sad thing to happen to ourselves, and through this, it can not be said that this problem does not hurt the Nepali society of tomorrow very seriously.
"
3080,"But also showing the political functionality and solidarity in the direction of conducting such principle of commitment in practice also becomes equally desirable.
"
3081,"Power Test in Parliament ?
"
3082,"In the political history of Nepal, the session of Parliament is beginning to begin.
"
3083,"This time, the house has created curiosity and curiosity in the national and international areas.
"
3084,"It is clear
"
3085,"Nepalese people are pressured by the wilderness of the problem.
"
3086,"People are not able to feel peace and immunity because of the state's state-run terrorism by the name of political practice.
"
3087,"Political rights have been handed over to the ruling party and the main opposition party's weapon.
"
3088,"The Nepalese people, defined as sovereignty of the sovereignty, are forced to go astray without fear and horrific circumstances.
"
3089,"The expensive , artificial deficiency and black breeding have been developed as a synonym of democracy.
"
3090,"Such a long period of time the change has changed in the country, the public does not even feel the change in the public.
"
3091,"The convention of the Parliament being started at such a delicate and rigorous moment has been very important and historical.
"
3092,"The public is now political warriors "" cock clash "" and "" test "" looking not in favor of narcissism.
"
3093,"Now the faith that can be attracted to the people by political ideology and revolutionary slogan is now awful.
"
3094,"The fact that the Nepali people can not afford to spend their borrowing in the Ganges of Assurance are similar and unpleasant.
"
3095,"Do not bother patience
"
3096,"Those who took responsibility for power operations and government operations, started to neglect the urgent need for the political development of political achievements to be developed immediately on economic - social reinforcement.
"
3097,"The economic relief was just taken as a political rally.
"
3098,"But what anxious form of the situation is that if most people are facing their minimum basic needs.
"
3099,"In such a situation, what is the basis for price reduction process ?
"
3100,"Such activities have to be resolved to become the people that are not worth the price.
"
3101,"The Congress government has to accept the fact that it does not allow such situation.
"
3102,"The old drama of little slogans and worthless will no longer work.
"
3103,"No reason for the solution
"
3104,"For any responsible government, the obligation of the sovereignty of its country and the security of the security of the people of their people is considered to be the first priority.
"
3105,"There is also a need for development and compulsion of these qualities to become more essential for the established government.
"
3106,"But to us , the Democratic uttaradayitvaprati loyal to the government, claiming that the glories of his gross neglect of these kartavyaharuprati.
"
3107,"The demand for relief to the people , these Congress leaders , have been repeatedly since the old system has fallen.
"
3108,"The available means and opportunities of employment have also been wasted and a huge financial crisis has reached Nepalis.
"
3109,"By reasoning for international reasons, those living in the government are trying to prove themselves the most expensive and the lack of things beyond internal control.
"
3110,"However, this government does not show any signs for any increase in national production and providing suitable employment opportunities for the people.
"
3111,"After thirty years after coming to power, the Nepali Congress has presented the budget first.
"
3112,"But of course , all the proposals and arrangements made by this budget have given India a very busy place.
"
3113,"Due to this situation, now the Nepalese people have created a clue of how to reach it.
"
3114,"These problems are the result of ignoring the government's reality of national reality , it can not be liable for the consequences of international situation.
"
3115,"Due to these problems, the Government has to show activeness on the basis of its resolve.
"
3116,"Upcoming budget
"
3117,"The direct impact of this financial compulsion coming to India is the present Nepalese Congress government has created a complex situation by inviting the economic situation of Nepal.
"
3118,"But in the earnings of most Nepalese people, one percent also has no basis for growth.
"
3119,"Not only is that it is impossible to maintain its current level of growth if there is an increase in employment opportunities.
"
3120,"But the hope of "" subsidis "" is not a place to do in this situation.
"
3121,"Therefore , this government can not fulfill its obligations for economic development until the current economic policy changes.
"
3122,"Due to this , the fact that the next budget has increased the cost of growth , expansion of foreign debt, and the possibility of expanding the prospects.
"
3123,"Socialist budget ?
"
3124,"From this, economic behavior from the periphery of the philosophical emotional terminology of economics will bring a great boost to the formation of a structural economy.
"
3125,"How many days will it take ?
"
3126,"Q . I . Girija's dissatisfaction is not too difficult to understand that his work-action is expressed as a rhetoric.
"
3127,"It is also a matter of knowledge that the government has shown the tendency for the movement to be so ridiculous.
"
3128,"But the fact that the government does not ignore the worst of doing so is not a matter of hiding.
"
3129,"So, we do not see any point in the logic that the government could not work as expected by the government movement.
"
3130,"Events are confirming the movement of the opposite movement by identifying the activists and after the appointed government to mislead him.
"
3131,"In spite of excessive prices, the government is also making non-mandatory efforts to blame other extreme reasons , not to its policies and policies .
"
3132,"We feel that the government's stupid statements have not been confused to the people , but also a vicious violation of the alleged provision of the constitution to be informed.
"
3133,"The discussion of this discussion is also being kept secret from Parliament.
"
3134,"Why ?
"
3135,"Why is the government limited to false propaganda instead of carrying such a policy of politics and trend before moving it ?
"
3136,"Why did the tour stop ?
"
3137,"Before reaching the final decision in relation to Nepal, there is no doubt that the incident has shown India's eye to another secret agreement with Koirala government.
"
3138,"Nevertheless, the Nepali people should have friendly friendship with India.
"
3139,"Therefore, the establishment of a good , far-reaching and long-term relationship with India is a question that can not be removed from any of the questions of the dismissal of those contracts.
"
3140,"What we ask if Indian national sovereignty and future should not be sacrificed in the rivalry of regional sovereignty and the influence of American imperialism.
"
3141,"Such unrecognized credibility should be given publicly and negotiating public in public.
"
3142,"Without this , Koirala , who is trying to take secret diplomatic tactics , will not be discriminating against the wishes of Nepalese people , but will be naturally doubtful.
"
3143,"Expensive killers and leftists ?
"
3144,"Today, a huge and sensitive issue of expensive Nepali population has become increasingly complex.
"
3145,"That is why today, the Consumer Forum, which is considered close to the Congress, has been keen to doubt the importance and value of the Chief Minister's control over the work.
"
3146,"The question is not only the resignation of the Minister of Supply , the Nepalese people and policy decisions are the responsibility of the government.
"
3147,"In the government, there is no sense of commitment to the public, no one will come back in the government.
"
3148,"In addition to publishing price list , market was operated accordingly , activating the showability and not related to that would be related to concerned people.
"
3149,"These are not upright and unwanted things.
"
3150,"On the other hand, there is no need to take seriously a ban on food leakage and ridiculous work to buy food from India on the other hand.
"
3151,"It has become more difficult to have a tendency to enjoy the favorite and decent food items.
"
3152,"The Maoist Congress party's integrity of the left-parties of the opposition parties is amazing for the people's implementation of public decisions in the name of people.
"
3153,"Time - time of the people they represent dearness lagaunabaheka slogan to control operation of programs doing ?
"
3154,"Come - his party's support, self-respect, he paripatibata freed of expensive anti-movement that can not run ?
"
3155,"How can people assert them if they are not able to get their economic burden on the public and even when they are killed ?
"
3156,"Expected expensive and government raids
"
3157,"But the policylessness shown by the government and the financial tendency of the party, the support of the trendy businessmen and the smallest traders of the big business, can not support anyone.
"
3158,"The government had shown its wrong policy by expanding the food clearance.
"
3159,"Now the government is not cost reduction , in situ, allowing only grow hypocritical thread appears to be working.
"
3160,"But does the government do so ?
"
3161,"How much is the government free of charge from the traders of the traders who shatter the businessmen ?
"
3162,"Ridiculous democracy
"
3163,"The leadership has come to think about it
"
3164,"Nepalese people have completed a state of drowning in the fatal deficit.
"
3165,"At this time, the MPs and the two opposition MPs are listening to people's anger in the district.
"
3166,"In some districts, the power party is favorable and some have ruled for the purpose.
"
3167,"The main question is that the government is working properly with the same speech as it is about to talk about how to address the problems of the people.
"
3168,"The government is not able to open the minds of most of the employees who are engaged in occupational rights on the other hand.
"
3169,"According to the order, according to the democratic system, both parties and opposition parties should seriously think seriously.
"
3170,"After all, for democracy only for a wealthy person or only a poor person to know for the poor.
"
3171,"If the government does not alert the government according to that direction, the democratic government is advised not to return to the people's assembly again after 3 years of democracy.
"
3172,"This democracy is being shaken by the people hoping for every vision.
"
3173,"The opposition is also increasing the interest in the public service, as it is just like fascinating creative cooperation.
"
3174,"Even the party's party is moving forward by not trying to get rid of the Panchayati tricks.
"
3175,"After ten decades after thinking about responsible parties in the institutionalizing democratic values ​​and beliefs and doing the good of the lower class.
"
3176,"How Much Little Constitution Day ...!
"
3177,"All the people have experienced little because the constitutional constitution of the multi-party democracy, which is being implemented and celebrated with great blessing, is not seen from all sides.
"
3178,"John wants to forge a multi-party system, but people with the same vigor as excited if not enhance , dictates can not progress.
"
3179,"The government commitment to relief to the people has proved to be wrong every time.
"
3180,"From our view, our availability looks great, but like Panchayat period, we have been beaten up in the boat, exploitation and oppression and have become a victim of serious problems.
"
3181,"In the presence of the Constituent Assembly, King , Prime Minister and the Honorable Leaders celebrated such a big constitution by giving one single statement.
"
3182,"But the people have not forgotten their past acquaintances in the last week of the last four weeks, the martyrdom of the country and the mass movement in the country.
"
3183,"That bone is black
"
3184,"However, the government has been stubborn considering seeing the government's constitutional devotion in the constitutional day of the Panchayati Kalam constituency.
"
3185,"In fact, this public has only formulated the formal government as long as it is.
"
3186,"There is also no indication that people can collect overall interest.
"
3187,"Its direct example is to celebrate the first constitutional day.
"
3188,"Of course, spending money is always wrong, but it is also a shock to deceive the duty by becoming fraternity too.
"
3189,"The first Constitution Day should be celebrated with grandeur but was ignored.
"
3190,"Does this mean that there is no government to ignore constitutional dignity ? The arguments are also raised.
"
3191,"Government to increase economic inequality
"
3192,"There are wrong decisions and practices used by the rulers who have caused damage to the nation.
"
3193,"Nepal's situation has become so close today.
"
3194,"The Congress government is running ' Rama Ram in the mouth , the razor in the bull ' .
"
3195,"They are not treated publicly.
"
3196,"The discussion of their fraud today has gone on every street street in the city.
"
3197,"When some independent journalists talk about this , it is not a new thing to beat the robbers , threatening journalists , threatening journalists .
"
3198,"Current government is encouraged to promote these illegal and public activities, which will not end every dignity of the court.
"
3199,"Here poor and innocent people have not done the dignity of the constitution.
"
3200,"Country is not involved in selling of labor.
"
3201,"They work.
"
3202,"Every day the labor creates a creation and lives through a hungry boat.
"
3203,"In relation to the above mentioned matter, do not show awareness about the time of being a people's movement of hunger nags ?
"
3204,"Wish it good night
"
3205,"We are coming back and again, great festivals have arrived in the face of ten.
"
3206,"This great festival is in the mouth of expensive, many rugs of harvesting will be expected from all together.
"
3207,"In such cases, it is difficult to tell you how delightful it is.
"
3208,"Again, it is estimated that the tenth festival is a tree that is among many problems.
"
3209,"There has been a huge change in the country, which the people of Nepal struggled.
"
3210,"But the problems of the public are the same, but more problems are covered on the head.
"
3211,"All people should feel like being depressed for more than 70 percent of Nepalese people living under the absolute line of poverty.
"
3212,"It has become a tremendous and dangerous form of this situation , which is expensive , corrupt , nephew , and security.
"
3213,"Due to this, inflation and wandering have been steadfast and every month, the value of consumer goods per month has increased by twenty percent.
"
3214,"The fact that it is worth mentioning of the government's inefficiency and self-determination.
"
3215,"After 5 months of the ruling government of Nepali Congress, there are no signs of improvement, but the government has been declining for improvement.
"
3216,"In this era, which has proved to be the world's best practices, multi-party arrangements have become disappointing in the recently renovated multi-party democracy.
"
3217,"In the Panchayat period, discussions have been made in the village that there was a provision of such things.
"
3218,"We have to be aware of this.
"
3219,"How successful is the first Parliament session ?
"
3220,"The first convention of the Parliament has now reached days of ending.
"
3221,"As far as the problems of the public are concerned, they are all the flights.
"
3222,"The government has not found success in the favor of increasing the expensive unemployment and peace security, particularly.
"
3223,"Although the formation of the government, it had to deal with the problems of the employee movement.
"
3224,"Suddenly the inflation increased beyond the control.
"
3225,"The situation in the past few months has remained unchanged.
"
3226,"The government could not handle any clear policy.
"
3227,"The government has just completed the form of formality.
"
3228,"The opposition parties raised the problems of the people in the house, but their words remained limited only in the cable dialect.
"
3229,"As a responsible opposition, the status of the Government could be compelled even if they had justified the formalities.
"
3230,"The nation is going through a lot of cowboys and Sangra situations.
"
3231,"But it seems that the full talk of this crisis is not even public representatives and government.
"
3232,"Clearly, the main element of the rehabilitation of this democracy is public.
"
3233,"The leaders had just directed.
"
3234,"Today, every three years after bringing democracy, leaders who sit and direction are looking forward to look forward to waiting for the people to wait for some time.
"
3235,"How long will the public make sure ?
"
3236,"Patterns inside the wall are also indicating a great disappointment.
"
3237,"Today politics is part of politics.
"
3238,"But this has been stolen from Bhandand.
"

"
3240,"Traditionally selling trademarks have become visible.
"
3241,"But still it's not time.

3244,"UN Secretary-General of the United Nations
"
3245,"Today, the main point of view of the world's insecurity is the Middle East.
"
3246,"On the other hand, permanent peace is going to be established.
"
3247,"If there were no peacekeepers in the peace process, the work would increase, and certainly the risk of global warfare would increase.
"
3248,"Even though the Middle East is a wilderness area, financially as a major oil production center, it is very important.
"
3249,"The world's biggest reason for the war between Iraq and Iraq has proved to be that oil politics has proved by the world's diplomats.
"
3250,"It has also been taken as a major influence on the United Nations of the poor nations of the world.

"
3253,"Q . I . Girija Prasad Koirala himself will soon go to India ' possibility ' of ministers to it.
"
3254,"With regard to Nepal - related relations, the Nepali Congress government has recently become a major political crisis in a major crisis.
"
3255,"If India is coming forward to the treaty of the old 1950's, then Prime Minister Girija is in a position to sign that agreement for his political patriotism.
"
3256,"The same thing is the same old way to distinguish between business and transportation.
"
3257,"If Nepal is giving pressure to the same agreement , Nepal will have a different deal .
"
3258,"The new ones are working new ones to solve the old question.
"
3259,"See , this is how much exercise is worthwhile and how successful visit of the Prime Minister of India ?
"
3260,"If the policy to eat or consume all the money given by the friend country is made, even when the Nepalese self-esteem is sold !
"
3261,"Manmohan's statement
"
3262,"Manmohan officials have not ignored the attention of the responsible counterpart's leaders , as it appears there.
"
3263,"However , Manmohan Adhikari, always full responsibility , balance and moderation are the things that has come so ?
"
3264,"Actually, the workers of UML have also wondered what to say.
"
3265,"Colmovo Announcement
"
3266,"South Asian Asian Cooperation Organization ( SAARC ) has passed through a tough test.
"
3267,"It is clear from the summit that is being completed in the wake of the endeavor of understanding this matter at the moment.
"
3268,"However, expected mobility within SAARC can not be said.
"
3269,"In fact, the main principle of SAARC spirit is also mentioned in this.
"
3270,"The solution of this community group is not easy.
"
3271,"Even though the speed of SAARC countries looking for ways to get rid of disease , hunger and illness , they are not even oriented towards the downward direction.
"
3272,"This statement recently announced that the Colomov's announcement released after the SAARC summit was held.
"
3273,"The Palmovo announcement of this shift has already taken place two important things.
"
3274,"In the Colmovo Announcement, these two preliminaries have evolved in real terms in the sense of communal community of SAARC countries.
"
3275,"Role of Opposition
"
3276,"What is the intention of such preaching ?
"
3277,"And who is this preaching ?
"
3278,"The answer to these two questions is to be clear and clear in the general public.
"
3279,"Today's basic question is a matter of stability to democracy.
"
3280,"After providing the stability to the democracy, the work of creating the most important development of the country after the completion of the task of making the instability was easily defeated.
"
3281,"The significance of democracy in this context is the stability and legitimacy of the elected government legitimately in the country's political future, as the two-way coin.
"
3282,"Can not say
"
3283,"The role of the Opposition in this scenario becomes very important.
"
3284,"It can not be more unfortunate for democracy's democracy.
"
3285,"This means that the opposition should support all the work of the government.
"
3286,"House of government work - kajaharuma if any error should be seen that the creative is inevitable, but yasto agitation and criticism is only just birodhakailagi.
"
3287,"However , in the question of national security and democracy, the Opposition should not only work by holding the opposition over itself.
"
3288,"At the same time, the protesters do not demonstrate the role of a dynamic character in another way in the House.
"
3289,"Teaching Hospital Case
"
3290,"Due to the so-called employees' strike, the situation has become anarchy in the country.
"
3291,"Gravavichov's victory
"
3292,"After the demolition of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorvachov, the most popular President of the Soviet Union, the entire dictator was abducted as a dictatorial dictator.
"
3293,"The Russian people themselves themselves attacked the road by stepping down on the streets by fierce the tanks.
"
3294,"US President George Bush told the great victory of the Russian people.
"
3295,"It is the victory of independence and democracy.
"
3296,"In fact, since the year 1917, in the Soviet Union, some people have borne a great person, that person is Gravavchowb.
"
3297,"Gorvachov, who rose above Lenin, has said in the whole world, as a man of democracy.
"
3298,"The great leader Greetings congratulate Gravavabov's re-return.
"
3299,"Language of parliament
"
3300,"Again, there is a debate on language issues in Parliament now that our parliamentarians have again re-emerged in a matter of conclusion.
"
3301,"In its constitution, Nepali languages have been given national language ( mother tongue ) to the language spoken in the country with other languages ​​and languages .
"
3302,"The Nepali language kit has all the contact language in the Parliament, but the Sadhavana Party has spoken in the party's contingency by frustrating its speech in Hindi.
"
3303,"After the dispute of the language, after the conclusion, it is seen that the party is particularly vulnerable to the party's commitment.
"
3304,"After Panchayat, Nepali people speak in favor of speaking, after being multi-poled, propaganda language is being propagated by the people of Multan.
"
3305,"In Parliament, now it comes to each parliament to reach a conclusion immediately on the issues of the Parliament.
"
3306,"Police action and politics
"
3307,"The campaign to make and sell wine in Dharan police and wider pavements S - small untouchable tanga, among others were affected.
"
3308,"It was hard to sympathize with the things that affect their livelihoods.
"
3309,"Thinking about alternative effects of gift effects may be a matter of concern for everyone.
"
3310,"But, here the Nepali Congress government sees the same thing for the poor, that election politicians see twelve months.
"
3311,"All this is important to understand.
"
3312,"The end of the Parliament
"
3313,"The first session of the general elected parliament formed after the historic mass movement has ended.
"
3314,"The importance of this session, which has been for about three months, is undoubtedly, and there has been a lot of democratic practice in this period.
"
3315,"However, the Opposition UML has done specially in this regard that many political parties have done so much to eliminate democratic practice.
"
3316,"However, some positive things of this convention should also be constructed towards a constructive direction in a practitioner, otherwise democracy can reach the danger.
"
3317,"This way our wish is to be blessed by Bhavani Mata.
"
3318,"Pollution in Bangladesh
"
3319,"Parliamentary system has been rehabilitated by the public opinion of the SAARC member and neighboring Bangladesh.
"
3320,"People have elected Parliamentary system in the public opinion system or election system to choose a government system.
"
3321,"After the establishment of democracy in Nepal, the mass movement of Nepal also influenced Bangladesh and there was democracy.
"
3322,"But since the old system had a systematic system, the government chief decided to make a public opinion, in which the people have chosen the parliamentary election.
"
3323,"This child democracy in Nepal and Bangladesh is now going on and it has to be a mutual interest in one another.
"
3324,"Prime Minister visits India

3328,"News has now become old for the employees to pressure on government to suppress their demands, as well as the capital of the country.
"
3329,"But today the fact that the same class became disabled became a result of this incident and activities.
"
3330,"But it is the most true that the problem and the situation remain unchanged by all means.
"
3331,"These employees died in a complex situation - staging utrisakeka, and more - much more complex situation being created will naturally has said.
"
3332,"The hull in the market is being sold extensively - as the condition could not grow before the results could not increase the result of the conversation.
"
3333,"Prison staff who are therein , Dhong or suspension - the letter is not phirtieko and movement ceased.
"
3334,"Now all the restraint required
"
3335,"In this situation, such negotiations can be fruitful and we wish that the mutual relations between the two countries can be reassured again.
"
3336,"It is not unrealistic to expect that the situation goes wrong and now there will be some realization.
"
3337,"This explains the severity of the situation.
"
3338,"If that happens, the stability of the government will be able to face the stability of the system, and the people will also be comfortable to return a lot of relief.
"
3339,"The government, which has a problem between the problem
"
3340,"If the country is surrounded by many problems, the government could not give any meaningful solution to it, which is getting worse.
"
3341,"It is natural to experience the experience of the dark clouds of an unexpected unhealthy possibility in the nation today.
"
3342,"Humdam - when the villagers have no accountability vulnerable people are citizens of the capital of drinking water Working apurba pyakapyaki problems became clear.
"
3343,"At such a chance, there was a huge loss of floods, floods, floods in Koshi, and an unusual natural crisis was added.

"
3348,"This is the convention paristhitikabica people - reflects and failure to paripurta natural thing.
"
3349,"In fact, the first national convention was not able to coincide with the initial convention and questioned the public's parliamentary presence.
"
3350,"Such a kind of experience has experienced another challenge to maintain the public's sovereignty and dignified parliamentary reputation.
"
3351,"The first session of what - as an end - it is everywhere, but were disappointed to maintain the parliamentary system has reached another complication jelina.

"
3353,"Government and employees' association
"
3354,"In the country, in the country, the obligatory employees have shown that the movement should be taken into action to fulfill their demands.
"
3355,"The fact that the employees considered as an important member of the government, struggling to get themselves into the street, can not get the reality that the public has to pay its highest payment.
"
3356,"This incident has also imposed the function of the democratic government.
"
3357,"And when there was a clear majority in multi-party system, the government could not run alone . A . The fact that the Leo of the Emma's refuge is possible to be recorded in history !
"
3358,"Happiness came to pass
"
3359,"Looking forward to the above policy and program, the policies and programs of the Government of Sri 5 are clearly visible to the Nepali Congress's sand.
"
3360,"The public has been insulted by giving only empty assurances to everyone in everything.
"
3361,"The Nepali Congress and opposition parties, UCPN (Maoist), are just ignoring the people in the interference of power for power balance.
"
3362,"Democracy threatens from the ruling coalition

"
3369,"Congrats seem to be sad because of the government being formed in the near future, Nepali Congress will be special and Left Left in opposition.

3370,"Be careful , Mr. 5 conspiracy is going on.
"
3371,"After the success of the successful People's Conquest last year, the Maharajdhajra government, 5, has been fully formed as a constitutional king.

"
3380,"The ruling Left Party can only know what kind of democracy in the present Left Kang to fight for the elections, which has been tried to bring the country to the country.
"
3381,"Whatever the meaning of ?
"

"
3388,"In the total election, the Nepali Congress had an opportunity to make 110 locations in the general election.
"
3389,"After 32 years, a single Nepali government has been formed in the country again.
"
3390,"The Koirala government does not see the simplest situation in the past, the interim government has seen the work taken by the people.
"
3391,"However, if Koirala government does not feel discrimination and repression on anyone, the situation seems to be gradually improving.
"
3392,"In the end, while congratulating Prime Minister Koirala and the other ministers of the cabinet, we pray for the veneration of all the people of the country to change peace.
"
3393,"Do not talk about non-responsibility
"
3394,"Former Agriculture Minister Jhalathath Khanal, who spoke to the public, said farmers are scarcely harassed by the farmers not sewing them.
"
3395,"Farmers have been forced to stay in line with 4 hrs in the distribution of sewage due to lack of work in the field.
"
3396,"Even formerly, the Minister of Ministers has looted the moral rights that they have to buy.
"
3397,"Likewise, the recent farming minister has to be disturbed by abusing others.
"
3398,"Parliament is the source of the cafes
"
3399,"The Parliament, which was formed after the People's Movement last year, has now failed to win the confidence of the people.
"
3400,"The convention of the Parliament has only been attributed to the ghetto of the Gaddafi due to the deliberacy of the Honorable Daman Dhangana of the Representative Assembly.
"
3401,"Section 6 ( 1 ) of Representative Assembly and Regulations have been clearly mentioned in 222.
"
3402,"Changes in Koirala's view
"
3403,"The . A . When the Girija party accused the Bhattarai party in interim , Bhattarai accused of encouraging communists and encouraging them.
"
3404,"Some Congressmen also objected to the Congress's Left Front support in the mass movement.
"
3405,"Even in the one-year interim government, the Left parties, who have joined the Left Front, have expressed open dissatisfaction.
"
3406,"Before elections and elections, Girija Prasad Koirala was known as an oppressed Communist leader within the Congress.
"
3407,"In the eyes of this, the names of maal , masala and mandate are from the same name.
"
3408,"Keeping in mind all these things may choose any kind of discount Communists remained Girija Prasad Koirala , concessions whether he was committed.
"
3409,"This change happened in such a sudden way that the obvious fall of change could be experienced by everyone.
"
3410,"Male , spices, and all of a sudden Girija Prasad Mandal see the same UML "" a responsible opposition "" as began to see.
"
3411,"There is no political reason for this change in sight . I . Koirala, neither any other Congressis from the party seen it open.
"
3412,"Congress's suppression has been unanimously elected in the meeting of the delegate.
"
3413,"The candidate selected the candidate for Jhalanath Khanal.
"
3414,"That is, the charge of the Girija party that Bhattarai encouraged and encouraged communists in the greed kept in power . I . Koirala also applies similarly.
"
3415,"Even after the election of the majority of the government, even the Communists walked under "" Shiropar "" , the Congress policy has begun unusual for many.
"
3416,"Shahi addressed weaknesses
"
3417,"With this, the royal conspiracy of this week has come to hear the remarkable comments in both the houses outside the house and outside the house.
"
3418,"When the royal address was considered as the promise letter of the Girija Parishipadishad, it should have been mentioned in the preliminary part of the government's work in one year.
"
3419,"In the address, the researchers say that the selection of vocabulary more than the program seems to be more difficult.
"
3420,"Many have been surprised to not mention the Panchayat system in address.
"
3421,"The leftists criticized this address as ""Panchayati"" continuity.
"
3422,"The Girija Ministership system seems to have read the policy of encouraging private sector.
"
3423,"Air service has been invited to private sector.
"
3424,"Addressing the landing policy is not clear in address.
"
3425,"Importance is important in the important matters of the earth , the landslide , the lands covered , the slums and their respiratory tracts.
"
3426,"Why is the need for national consensus in the present situation , to accept the consensus between the coconut as national consensus ?
"
3427,"Answer questions are not answered.
"
3428,"The address has been mentioned in the address of the policy, but its implementation is not strong enough to be implemented.
"
3429,"Information makers are not ready to acknowledge that the administrative device that is capable of enforcing the policy would be so freelance and honest.
"
3430,"Q. The program listed earlier . I . In the end, it is certain that Koirala has shown that the workers shown in relation to the workers.
"
3431,"Congress - the communist party and headed to confrontation
"
3432,"People's movement parties also urged the employees to move into the movement , the civil society and thousands of thousands of the employees were shifted to the movement.
"
3433,"Generally employees who were separated from politics made their "" organization "" and recognized the government on that organization.
"
3434,"The institute's employees are also divided into two organizations.
"
3435,"Now Nepal's government and seminaries are supporters of half-Congress and half-communist supporters.
"
3436,"Here, half of the numbers are not in account , according to politics, employees have got two drawings.
"
3437,"Anthropic staff are still aggressive.
"
3438,"Four employees are living in the moon festival.
"
3439,"Some are tired.
"
3440,"Some jobs were lost.
"
3441,"A few days ago, Manoj Joshi's police was shot dead in a clash with the employees' movement.
"
3442,"The leadership of the UML has reached the hands of the aggressive workers and thus the situation has become a tremendous massacre between the Congress and the counterpart UML.
"
3443,"The incident between the two leaders, including Manmohan Adhikari and UML, arrested by the police on Tuesday, can be expected to move further.
"
3444,"UML has already reached the road.
"
3445,"There is also a program of nationwide slogan Narul Joshash.
"
3446,"With this, the ruling Congress has also concluded the Congress.
"
3447,"The workers who want to be separated from political activity are worried about the Congress - Communist divisions make the democracy strong or weak ?
"
3448,"Only those days will answer correctly to this question.
"
3449,"In whose interest is the depreciation ?
"
3450,"The Girija Council of Ministers has created a new dispute by evaluating Nepalese currency.
"
3451,"Mudrasanga convertible Nepali currency devaluation reason "" depreciation of the rupee as "" bhannebaheka government has not been able to tell other reason.
"
3452,"The government is silent about what internal obligations of our country have to minimize the money.
"
3453,"Q . I . This new step of depreciation of Koirala's currency has unanimously imposed independent economists in any country that does not affect the country's economy.
"
3454,"From this incident, the Girija Municipal Council has also increased the expectations of national interest in the steps taken to make the country prosperous.
"
3455,"The dignity of the constitution
"
3456,"Because of the dignity of the constitution, the instances of political crisis, which are full of global history.
"
3457,"There are many parties in the name of the office and the office , but in practice , there is no mention of the reaction of others other than Nepali Congress.
"
3458,"The Nepali Congress has walked through the entire communication system.
"
3459,"But all of these activities are directly contrary to constitutional dignity.
"
3460,"Now let us talk about the public's expectations from the period of interim government, now after becoming a Congress government, it has already been a regular process.
"
3461,"Descent of the public is the basis of democratic values.
"
3462,"But by destroying the economic base of the people, this government is ignoring fundamentally based principles.
"
3463,"Which is, in fact, guaranteed for fundamental rights in the constitution, adverse.
"
3464,"It is also a violation of constitutional dignity.
"
3465,"This is the story of the sixth SAARC summit.
"
3466,"In the construction of SAARC, played a decisive role from Mr. 5 Virender.
"
3467,"The fall of the Soviet President Gorvichov
"
3468,"The various republics declined to be separated.
"
3469,"Soviet Union lost its dignity in global politics.
"
3470,"The current change in the power of the page has become two factors.
"
3471,"This agreement was against the recent referendum of Soviet people in favor of maintaining national unity in the country.
"
3472,"Gravavov's quest for economic and public reforms in Soviet society has been the only crisis since searching for capitalism.
"
3473,"Employees and Government
"
3474,"Nepal's civil servants' organization has kept a new record of the movement of 55 days long in Nepal's history, but the movement did not succeed.
"
3475,"Manoj Joshi was murdered in Khantong despite firing in various parts of the country while trying to political activist movement.
"
3476,"Due to the increasingly uncomfortable spread of the country, the Panchayat started spreading confusion , shocks to the Panchayat .
"
3477,"It also emerged as a threat to democracy.
"
3478,"The employees have talked with Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, after breaking the rally with the movement.
"
3479,"The Prime Minister has also assured the restoration of the deprived and excluded employees.
"
3480,"Its activities, like the food and exit of the workers and the workers of the hotel workers, were struggling with their demands.
"
3481,"The government needs to take concrete steps in order to prevent legal work and restore the workers again in their own services.
"
3482,"In order to successfully succeed the Prime Minister to do no strike for a year, then first, workers and employees need to take a break.
"
3483,"That is why the responsibility of such a confidence and understanding is the responsibility of the government, not the public.
"
3484,"100 days of Koirala government
"
3485,"There is a tendency to say that the Government has limited time to 100 days of any government government in Western countries.
"
3486,"The government could not work like that.
"
3487,"Prime Minister Koirala had said that the primary task of preventing peace and harmony with the government.
"
3488,"No government has been able to do anything worthwhile.
"
3489,"It is not good to say that the security situation is so good, even worse than this, the problem has become more expensive.
"
3490,"The artificial deficiency of daily consumables is now so high that pulses , rice and oil prices are changing like daily.
"
3491,"To stop this, the government has started to take over food items in the warehouse of Sahu Mahajan.
"
3492,"If it is to take food and leave it, the government will only be able to identify the workers.
"
3493,"Price control can be solid in the form of a smooth and practical program used smoothly.
"
3494,"The government has started working, commenting on this will not be so appropriate now.
"
3495,"The mechanism that has been written in power during the Panchayat period and the mechanism that has not been done for democratic rituals has been shown to be the weapon of his new policy.
"
3496,"He has shown that at the same place he has been affected by brother nephewism.
"
3497,"In present day, the opposite side is the Left side.
"
3498,"The government must come forward to bring a lot of change in legal and administrative form, after strengthening this understanding and democracy.
"
3499,"Gondo is still waiting to eliminate the revolutionary power democracy.
"
3500,"The failure of the elected government to become a source of emphasis on these elements.
"
3501,"So no democratic and progressive power should be made to prevent the government from working in the coming days.
"
3502,"It can go to an awesome counterpart of the failure of government.
"
3503,"But the government needs to learn lessons from the last 100 days.
"
3504,"Government can not run properly by allowing people to remain discontinued.
"
3505,"The thing is fine but . ..
"
3506,"The light of the democracy has been restored after a 30-year dark darkness in the country.
"
3507,"But today too, mentality and tendency have brought home to all public institutions.
"
3508,"General public aware of the common endeavor manisasammale the airport - the court , the office of the organizations feel the tradition of the old are morbidly.
"
3509,"Offer a bribe , sorsaphorsa , the urgency of the last of nepotism, favoritism, would be flattering easy things.
"
3510,"Corruption and black racing have not fallen sharply.
"
3511,"In this situation, it is not an unrealistic thing to get the feeling of warmer experience of democracy.
"
3512,"These things are absolutely necessary and are right.
"
3513,"There is no new experience except the public that democracy is just about to open offices of different parties.
"
3514,"After entering into a new phase in politics, we have not been able to print the real public in real life.
"
3515,"Why responsible parties can center themselves towards this direction ?
"
3516,"Establishment of Nepal Communist Party
"
3517,"This view has seen Nepal Communist Movement again again passing through crisis.
"
3518,"This situation has become the fastest polarization between Communists to provide the right direction to the vast majority of mass support of the country.
"
3519,"On Sept. 15, 19 9, India's Calcutta of India . According to Pushpa Lalal, 5 Nepali revolutionaries formed the Communist Party of Nepal and issued a declaration of the party.
"
3520,"The past 43 years have shown that the party took the birth of its original politics that was true.
"
3521,"The revolutionary force is now doing various publications that the democracy does not spread in Nepal to end up recently established democracy in the country.
"
3522,"They have found a feeling of how economic stability could be maintained in the country by increasing domestic anger within the democratic parties.
"
3523,"In such a situation, Nepali Communist workers have felt the need to extend the duty of their Nepali people, working towards the strength of democracy.
"
3524,"Contemporary day reference
"
3525,"The agreement of the Nepal Republic has reached a year of 2047.
"
3526,"Self-determination itself is an achievement of the perspective that the struggle for bringing this alliance itself.
"
3527,"Therefore, the behavior and actions of that contradiction reject rejectionism.
"
3528,"Looking from this point , the power and the antagonist should not show that the enthusiasm , speed and compatibility should be displayed for the dignity of the convention.
"
3529,"However, some of the things have also been seen in contrast to the motive and emotion of the association and the opposite of the policy.
"
3530,"However, some of the things in the organization are not incomplete.
"
3531,"However, not everyone has accepted this agreement as a minimum consent.
"
3532,"Therefore, the attention of everyone must be focused on increasing non-constitutional things of public opinion by promoting first-party oppositions.
"
3533,"Population Growth Problems
"
3534,"How many people are there in the world ?
"

"
3540,"The sixth billion figure is estimated to be completed in the 11-year period.
"
3541,"One such threat has been growing rapidly - the number of poor and developing countries where it is mainly the most.
"
3542,"The problem of population growth is often over in most developed countries.
"
3543,"Even though various programs are being implemented for preventing population growth in developing countries, the lack of funds has not been able to achieve successful success.
"
3544,"Siksakobata public - sadharanamajha awareness program to bring this problem to some extent can be resolved priority.
"
3545,"Franchise and defective election process
"
3546,"Due to this defective election process, today the country is passing on serious political , economic and moral problems.
"
3547,"On this important question, the enlightened politicians , journalists , intellectuals and thinkers of the country have not suggested that there should be improvement.
"

"
3558,"Nepal especially if that means - the law is dominated by Indian traders.
"
3559,"Large tomorrow - factories are Indian merchants.
"
3560,"If there are large buildings of Indians and so on in India, there is a number of Nepali laborers anywhere.
"
3561,"Even here, by eating labor by sweating sweat , there should be prey in any province of provincialism.
"
3562,"In place - the police should bear the arrest of foreigners.
"
3563,"It should be a panic for years.
"
3564,"In many places the police should be hiding and hiding.
"
3565,"If the mouth talk and talk to each other, just like the people are celebrated.
"
3566,"In this case, our voice , the Parliament building, and bring to a sansad not.
"
3567,"A leader does not plead for us , the Union - the institution is not.

"
3570,"We are accomplishing the moth , torn , inasmuch as life - live it to it.
"
3571,"There is a problem of selling for Nepal to travel to India, and in India, any Indian is seen in any part of Nepal which has made a simple journey without a simple journey.
"
3572,"We need such a firm organization to get rid of the problem of increasing the problems of regional Nepalis in the troubles of Indian Nepalis.

"
3579,"' Split and rule ' is now the weapon because Western propaganda is in the hands of the armies of Bush and his friends.
"
3580,"The information we receive is news received from the western media.
"
3581,"What kind of excuse !
"
3582,"A large country like India has not yet developed its independent information system.
"
3583,"And not only ordinary listeners or viewers have any interest in the news received from the Gulf War - a sadness or a speech.
"
3584,"The world is curious once again for the liberalization of Western socialism.
"
3585,"The need for a permanent and fair government in the center
"
3586,"Indian politics has reached an endangered journey.
"
3587,"There is no such political party in the country that has national nature.
"
3588,"The role of the Indian National Congress in the freedom struggle, has played a glorious place in history.
"
3589,"The role of non-Congressist political parties is even more frustrating than Congress.
"
3590,"At the center of two years, there is a realization of anarchy in the real sense.
"
3591,"Small and come from disadvantaged families of the kingdoms - their regional problems which are in desperate need of a stable government is conciliatory center.
"

"
3593,"According to him, a strong and fair government is formed in the center to ensure the development of the country.
"
3594,"S . N . T . Notable achievement
"
3595,"The important department of public sector of Sikkim - the development journey of Sikkim Nationalized Transportation will remain united in the history of this small Himalayas.

"
3601,"This plan must be made between two or three months [ April from September to September ] because these six months will affect the full financial year.
"
3602,"In such a financial perspective, mid-term elections are being made in the country.
"
3603,"These choices are inevitable because there is a stable government in the country center. .
"
3604,"Lok Sabha elected and Sikkim
"
3605,"Today people are using democracy ?
"
3606,"Therefore, the feeling of self-awareness among the citizens of the conscious society is found to be centered on the search of the alternative.
"
3607,"The leaders who are involved in chair politics, after defeat of election, after election election, Viralo is going to differentiate themselves like different people.
"
3608,"As a result of a chair worship, the stability of the democracy has become uncomfortable and the ego has touched its peak.
"
3609,"Such a diverse activity is witnessed in the last year of the year 2007, the democracy achieved in the year 2007.
"
3610,"Why are the oldest rings in democracy ?
"
3611,"The current government and were on the job skill - the activities concerning the hinges - Comment Many have started.
"
3612,"This concept should be considered to be somewhat acceptable.
"
3613,"There is no bias on what the Government should bear to bear its result in not able to reflect the wishes and expectations of the people.
"
3614,"Instead of starting a new system by adopting the old Panchayat system, the post and chair is not a place to spend time in Tanan.
"
3615,"We feel that we should still reach out to the direction of bearing our responsibility by internal stubbornness and duality.
"
3616,"The ruling party needs to think seriously about it.
"
3617,"We consider duty to express our consensus on the common idea that the national origin is not centered on the matter and it should not be abused by national empowerment.
"
3618,"Democratic convention ends ?
"
3619,"What bill of convention passed by the democratic process passed the land and the public ?
"
3620,"The classical perspective did not have a panic ?
"
3621,"And can enforce the rights provided in association ?
"
3622,"People will be convinced only in that same thing , otherwise, ' nobody will be wondering ' after the Karaar slogan, ' Kaj wished.'
"
3623,"See , how will the conventions achievement be implemented publicly on the coming days ?
"
3624,"Dental and lack of democracy
"
3625,"In Nepalese society Vijaya Dasmi's significance , the heart and heart of human relations are associated with that moment.
"
3626,"It is not a good sign that people who are enthusiastic at the strength of democratic values ​​and beliefs become more disappointed this year.
"
3627,"In fact, the dynamics that took place with hunger have become increasingly common.
"
3628,"This is the introduction of a skilled ruler.
"
3629,"Such catastrophic political crises facing the vice president - understand and to maintain the slight lead without disturbing the 80 hours of unsuccessful attempts to sadayantrakariharuko.
"
3630,"The conspiracious momentary game has ended when the unturned president left the rest and returned to Moscow.
"
3631,"He is sending the best wishes and congratulations to the world's top leaders.
"
3632,"Now President Gorbachov has been released from the danger of his meditation.
"
3633,"Gorbachov has become known as a dictator of the world's belief in converted politics.
"
3634,"There is no need to comment on the efficient governance system of Gorvichov here.
"
3635,"An unprecedented event and the world's support and reaction on him are a fantastic example.
"
3636,"Democratic slogan , non- democratic activity ?
"
3637,"It is well known that people suffering from panchayat have not received relief during the time of democracy.
"
3638,"Its fabulous example has been lost in some days in a few days.
"
3639,"There have been some unexpected incidents that have changed the decision by the government to the public.
"
3640,"When the government has presented any statement of ideology, the people are now compelled to get hurt in the name of hopeful democracy.
"
3641,"As a result of the assurance of the past, Khokro slogan turned into a slogan, the Samajya government has already confronted the ruling government.
"
3642,"In the future, what is coming next day.
"
3643,"Publicity is reduced to democracy
"
3644,"People have got a new experience in the country after constituting the government approved by the public.
"
3645,"Some unpleasant events went down to spread , write , write , get older than someone who was leaping on the road.
"
3646,"Compared to the past and present of peace - security , discipline, economic , social and political failure and etc. are the true test will be maintained.
"
3647,"Now people facing a great national festival ' Dashain ' has come.
"
3648,"The peas are crying in the farmer's house.
"
3649,"Deposits have stolen the dead.
"
3650,"People are born.
"
3651,"This festival has been poor for the poor.
"
3652,"In this situation, will the public support the government ?
"
3653,"This disorder situation has become unfortunate in the name of democracy.
"
3654,"Code of Conduct and Peace Security
"
3655,"All the parties are doing all the tasks for recruiting the code of conduct code prepared by mutual-party parties in the country.
"
3656,"There is no possibility of peaceful voting while talking to party-level violence and terrorism.
"
3657,"The Prime Minister has clearly stated that the army could be operational in order to complete the general elections in a clear way.
"
3658,"If the army should take help in ordering democratic elections after the interval of 32 years, then it will not be more unfortunate.
"
3659,"But all the parties who claimed to conserve and promote new democracy have said this.
"
3660,"Answer: The answer to this question is definitely no answer with all those parties who come to terror.
"
3661,"The . A . , UML , RPP one inch and one inch above the floor, rather, mutual abuse, accused of spreading.
"
3662,"In Sindhupalchowk and Salan, the Nepalese Congress , which saw Gandhya's sculpture of Pashupati Sishir Marichman , considered responsible for the violent war in Morang , Sunsari and Tantlejung ?
"
3663,"Did many of his workers take action against him in respect of the place in which they were ?
"
3664,"Where did the moral ethics where the other party condemned the terror ?
"
3665,"UML, who threatens to get rid of the party, does not hesitate. What opinion about rapic attack on Rappa Thapa's worker and murder ?
"
3666,"' How far away and what status is the untouchable of the allegation of the UCPN (Maoist) accusing Nepali Congress, who violates democratic dignity and election code of conduct ?
"
3667,"In their counterparts, to successfully succeed in creating a mass movement, the party and its workers are completely unfortunate for this state and newborn democracy.
"
3668,"Today, various organizations of different names have come to exist for the sake of free and fair elections.
"
3669,"But even after a few days to complete the election, these organizations have not been able to do anything more than seminars in Kathmandu.
"
3670,"The government of Sri 5 also had to monitor the financial resources and activities of such organizations.
"
3671,"The waiting for the historic convention
"
3672,"After the end of the multi-party system internal affairs and the dictatorship Panchayati system, the first Parliament session is going to start the mid-January of this Friday.
"
3673,"Opposition will also work to raise awareness by the opposition and on the side of the people towards the problems of the people and its solutions.
"
3674,"But in the same way only if the house is limited, it will not be different from the Panchayati yacht.
"
3675,"There will be three streams of political stability in the upcoming house.
"
3676,"Parliamentary monarchy and multi-party arrangements of the Nepali Congress , Parliamentarians of the new People's Party and the People's People's Front , in the multi -party agenda.
"
3677,"The Teraiabad of Nepal Sadhavanaana Party will also be explicit in Parliament.
"
3678,"There will be criticism of the government from the UML, which will not allow the unbelievable opportunity opportunities and politics of convenience.
"
3679,"That is why the ruling party will be in favor of democracy , government and Parliament , working in favor of the people .
"
3680,"The workers have been able to get started on the road , the employees have proved their dissatisfaction .
"
3681,"The teachers have also indicated that they are not silent.
"
3682,"In this situation, how many sections of the society should attract and grow ?
"
3683,"It is realistic to raise a question.
"
3684,"All the spoken languages ​​are spoken but the common people are silent.
"
3685,"The illustration that the spoken flame of a speaking tongue does not sell is also not worthwhile.
"
3686,"The dictatorship arrangement did the Interim government ignore the general public.
"
3687,"In the history of history, the government should be harsh.
"
3688,"If Panchayats have the best option then others should also have the option.
"
3689,"But in this case, public sentiment and politics cache palkieka-UML opposition to the fireplace in the ghatakaharule come - his political bread hit the doors.
"
3690,"That is why the government should work and show clear and solid work.
"
3691,"Fateh's religion
"
3692,"Except the exception, all the workers of the Panchayati regime were cracked, and Shailendra Kumar Upadhyay was in the panchayat period in the names of Fateh and Nehaljaj.
"
3693,"We do not have the Panchayat rally in favor of the Secretary and the Marichaman as a good one.
"
3694,"In fact, we are in favor of the same thing.
"
3695,"We are also convinced that our Nepali Congress has agreed.
"
3696,"The maximum number of people in the last elections of Panchayat was known as Shailendra Ku . Upadhyay was the same.
"
3697,"This discussion did not have a good deal.
"
3698,"When the Nepalese relations reached extreme levels between Nepal and the disadvantages of the Nakas, then Prime Minister Shailendra Kumar Upadhyay was in Iran.
"
3699,"It is clear that it is clear that Nepal is not a foreign minister like Shailendra, as foreign minister, whether traveling abroad and tourism abroad was the importance and attraction of the dream.
"
3700,"Politics is the art of making a fool of the people, but now ' diplomacy religion ' through Shailendra Kumar Upadhyay, the politics are trying to make the vebakupha.
"
3701,"But in order to hide their sins, the writings of Battaniith did not fail to write the religion of Bhataii and cover it on their own.
"
3702,"Everyone knows that the king has got the pillar of the king and the work of a patriarch will protect the king and increase the possibility of victory.
"
3703,"In such a situation, King King was just like saying that there was a water-immune barrier to tell my differences.
"
3704,"The challenges of the new government are
"
3705,"There is a lot of work for the Nepali government to do so, and there is a lot of challenges and opportunities for it.
"
3706,"Of course, it is not less difficult for the Panchayati system to lay the dung of the waste garbage for three years and put it on a fixed path.
"
3707,"But it is not impossible to maintain expensive control and peace security.
"
3708,"If expensive committees and commerce companies are earning properly, the cost of expensive becomes expensive.
"
3709,"But for this, the government should adopt the hardship of the mullah.
"
3710,"But a congregation within the Nepali Congress will certainly have to make a difference for its own selfish interest.
"
3711,"This is the root of the root of most problems in the country.
"
3712,"And the Panchayati system is the main reason for economic prosperity.
"
3713,"Because of that, investigating the corruption in Panchayati period, the problem can be found to a large extent of this problem.
"
3714,"Apart from this, strict tree should be authorized on the traffickers of the industry.
"
3715,"The establishment of the alleged industry of luxury goods should be stopped immediately after the death of the country and spending dollars.
"
3716,"It is one of the problems facing the country as well.
"
3717,"There is no such squirrel in this country.
"
3718,"Real Sukkur residents do not know that land is found.
"
3719,"Today , there is a problem of agriculture and employment in the country , farmers do not get the goods at cheap prices if the farmers do not get the right value for their production.
"
3720,"Due to the limitations of employment and the influx of those who reach it, a large class of society is suffering from unemployment and young power is getting lost.
"
3721,"The . Cu . And shared river
"
3722,"One year after the formation of an interim government has passed.
"
3723,"People have changed the power and change of speech by the people of Panch princes.
"
3724,"People are an integral part of the nation.
"
3725,"This should be remembered by a politician or organization of politics.
"
3726,"Before the mass movement, India had made financial sanctions to the whole of Nepal.
"
3727,"While committing this, the Prime Minister of Interim government, in a hurry, said that all the rivers were wrecked to Nepalwat India.
"
3728,"This question is very serious , Nepal, India, who were swept from rivers cinavata.
"
3729,"Apart from Nepal, it is neither China nor the Indian.
"
3730,"Common Nepali intellectuals also have no obligation to accept that the Prime Minister delivers the Delhi Darbar by announcing the share of the river only by the people of Asia.
"
3731,"One of the main issues in the mouth of the general election has come before the Nepali people.
"
3732,"People have begun to say , not a vote should sell the licensed nation.
"
3733,"One vote should not be subject to the importance of foreigners, and a vote progresses to the nation , guide the long-lasting governance system , a vote of every Nepali.
"
3734,"Giving the assurance , greed and threat, reaching the verse is called the teachings of imperialism.
"
3735,"Even if honest politics is to show the right path to the people and to the nation, faith also increases in Parliamentism.
"
3736,"The Nepali Congress's Hochu election policy has already started.
"
3737,"The name of democracy has increased in December.
"
3738,"Machiavism has increased.
"
3739,"Now the doubt is that the contract of democracy will be reached within the palace court due to the Khokro autumn given to Nepali Congress.
"
3740,"Regarding things, people will accurately evaluate the election, this is the main requirement of today.
"
3741,"The masses in the electoral field
"
3742,"Participants in the constituency , especially in Nepali Congress , UML and the People's Democratic Republic Party, have seen such activities.
"
3743,"Nepali Congress , UML and Panch parties have been accused of "" they are coming to the field to fight."" '
"
3744,"Is there a parliament asserting that the Fattu assurance hut and the gutting point is not seen by Jhalmal before ?
"
3745,"Democratic country, citizens themselves are the owner of the land , the owner of evasion , dhantne weapons master, no job is too long duration.
"
3746,"So the people and the country are looking for a honest political servant.
"
3747,"The smart election that the party tries to complete , the people will try to win the party and this is the purpose of the public.
"
3748,"Beware !
"
3749,"Do not rush
"
3750,"The last day of the general elections is today's day.
"
3751,"Anxiety concerns that whether or not it is possible - information related to people related to their ancestors is taking information.
"
3752,"Why did the Royal Nepalese Army come forward in the general election, according to the democratic system ?
"
3753,"Itself is a surprise ?
"
3754,"The Nepali Congress, which is the supreme ruler in power, has made a nationwide terror anxiety.
"
3755,"By promoting this kind of trouble, the Nepali Congress itself is facing surpassedness towards the inconvenience and the terror environment is more than the Nepali Congress.
"
3756,"The people are in search of support from a 30-year-old Nantukash system , not to rebuild new nervousness.
"
3757,"Economic development , social change , end of corruption, and development of discipline development today
"
3758,"If the common election plays a crucial role for the development of all these things, the people will not leave anyone if there is a rugged election.
"
3759,"The government became , challenge many
"
3760,"The situation has made some way more than the thought of time.
"
3761,"Became ! !
"
3762,"Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala.
"
3763,"After the election results, the scholars declared their reaction - ' The majority of this Nepali Congress is the implications of the panchayas . '
"
3764,"In fact, the public has proved that for 30 years, the Panchas have not really ruled an uncontrollable regime.
"
3765,"The movement of the ' MLAs ' movement is only in the valley ! '
"
3766,"By rejecting the Panchayat language, the public has proved it.
"
3767,"Rato stalemate Prajatantra place - where there are tents, walked "" We go to the populace, except ' that.
"
3768,"But no one mentions the definition of the public, except for the charge of Cable Congress Communist, their mouth does not come from anything.
"
3769,"Jehos leave the old thing.
"
3770,"The country's contemporary reign has reached the polygon of Nepali Congress.
"
3771,"Nepali Congress leadership is in the hands of Girija Prasad Koirala, and Communist Party of Nepal (CPN-UML) has been strong.
"
3772,"Any movement must be acknowledged by the movement that was especially from these two groups.
"
3773,"People do not even have the intention to stay comfortable with the people.
"
3774,"At the moment, the professional people are in billboards , no profession is safe in Nepal.
"
3775,"The number of unemployed has increased due to lack of employment opportunities.
"
3776,"The stomach , the deficiency is increasing three times before the time.
"
3777,"The traders have been exposed to inflation within the aggressive period.
"
3778,"Dearness prajatantrasangasangai people , problems and lack of honest intention , peaceful, clothing , and shelter are the desire to have.
"
3779,"A challenge to the Congress government
"
3780,"Today, pluralism has been established in the country , but it is not the peak of success.
"
3781,"Girija Prasad Koirala gave a message in the name of Deshavishi on the day of Prime Minister's words - "" There is no political debate in the country. '
"
3782,"There is no logic that the change should be changed if there is a change in the power of Congress and the Nepali Congress should be in a weekend in a week.
"
3783,"But the leaves of the fruitage plant is a parable to be smooth.
"
3784,"People 30 / 30 years Panchayat perungoma hanging down , it can not be said that the Nepali Congress and deny reality.
"
3785,"The declaration of Nepali Congress election has also been mentioned in the next 10 years, to make Nepal a mini Singapore.
"
3786,"But Nepalese people do not want to reach Nepal in such a short period of time.
"
3787,"At least , propped hit upon christmas , employment problem not , a day to live on that day net positive trends , stay !
"
3788,"This is the desire of Nepali people.
"
3789,"The time is variable and it is human to make it in the confederation of the change.
"
3790,"It is said that according to the time that our requirement should be fulfilled, it is only mere immortality.
"
3791,"It is a natural right to get fruit according to our labor.
"
3792,"Today the Nepali Congress has a government.
"
3793,"I helped the Nepali Congress to win the election or supported Nepali Congress in the movement and common unrest , so I should get a job.
"
3794,"I have to earn money.
"
3795,"I should build a house, etc. If someone says that he is a businessman and a businessman.
"
3796,"The deal is to make a deal.
"
3797,"This is the feeling of dedicated citizens to the Nepali Congress today.
"
3798,"Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala will now be able to protect the country or complete his tenure by completing the wishes of dealers.
"
3799,"People's First House
"
3800,"The first House of People's elected members of the Parliament is starting from Thursday at around 1 am.
"
3801,"This house is not the king's shadow , the blood of the Nepalese people and the martyrs of the Nepali people are beginning to begin.
"
3802,"Also, disappointment capsules are coming.
"
3803,"That is why the republicans are 'the only way to mislead the Parliament's empire.' '
"
3804,"What are you saying
"
3805,"However, people can also change the argument if honestness and ethics are considered to be witnesses.
"
3806,"Because of this house, it does not have to be contradictory because the rebellion is not merely honest ?
"
3807,"There will be speaking of two political parties within the House - ruling Nepali Congress and opposition leader.
"
3808,"Therefore, the Nepali people have hoped that ' this House will take care of the work according to the work ' .
"
3809,"As witnessing this, we carry the hope of all people to remember those who were in the house, that they would not be deceived.
"
3810,"Prime Minister's Emperor and his Minister !
"
3811,"This is a very sensitive question to be able to raise.
"
3812,"In his cabinet , he does not leave his own minister , whether there is a claim claiming that the Chief Minister's instructions work separately ?
"
3813,"Assurance does not die publicly
"
3814,"People expected a lot from elected government, but Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala made all the parties in despair.
"
3815,"All aspects of the interim government of Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai guarantee was - ' elected by the government will solve all the problems ' that.
"
3816,"The . A . Will be black in history
"
3817,"Today the infantry is being blamed from around the world.
"
3818,"Republicans , neurologists , and conservatives are joining together jointly against anti-democracy activities .
"
3819,"Those who are worried about the interests of the people and the party more than the interests of the country and the people are filled with rigorous responses to the innocent people of innocent people.
"
3820,"Surely, for the durability of democracy, such things are fatal.
"
3821,"Various elements of the country are creating an environment of violence and terrorism, and they are looking forward to peaceful security.
"
3822,"They are also making their weapons to labor laborers , employees , residents , students, and so-called professors.
"
3823,"This strategy of republican and unilateral or neutralists is followed by the policy of the South American region extremist Che Guevara.
"
3824,"Bhara had rebelled in Cuba for the help of the Soviets, and made the President to Fidel Castro.
"
3825,"Bhara has done many such activities, whose blindness is now being done by UML.
"
3826,"If so much money is to be in the country, then more foreign debt should be added to the public or 75% of the public's publicity should be taken.
"
3827,"Anyone who may have the state's status at that time?
"
3828,"The insult of blood of martyr is not good
"
3829,"Employee problem is no longer a specific issue.
"
3830,"Therefore, according to Madan Bhandari, the UML has again taken students and traffic entrepreneurs on the road with the intent to collapse the government.
"
3831,"If there is no significant impact on the threat of closing traffic service in the country, the UML is sure to use it again.
"
3832,"The . A . Pa . ( Torch ) recently as vargadusmanako court and the Nepali Congress and the new democracy slogan has been forwarded.
"
3833,"Joint Janmauri and UML have also held the same slogan before the same slogan, and for the purpose of achieving this goal, Left Shakti has made the task of integrating the work together in the general assembly.
"
3834,"Therefore, the UML also ruled out the King and Nehru during the coordination center . A . The main class is seen to resume the ideology of policy.
"
3835,"Due to these and many such incidents - the party has started showing faith in the UML even more.
"
3836,"Due to the publication of blood in the people's movement of the year 2046, instead of bringing new people's democracy, restoration of democracy is to be done.
"
3837,"Vamasaktiharule has . A . There is also democracy in the people's movement.
"
3838,"Nepal Treaty New India
"
3839,"Nepal - India with regard to the new treaty, both countries are now considering the high level - to discuss ongoing.
"
3840,"People who are interested in political matters often do not know what India offers.
"
3841,"Apart from the terms laid down by the Treaty of 1950, apart from the terms of fulfillment of the new treaty, some other conditions have also been kept and maintained by India.
"
3842,"India's conditions are sufficient to confirm the national interest can not be changed even after the government and arrangement is restored.
"
3843,"This is an example of the proposal that King Kanu's team has returned to Nepal at a high level.
"
3844,"Since now India has raised such an agreement, it has made Nepal feel difficult to have a diplomatic region.
"
3845,"On the other hand, India has presented a new proposal regarding Karnali Survey to Nepal.
"
3846,"The government and the opposition parties have come to think deeply despite the solution of this situation.
"
3847,"The current law has also given great rights to opposition parties.
"
3848,"The use of that right is opposition parties only to oppose each step of the government.
"
3849,"The story of antagonist policy and monsters
"
3850,"After the restoration of multi-party system, the solid decision of the Parliament is going to end without the first session of the Parliament.
"
3851,"The convention will end on May 5.
"
3852,"The reason for estimation is that the Parliament Secretariat has brought only the program for Parliamentary meeting till September.
"
3853,"Normal practice occurred.
"
3854,"If MPs of the High Commissioner and the ruling MPs were not exact in Qayot, the UCPN (Maoist) and the joint Janmaurat would oppose the Parliament.
"
3855,"Now the only one to thank the Congress MP is only one , and that's what they saved the parliamentary system.
"
3856,"The same fall and similar mental bankruptcy has affected the parliament of this time too.
"
3857,"So people have no interest in this convention showed little ghatihalnu parliamentary convention mahatvapahilo pakatamai good - not a mark.
"
3858,"Such a situation enhances the possibility of responding to reactions.
"
3859,"The CPN-Maoist and CPN-Maoist have been promoting the power of power.
"
3860,"Every time UML has to follow the Parliamentary move, he is not leaving politics ""from the House to the streets "" .
"
3861,"If you give me a look, I will chase you, if you do not hurt me . ""
"
3862,"The pride of the UML forces is breaking the Congress intelligence.
"
3863,"Of course, if the antagonist forces were responsible for the public, it would certainly have been high for the parliamentary convention.
"
3864,"V . P . Worker and Girija Babu
"
3865,"Heavenly v . P . When Koirala was prime minister, he lived in Tripuraeshwar , Kathmandu.
"
3866,"Why did you sleep here ? ""
"
3867,"V . P . The answer was given - "" elected by the people, I am the son of the Prime Minister.
"
3868,"But I have already begun to say that you are now boxing.
"
3869,"It's not a good idea.
"
3870,"The administration is planning to improve the administration , but the family of Rana and Shah will become a barrier barrier.
"
3871,"That's why I have got a great mental upheaval.
"
3872,"In order to remove the same mental anxiety, I have come to sleep alone. ""
"
3873,"In the following days we . P . The administration has improved.
"
3874,"Even if Rana's trusted people had taken the hands in confidence with the hands, he had given some leave.
"
3875,"He was very upset to change the rituals.
"
3876,"Admin V. Regarding the spirit of the people, despite the pressures and exhortation of the Sardar of Shri5 and Shri 3's radar . P . Made it.
"
3877,"Current Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala is brother-in-law.
"
3878,"V . P . The problems facing him are being recurred before him.
"
3879,"But he has not yet realized the ability to handle brother's ability and diplomacy.
"
3880,"The time he passion , energy , enthusiasm and courage, and it is time to show confidence in him and the firm will be required.
"
3881,"Otherwise, the counterpart can ridicul the democracy and re-establish a coalition or independent system that is sought by the counterpart.
"
3882,"We have a complaint with America
"
3883,""" There is no formal relationship with the United States Bhutan.
"
3884,"Therefore, it is not appropriate to comment on the situation. ""
"
3885,"These statements are not ours , US ambassador to Nepal is Julia Chengkuck.
"
3886,"He spoke to the English authorial magazine "" Spotlight "" on the current one issue.
"
3887,"The questioner asked for a counterproductive reaction in Bhutan from the monarchy used on democratic powers.
"
3888,"Details of the Bhutanese People's Day Movement in the Statesman newspaper of the last August 23 have been published in detail.
"
3889,"The official sources of these details are made to Indian authorities.
"
3890,"According to the newspaper, Bhutanese King Jigme Sigme has been forced to leave the country of Bhutanese citizens of 40,000 Nepalese origin by hunting a huge number of people.
"
3891,"They have crossed Nepal and India.
"
3892,"The Bhutanese issue is a challenge to the world's democracy in relation to human rights.
"
3893,"The country is sunflower
"
3894,"As per the proximity to the general election, the growth has increased in the party's domination.
"
3895,"The country has emerged as the sun in the wake of the election commission separating the Sun sign for the UML.
"
3896,"People have now understood that communal issues raised by the people living in panchayat were massacre.
"
3897,"People from the Uchichi to Mahakali are convinced that only the UML can solve the problem of caste problems like Panchayat raised.
"
3898,"The presence of the officer has made most of the areas in the district including Sunsari and Morang.
"
3899,"The campaign of the Valley run under the leadership of the party general secretary has not filled the Jangir in the entire Middle East and western regions.
"
3900,"Kaski, where the famous tourist center and the capital of western region, Pokhara , have completely formed the sun.
"
3901,"Now there is no doubt that Kaski has three seats in UML.
"
3902,"The results appear in the eastern gate Jhapa today.
"
3903,"The strong fortune of the UML is not a sign of victory from other places in the Jhapa.
"
3904,"Today, the whole nation appears in favor of the agenda ahead of responsible politics, and the country has become a flurry.
"
3905,"Take care of steps carefully to grow before enthusiasm with sun flag carriers.
"
3906,"Representative of People's Liberation UML
"
3907,"And v . NO . Since 1960, the machine massacre in the country came to the machine to turn the wave into a shaft.
"
3908,"In Nepal since the time of Chandra Shamsher, Communist publicity has been started in the public.
"
3909,"In 006 years, in order to increase the expectations of the people in a static manner, in order to increase the velocity of the struggle . A . Pa . Was established
"
3910,"The same year, people's power ' black marketing ' of power in living in harmony with a stubbornness were punjivadiharu Nepali Congress party called.
"
3911,"From the beginning of history, Communists, showing the participation of the 13 - year-old farmers from the farmer movement of the year -35 - 36 years of people's movement have been engaging for every problem of the people.
"
3912,"The Congress history has started with the power conspiracy - surrendered to the king of 033 years from the surrender to the name of Satyagraha, 042 years.
"
3913,"John - samarthanavinako Congress is not so overwhelmed by fraud the line 37 to accept the results announced by the referendum and not ?
"
3914,"Today, the Congress's poll results are blaming communist power.
"
3915,"In fact, the fact that the majority of the people won by the monarchy in the communal areas of the Communists - actually who made the victory victorious ?
"
3916,"Today, the CPN ( UML ) public has been presented by carrying the tradition of the CPI ( Maoist ) set up with the right purpose by carrying out a glorious history .
"
3917,"Congratulations !
"
3918,"People win the mind
"
3919,"Thirty years after the first parliamentary election has been completed after a long time.
"
3920,"Nepalis who were able to bow down the Darbar through the struggle of the Vaidani, were then tried to hunt different conspiracies.
"
3921,"But due to publicity, progressive arrangements have been issued in Nepal's history to date.
"
3922,"And after strengthening multi-party democracy, important role in parliamentary elections was completed.
"
3923,"Election results have selected leadership leadership for the next five years to operate the country's vigilance.
"
3924,"For the last 30 years, Nepalese people who were under the bridges of despair gave the vote to the party candidates party this time.
"
3925,"The parties come to the election - the announcement letters have already expressed opinions.
"
3926,"Developing policies have been resolved.
"
3927,"Now, in the next five years, the extent to which these things will be implemented will be related to Nepalese concerns.
"
3928,"The Government has completed the general election, with approval of the people's movement, and will transfer state-run operations to the elected government in some days.
"
3929,"The old government will break the old tradition, the success will be measured on that basis.
"
3930,"Considering the sign of the willingness shown by the Congress this time, the people have sent a large number of other parties to the house.
"
3931,"Now the . A . Pa . ( UML ) has come under the obligation to monitor the conglomerate of the Congress with other opposition parties in the shoulders.
"
3932,"The party has got the great harmony of the people and it should take an active initiative to fulfill the expectations of the people.
"
3933,"There is a need for the opposition to play an important role in democracy.
"
3934,"Opposition is also strong in the upcoming parliament, and the government is convinced that the opposition is guided by the government if it leaves the road.
"
3935,"The Opposition who is struggling to compete with the capable leaders can put an end to the upcoming government and speed up democracy's strength.
"
3936,"Healthy criticism can provide aided support to the government in the development of development, as soon as all elected representatives can join the country's nationalist day and night.
"
3937,"The best of all the victories !
"
3938,"New Government Get Success !
"
3939,"Within the next week, the new government will have gone to power.
"
3940,"Historic conventions have brought Nepali Congress to the government and the CPN ( UML ) has been given the responsibility to keep its maintenance.
"
3941,"In the future, two major political parties in Nepal can get rid of the problems of existing problems in the future.
"
3942,"But for those things, the residents living in the government should progressively move forward.
"
3943,"If the same process is used by the government, there is no basis for democracy to flourish.
"
3944,"CPN ( UML ) President and General Secretary , as seen as strong opposition, have made commitment to cooperate with the future government.
"
3945,""" I have to use all cooperation with the government "" said the GP Q . Koirala should not forget about the above mentioned matter.
"
3946,"I am optimistic that the CPI ( UML ) is also responsible persons , that they will also work in democratic dignity. '
"
3947,"Apparently that is to say - "" Lefts ' pharmidevala ' opposition as a statute that perhaps are no longer responsible ?""
"
3948,"There will be good to worry about fulfilling their obligations with responsibility.
"
3949,"All the Nepali people are convinced that the main opposition CPN ( UML ) will never make any obstacle in creative work.
"
3950,"The above mentioned matters should also be taken by the government residents.
"
3951,"A few days back, a statement from Girija Koirala was discussed in the market - "" I will bring Communists into a fine trek."" '
"
3952,"Communists are here to remember that the Cabinet rulers who want to bring them into the tracks they think they are going away.
"
3953,"Koirala, who is a ' anti communist image ' will make it even worse.
"
3954,"There will be something better to think about this.
"
3955,"Let us congratulate the Koirala, who is going to be prime minister in a historic mode of Nepal, and we wish to succeed in fulfilling our duties in a balanced manner.
"
3956,"The government is going on peace security
"
3957,"In Panchayat, there was also a question of peace security among the things that preached with power in a very important way.
"
3958,"Ever since the election, the workers of the political revolt have released the latest news that has hit some places in the country.
"
3959,"But now, is it that Koirala, who is in charge of the government, is it really serious to look after violence and terrorism ?
"
3960,"It's a matter of interest.
"
3961,"The capital has also arrived in the incidents of gangbangi in the country's disaster.
"
3962,"Common students did not participate in the democratic movement of eating foods beaten by campus in government conservation.
"
3963,"They were energized in the tide of the People's Movement, hoping that the nation would enter a new era and to solve their educational problems.
"
3964,"In the last election, which was highly important in the history of Nepal, youth - students actively participated in the election and helped to promote the chariot of democracy.
"
3965,"If democracy has been raised with wrong practices, it has a major impact on the fourth-round development of the country.
"
3966,"Manoj Joshi's murder has borne another Chinese physician
"
3967,"It is not improper to expect people to get relief and democratic dignity from the government after the restoration of democracy in the country.
"
3968,"The person who was like Girijabab, who performed a ransom for the victory of the People's Movement and King and Punch, is the same person today.
"
3969,"Some of the Nepali Congress Girija activity of self-breast crushed - crushed by it.
"
3970,"After the politics of Anita in the end, finally after the Girijababu came to kill the government, today the country has translated into the old style of panchayat.
"
3971,"When the Kisabbabu, who is taking the rise of people of Kohlpur and when Udaipur, finally, the question has been raised to push the country to foreign slogans.
"
3972,"Girijaabu murdered another warrior like Manoj Kumar Joshi, killing her warrior.
"
3973,"The public has reached the position of the government's tragedy and the blasts.
"
3974,"Churches demonstrate their work skills by conspiring movements to make the rivals stronger, respectively.
"
3975,"It seems that it is more likely to be surprising that Girijaabuibu, who is still using Julia Chang Valk's open political dowpch, is also more responsible than the maternal uncle.
"
3976,"Palace , police and army officials adhapeta mahangile touched to see the politics of eating it is called to do.
"
3977,"But the problem of working with Giribabaab's political spectrum is the bad habit of watching.
"
3978,"By spending millions panchayat "" Rohit hanging "" that has been a government conspiracy to rally full julusajastai unemployed.
"
3979,"Finally, Girijababu b . P . What are the symptoms of democratic socialism coming out of the mind, are those things appearing in the coming days.
"
3980,"But Giribabaab will be suitable for long power to walk relative to time.
"
3981,"Now, the public is not like 2047 years.
"
3982,"Everybody has been sitting at the place where they can be found , every one is tired of the bow of the bow.
"
3983,"National Crisis Crashes Do not Blow !
"
3984,"Even if the movement is being named in the name of the employee , the whole nation is invested by expensive , wastey , cloaky , bullets etc.
"
3985,"The National Crisis has emerged even after seeing only the streets of the capital left behind the other parts of the country.
"
3986,"Unlike Congress leaders who talk about ' emotionally ' in the house , they stand in favor of the work of the workers.
"
3987,"The government does not even go to the streets in any democratic country of the world against the movement.
"
3988,"Here at Panchayat, the Police Intelligence rulers did this.
"
3989,"Now the rulers have done it in the name of unemployed union.
"
3990,"We suggest that those who are in power should feel free to get rid of the lava under the place where they live.
"
3991,"The wrong person's selection , by . A . Unsuccessful
"
3992,"Recently, the political crisis generated in the country and the future for future results . INC . The government is completely responsible.
"
3993,"Since the Nepali Congress failed to handle the entire problem, it could be stumbled to not respect the mandate.
"
3994,"The . A . The misery of this country is linked with the disability or failure of the government , meaning that the two sides have doubled the future of Nepali.
"
3995,"But when the Nepali Congress government is elected to take over the authority of repression and suppression here, the choice of people of poor people is the key.
"
3996,"The Rushshoro Empire is also a little more intense for the infiltration policy.
"
3997,"Otherwise , why is hejoki mandated in Panchayati style , why is a strict suppression policy adopted by successful and successful opposition ?
"
3998,"A responsible political party can sometimes be considered step-by-step to leave gymnasiums for the country and the people.
"
3999,"Now , from today's circumstance, some elements will have to lose advantage.
"
4000,"From which democracy is afraid to lose.
"
4001,"So everyone knows the time and just go ahead.
"
4002,"State terror by Bourgeois leadership
"
4003,"Once again, the government has tied up the state terror by pushing it into the panchayat style.
"
4004,"The government giving discount facilities on luxury goods could not accommodate any discounted policy on goods consumed.
"
4005,"In this way, the current government is being led by the elite class.
"
4006,"The police force has not been able to misuse the police force by dumping it as a puppet in Isara, without listening to justified demands of the newly appointed workers.
"
4007,"This government, which is shot at the chest of the public, is abusing rights like punches.
"
4008,"By political appointments in the administrative units, especially the Natha ( Chamber ) of the Anarala family are insulting the festivals of the country.
"
4009,"It is clear from the fact that neither the Nepali Congress nor any other parliamentarians oppose it.
"
4010,"In the name of multi-party democracy, the Nepali Congress, which is openly opposed to open-party colonialism, is trying to mislead the people in the slogan of socialism.
"
4011,"As a result of power in the state, due to the non-democratic activities of the present government, the country has once again been wrapped up with reinforcement.
"
4012,"Every conscious class has been under the leadership of the Nepali Congress against every activity that has been deported to the mandate.
"
4013,"The staff are doing what is right
"
4014,"After the emergence of democracy, the same employee had an agreement to open the organization.
"
4015,"However , that agreement itself broke out by Nepali Congress and began to open the alleged civil servants association.
"
4016,"The steps that have been taken in accordance with antitrust behavior.
"
4017,"The Nepali Congress also did the work of two polarization of a purely organization of employees.
"
4018,"By fact, the realistic fact that the employee's organization is a welcome step to demand the dismissal of the alleged employees of the organization, can never be dismissed.
"
4019,"Justify the Nepali Congress to split the same staff ?
"
4020,"What democracy do you frown and rule ?
"
4021,"If not, why is the illegitimate son of the Employee Association ?
"
4022,"And to give validity ?
"

"
4630,"Giri heard the words of God, lamented by the Brahma and abandoned the spirit of disorder and abandoned the desire created on the body.
"

"
4637,"Then the master Creator began to scoff the full glory of the world.

"
4639,"Then the brilliance of a brilliant woman, which was also called Achikini, became herd in the womb.
"
4640,"She was very happy with birth, and kept her name Sati.
"
4641,"Sati Devi Balakal was admitted to herbal age and had become beautiful to surround the mind.
"
4642,"He always wanted to get God Shambu.
"
4643,"Received the Satheedevi Shankar Brahma and Vishnu come at a time when a day - his woman Savitri and came laksmikasatha sambhukaham.
"

"
4649,"So is the woman who is always following my actions ?
"
4650,"Tell me
"
4651,"Then Brahma said - Sapti, a charming daughter-in-law, is the kind of nature you have said, and she is letting you get her husband as a husband.
"
4652,"Then the sculpture promised to happen so.
"
4653,"In the months of this month, the worship fasting of Sati was in progress.

"
4661,"Even as the skillful person was listening to all the words from Sati's mouth, how could Shambhu be given Satyevi?

4662,"I er skilled Brahma said - what I want to do what I had done and munivaraharule mirage more work was to be perfect.
"
4663,"Shambhu liked Sati Devi to marry.
"
4664,"That's why ! Give your daughter Sati Shambhu to Sati's fast and Shambhu's wish.
"
4665,"By this your krtakrtyata (success) is.
"
4666,"Approved that the skill is also available.
"

"
4669,"It is a good idea to hear about this . How are my daughter Sethidhi eligible for you ?
"
4670,"Vishnu will also cross this work.
"
4671,"I was shifted to the skill of the skull.
"
4672,"Asked why Vishnu was honored by the competent Prachanda.
"
4673,"Vishnu came to ask for something , more efficiently than ever before - if you asked for anything.
"
4674,"Then Vishnu said that the woman of Sethi Devi was kind to me.
"
4675,"Yes , take a break in the morning.
"
4676,"And the Vishnu said that there will always be doubt - I feel like I had to go.
"
4677,"But ask me for it.
"
4678,"You can ask for a petition to give birth to the elderly saint.
"
4679,"When a skilled creature gives a conjunction, her eyes will be trimmed in your hand.
"
4680,"Thereafter, on the occasion of birth of Vishnu, Vishnu went to Shakti Prapati's house.
"
4681,"The skilled creature was prepared to prepare for the wedding and make sure that all the material was prepared.
"
4682,"At the same time, Shankar stood up and took a skilled house and asked for Bhiksha.
"
4683,"Then the devotee of Vishnu ! It took me time to pass, giving bhaisaknebittikai looking for solace, now where I just did that.
"
4684,"Then daksaki viranile woman giving gold kamandalule section, capable of Vishnu's hands to entrust Prajapati was Satheedevi.
"
4685,"At this time, Vishnu handed over the hand of Sethi Devi's eye-eyed eye-bearer to the hand of a sinner.
"
4686,"He viewed with great sadness skilled Prajapati and Vishnu - You hypocrite, my heart, my daughter Satheedevi when your faith in this case, said Angel.
"
4687,"Vishnu passed away from some north river that I will go.
"
4688,"Sathi Devi , who is the sister of the sisters who got the masters from God , did not cry loudly.
"
4689,"Again, I wrote in my work , that my master is patient.
"
4690,"On the way, the Shankar talked about a woman with a saint and reached her place in Kailash mountain.
"
4691,"Sati Devi saw the house of her father remembering her father's house.
"
4692,"Again, in my work, I was grateful that the inner bush was cleaned inside.
"
4693,"When the owner woke up, seeing that there was something to be worn, Swami was sitting in a sleeping room without seeing anything.
"
4694,"What did you eat
"
4695,"The satidevile smiling face, spoke up - makes a great sleep jagaina liked.
"
4696,"What if I eat the sweets that I have stored in the store , what will you eat ?
"
4697,"Satidevile of the house to watch every activities, again made on who will give beyond making said.
"
4698,"Then the suspect picked up the wall of the Kharti, giving Satiti goddess to Kailash as well as his statue of the world.
"
4699,"Then Sati Devi blessed the heart and tears of joy from the eyes, I am amazed, that I will find the Bhagvana Shankar Mahadev Swami, scolding the suspect.
"
4700,"In this way, doubts - two types of descriptions appear to be different from each other regarding sleep marriage.
"
4701,"However, even though Shankar and Sati's marriage are from any event, it is clear that the father of Prati Papati, does not like the person's doubts.
"
4702,"What is apparent about the description of other incidents, such as meeting meetings and skeptics in Prayagraj.
"
4703,"Earlier here, a summary of the description of Shankar Rudra Jimmatkutu Huna is given.
"
4704,"The reason for Shankar Jimutkutu huaa
"
4705,"Even though the suspect and Sati came to Kailash, there was no such house as a skepticist.
"
4706,"Because of the reason he was an unbelievable man, his mind was unconcerned in earthquake.
"
4707,"So he was living in a simple house, which was likely to deteriorate water and wind during the rainy season.
"
4708,"He also spent time in the Himalayas , Kashi, and places apart from Kailash .
"
4709,"There was no good home in those places.
"
4710,"Saditvi's daughter-in-law, like a skilled creature, was lacking in her slow home.
"
4711,"This topic is discussed in the description of Shiva Puran Rudra Sanghata , Sati section and description of the festival of Sati, which is as follows :
"
4712,"At the time of staying at the peak of Kailash in the rainy season one time, Sethevi is the hero . Rainfall has arrived.
"
4713,"At this time cork and Mayor make their bulls, but how does the house live without merely ?
"
4714,"I'm scared.
"
4715,"Therefore, place the house , Kailash , Himalayas , Kashi, or any part of the earth , where there is a need for the house.
"
4716,"There is no cloud in Sumaru's peak.
"
4717,"Say what you want to live on these mountains.
"
4718,"Listen to the doubt, Sati said that she would like to live in the Himalayas.
"
4719,"Then the champion took Sati to the top of the Himalayas, and remained there for a long time.
"
4720,"While living there, they used to travel from other places to the other places and occasionally travel even when they traveled to other parts of the earth.
"
4721,"Such doubts and sages passed in joy.
"
4722,"Markandey said - Father !

4723,"In this world , what is the most important element of protecting all kinds of humans in the universe , and tell me that no one has yet been told.

"
5063,"God ?
"
5064,"There is probably no person in the world with God's Word incomplete , but humans are still ignorant by the real introduction or real knowledge of the divine.
"
5065,"Similarly, the existence of the world official in the world is also mandatory.
"
5066,"But does all humans in this world know that world officer and the God of God ?
"
5067,"Add as a light bulb or power yoga reality means - gharasanga not, when the light and power of the media can be.
"
5068,"Still, the "" knowledge of the divine "", its satisfying and true knowledge could not be ascertained, and so far it has remained.
"
5069,"If there is a god with the masses ? If the question is asked, it is the answer that it is a power.
"
5070,"Power is really the virtue of the divine and it is not possible to have the existence of ""the creature "" to possess qualities and qualities .
"
5071,"Such as perfume and sweetness etc. is something special.
"
5072,"The form of the divine
"
5073,"No object can be seen from a macro-eye but it can not be done , and there is no form of existence .
"
5074,"This is not the same as the divine.
"
5075,"It is a form of divine and uncontrollable power.
"
5076,"But it is divine and impeccable because it can be seen by divine moon.
"
5077,"The meaning of rejection of God means that it does not have any form.
"
5078,"In reality , the word 'reflex' is relative , that is , compared to the physical form of other spirits.
"
5079,"Other souls consider macro or micro bodies , but the divine is different from the birth of the dead.
"
5080,"The spirit that is considered to be fascinating is called the truth.
"
5081,"The soul which has given a micro perception can be called a microscopic god or a deity god.
"
5082,"The divine has neither his own body nor a subtle body , so he is called a despair.
"
5083,"So formless means - akaya , latent , non-physical.
"
5084,"God is not different from nature, but its form is different from others.
"
5085,"The divine form of the divine "" light point "" means that the size of the light is like.
"
5086,"The name of the divine
"
5087,"All the devoted men in the world are named by the body.
"
5088,"After the present body assumed that i.e., after the present birth, the name of which he had named was not often the same name in the previous birth.
"
5089,"Instead , Brahmins , parents , or any other Mahatma put the name of Kodododoro.
"
5090,"As soon as the body changes, the name of the man is again resurrected.
"
5091,"It is clear that the name of all men is destruction and is in the body.
"
5092,"But if the divine is immortal and do not come to an end of the monsoon, then their name is unchangeable and unrealistic.
"
5093,"That is why it is true to say that ' God ' is separated from the name.
"
5094,"Yes , it can be said that the name of God is separated.
"
5095,"His divine name is - Shiva.
"
5096,"Shiva means - 1 ) Welfare 2 ) seed form 3 ) point.
"
5097,"Because the divine is the Savior of all the creatures.
"
5098,"So he is a welfare.
"
5099,"The seed is the same as a creator God Shiva also srsti trees - tuning brksakonimitta is due.
"
5100,"Because the divine form of light is the same.
"
5101,"So Shiva's name is absolutely real.
"
5102,"Shivling of the Memorial of God
"
5103,"Their memorable symbols , statues, and temples are made to remember all the great things .
"
5104,"But most of the idols in the world are likely to worship Shivling.
"
5105,"Maybe there is a country in the world where Shivling is not worshiped.
"
5106,"Shiva's meaningful meaning is the welfare of the divine and the meaning of gender is the statue.
"
5107,"Therefore, Shivaling means the statue of the welfare of the God of the welfare.
"
5108,"In the ancient times the Shivalling diamonds ( which are lightly visible in natural form ) were created because the form of the divine is the light point.
"
5109,"Shivaling was established in the famous temple of Somnath, the world's best diamond cohort was founded.
"
5110,"In different religions, the divine is also recognized in this size.
"
5111,"Shiva's 12 most famous monasteries in India are also known as the Jyotingham monastery.
"
5112,"It is also very popular in the Himalayas, Kedareshwar Ling Malwama Visheshwar and Somnath in Saurashtra Pradesh and Mahakaleshwar are very famous in Ujjain of Madhya Pradesh.
"
5113,"Outside India, other volunteers who differ from Hinduism in close and far-off countries are also giving great respect to Shivaling's statue.
"
5114,"For example, in Roman countries, the Roman Catholics of the Christian religion still worship this type of elliptical stone.
"
5115,"When the Israelites and the Jews eat a variety of stones, they touch such a stone according to their customs.
"
5116,"Shri Ram Chandrajee, in Rameshwar , has been seen by Lord Krishna in Guptaeshwar and other gods also worshiping his ultimate God - Shiva.
"
5117,"Confusion about Shiva
"
5118,"The difference between divine and spirit
"
5119,"But the ultimate word is not qualitative but the result is a speech.
"
5120,"Instead, his qualities and duty will be great or superior.
"
5121,"How can the souls of the divine beings become infinite and indefinite, when the existence of both the souls and the consciousness of divine powers ?
"
5122,"Therefore, there is a different power to divine divine souls.
"
5123,"The divine is one and the souls are many.
"
5124,"The divine is used as a word but the spirits plural , such as souls , saints , gods, but divine never say.
"
5125,"So the divine is one, and other souls can never say to themselves.
"
5126,"Forgetting yourself to be Shiva or to say Shivoham or Ahm Brahmami.
"
5127,"Often it seems that Shivaling is worshiped as the same but small stones of Shalegram.
"
5128,"As Shivaling is the sign of the divine Shiva, Shaligram is a sign of different souls.
"
5129,"Although there is a difference in the qualities and values ​​of many souls and religions, but the appearance and shape of all are similar to the same light.
"
5130,"Shivling is shown only in the statues to reveal the ultimate power of the divine than Shalagram.
"
5131,"The souls come to the end of the death of the dead , meaning that they take revenge , but at the end of the fiction in the divine power of God , there is only a divine and supernatural paradise.
"
5132,"The souls remain holy in the sunlight, and afterward fall, but the deity of the divine is the divine forever - ever.
"
5133,"The duty of God and composition of the Trinity
"
5134,"The duty is to show the glory or greatness of anyone.
"
5135,"Since the divine divine Shiva is the father of all the riches, his divine and welfare duty is also for all the world.
"
5136,"Generally ask someone to ask that what does God do ?
"
5137,"Many people answer that all the work of the world is happening in the power of the divine.
"
5138,"Because of all deeds, the divine is the form and can not lighten one leaves without obeying it.
"
5139,"But it is a little bit hard to think about the fact that there are two good things in the world.
"
5140,"The bad work of evil deeds is painful.
"
5141,"Does the divine do evil even if others get hurt ?
"
5142,"Just like a man comes in a impulse and knocks on another man, does it also be the worker of the violent act ?
"
5143,"If the divine is always called sad person, then his karma can never be in pain.
"
5144,"If sin - Karma or Punya Karma paramatmale said the note, why suffer the spirits good or bad fruit ?
"
5145,"When it is said by the law, he does what he does.
"
5146,"This is not a duty to God.
"
5147,"Being born , living and dead is also based on his actions.
"
5148,"This finite and God is a - a manisakalagi no personal karma.
"
5149,"Their actions are uniform and infinite.
"
5150,"It is also said that he is a fallen wind.
"
5151,"To accomplish this purpose, he needs to do three supernatural work.
"
5152,"1 . Establishment of truth , holiness and peace by knowledge
"
5153,"2 . Destruction , Exodus and Destruction of Absolutely
"
5154,"3 . Religion - Mercy , the follow-up of holy spirit and its growth
"
5155,"Therefore, the divine Shiva is called Trimti.
"
5156,"There are many evidence of the scriptures.
"
5157,"1 . The three lines of the trumpet that is mounted in Shivling, indicates Shiva's trinity.
"
5158,"2 . The Beltriver which is offered on Shiva is three layers of it.
"
5159,"From this also, Shiva knows that there is a Trinity.
"
5160,"Buddha's personality and ideology
"
5161,"That is why he has published only the remedy for suffering and suffering.
"
5162,"Buddha repeatedly states that his teachings are based on four eternal truths.
"
5163,"Sad : b up to the end of the most (extreme) on not to , middle omniscience.
"
5164,"It is clear that Buddha had instructed the need for morality , personal effort, and discreet intelligence to be free of suffering.
"
5165,"This sermon is often divided into shrine , tomb, and primarily.
"
5166,"Sila ( morality ) and intelligence ( Buddhi ) of this blend Buddha - religion is originality.
"
5167,"In general philosophical principles of the Buddha three points - transient , pain , ego - from the familiar note.
"
5168,"All the world is transient ( variable ) are , perpetual inventory is not that ( anatma ) and Genesis is so sad.
"
5169,"For example, somebody might have liked a pen.
"
5170,"As a result, divorced is incredible.
"
5171,"Therefore, the desire to engage in any content is sad.
"
5172,"The organism is therefore the name of the name and the form.
"
5173,"Name ( mind ) also has persecution , noun , ritual and science ( consciousness ) .
"
5174,"Both names ( minds ) and forms ( physical objects ) are unique ; Moments are changing moments.
"
5175,"This continuity punarbhava ( reincarnation ) is.
"
5176,"But this transientism is very quick because we look directly at any subject or object and believe it.
"
5177,"It is true, though prajnapti (Relative Reality) is.
"
5178,"Buddha is called Maharaknik because he would have compassion on all.
"
5179,"He left the family and family for the human society , and even after Buddha was born for the sake of life , he also taught the place place Chihari for 45 years.
"
5180,"He was opposed to hardcore violence.
"
5181,"He was a pioneer of peace.
"
5182,"But he was always opposed to injustice, to stay right or to be exploited.
"
5183,""" Non-paramodharma ' At that time the Buddha - religion is not.
"
5184,"He was very hard.
"
5185,""" Uninspired yoked together , work yourself "" that is his original teaching.
"
5186,"He used to rush the alcoholic monks again.
"
5187,"No work hard to be successful , wisdom ( intelligence ) and destiny ( karma ) to require that it was his idea.
"
5188,"Pride ( which themselves damjincha others ) of almost all opposition , the Buddha also , have.
"
5189,"He lived for the society.
"
5190,"Self-promotion did not like him.
"
5191,"He was very opponent of worship and idol worship.
"
5192,"He would have told him to see his teachings.
"
5193,"He had to give the gift given to him by giving him the union.
"
5194,"Such person was his.
"
5195,"In Buddha and Scholar, Buddha was unique.
"
5196,"The importance of praise was very little to understand.
"
5197,"Whatever he wanted, he could have understood the use of his word.
"
5198,"So Buddha is also called omnipresent.
"
5199,"But it is not believed that the ancient Buddha - religion is believed that everyone can always have knowledge of the knowledge of everything at all times.
"
5200,"But Buddha was not interested in wisdom - luxury.
"
5201,"Unnecessary argument was not his interest in debate and debate.
"
5202,"The philosophical thinking of the world, when did the creation of the world , did not seem to heal.
"
5203,"Buddha's contribution to patient service is incomplete.
"
5204,"He had encouraged the current medicine and his use method very much.
"
5205,"He gave some orders made to monks that they should not be applied to the drug.
"
5206,"Buddhists are worshiped as a master teacher as the greatest physician of history.
"
5207,"Buddha used to be patient with his own hands.
"
5208,"He would say , "" Whoever serves the patient , he serves Buddha ""!
"
5209,"Although Buddha never showed politics in a serious interest , he was also clear about how the state should be used.
"
5210,"He was anti-dictator.
"
5211,"He believed that it was credible for us to use state by communal decisions.
"
5212,"Frequently asked people qualified in the administration should be appreciated.
"
5213,"He was an opponent of the infiltration.
"
5214,"Buddha was clear about economic policy.
"
5215,"He said that social criminals continue to remain unemployed.
"
5216,"Business policies are found in his teachings that merchants invest in half of their profits in business , the tax system is easier to fit , tax system easier.
"
5217,"Personally Buddha was very attractive.
"
5218,"He is considered to have a male with 32 symptoms.
"
5219,"At that time, the Brahmin scholars used to backward to see that his body is not of those signs.
"
5220,"The person who had always been stupid to his most attractive face was monks.
"
5221,"Sujata saw her personality as a god.
"
5222,"Even Brahma, when Brahmana of Mandandi, offered the proposal to marry Buddha to marry her daughter.
"
5223,"It is clear that Buddha was the most attractive personality person.
"
5224,"Buddha's voice is of special importance.
"
5225,"Buddha's words are praised in Buddhist literature.
"
5226,"It seems from literature that Buddha's voice was very serious but effective.
"
5227,"People listened to his voice.
"
5228,"The way his teaching was different from different people.
"
5229,"The wonderful ability to understand the audience's psychology was in Buddha and according to the audience he would preach.
"
5230,"But he often preferred to preach in the style of questionnaire and dialogue.
"
5231,"Buddha is teaching the financial policy
"
5232,"The language was considered to be the medium of communication.
"
5233,"He was not a fanist for the speech.
"
5234,"In the language that the audience can learn more, he used to use the same language.
"
5235,"Buddha was an advocate.
"
5236,"All the subjects of the world are ( reasons ) for things and therefore everything is eternal , changeable , and moments are changing momentarily.
"
5237,"It is so powerful that he was his anityavada a continual , immortal , immortal , aparivartana also acknowledge the existence of the spirit with her.
"
5238,"Buddha was a culprit.
"
5239,"No community does not consider eternal and immortal souls in Buddhism.
"
5240,"Buddha did not even consider the Creator of the world or the supreme God as a great reason for every subject matter.
"
5241,"Buddha was a godmother.
"
5242,"He did not consider any god of God as the Creator , the Creator , or the Creator .
"
5243,"The great God's concept that God created by the world, the God, which was run by the world , was not acceptable to him.
"
5244,"But he was not even materialistic.
"
5245,"Mind ( mind ) to understand the importance he would.
"
5246,"He used to distinguish himself in ignorance and ignorance.
"
5247,"He used to believe that when he was working or had mental health in life.
"
5248,"Buddha was a neutralist.
"
5249,"According to the Buddha's favor, the good fruitage of good works and the bad consequences of bad deeds come out.
"
5250,"Buddha was a workman.
"
5251,"Karma believed in the fruit.
"
5252,"Perhaps the most important attribute of Buddha is his humanist theory.
"
5253,"Due to humanism, Buddha can be separated from other religious leaders or leaders. Buddha's humanist ideology can be divided into society - based and person - based ideology.
"
5254,"The medium routes that may be suffering from Buddha's rendering can also be divided into two directions.
"
5255,"His message is that by sitting in society , the society itself is suffering from personal practice.
"
5256,"Buddha was the understanding of the importance of society , so it is wonderful.
"
5257,"Free of pain , nirvana can get , right in need of social life, he would have ended.
"
5258,"Where religion was established for the establishment of the Monk Sangh, on the other hand, it also presented the model of an ideal society.
"
5259,"Monk is not integral to the Sangh society , it is a part of society.
"
5260,"Households are busy in society and do not have enough time to study.
"
5261,"The monk union completes the work of study because the monks do not have the burden of the home.
"
5262,"Monks Association teaches the education received from the study.
"
5263,"Monks Association bread instead of society , so that she gets the monks food and freed so that they can study.
"
5264,"The Buddha wanted the Sangh and monk union to become one another.
"
5265,"Buddha repeatedly warned those who were monks for comfort and convenience , "" Monks !
"
5266,"Do not forget that you are eating Nations bodies , society are eating food.
"
5267,"Do not distract from your duty. ""
"
5268,"Buddha was very cautious that the monsoon association would not only be a gathering of doodles and greedies.
"
5269,"Buddha was also cautious for the monsoon association not to get rid of the society.
"
5270,"Buddhists were revolutionary revolutionaries.
"
5271,"It is worth studying Buddha's views about the importance of society and the role of monk Sangh.
"
5272,"Monks do not have monks in their association.
"
5273,"Every monkey collects everything except his own cheek and some personal stuff.
"
5274,"Those who are older are considered as monk.
"
5275,"A monk must strive for the spiritual advancement of the monks union , that the society must approach.
"
5276,"It is worth mentioning that the monk has not been deprived of caring for his parents, even after being abandoned from his house.
"
5277,"For the caste equality, the Buddha is well-versed.
"
5278,"Buddha's ideology is also remarkable about the role of women in society.
"
5279,"He taught the King the king that men were not in any area behind the men's side.
"
5280,"He opposed the superstitions of society in the society.
"
5281,"He was the opponent of slave law.
"
5282,"When he got the opportunity , he freed the slaves.
"
5283,"But perhaps in the immediate society, slaves did not want to be free themselves, because they were unable to live after they were released from slavery.
"
5284,"The person is based on the end of the humanist side of the Buddha, because the author believes that this is the highest quality of Buddha.
"
5285,"The study of human history shows that people are living in intellectual slavery.
"
5286,"They are considered by God.
"
5287,"God is considered to be less than gods.
"
5288,"The religious leaders have been exploiting intellectuals.
"
5289,"Leaders have been exploiting intellectuals.
"
5290,"There is a historical man Buddha who gives the highest priority to the person , to be the highest creature , the highest priority to man's discreet intelligence.
"
5291,"In fact Buddha had revolutionized intellectual exploitation.
"
5292,"Legends like Buddha, who raise awareness of the power of man, have not yet been in the history of human society.
"
5293,"The Buddha is the one who preachs like that.
"
5294,"Someone, in spite of reading , did not believe in eye shouting, was the Buddha fan of human wisdom to use his intelligence.
"
5295,"Buddha had given great recognition to the independent thought.
"
5296,"Buddha - Because religion is written in any scriptures, it does not mean proof, and in this sense it is different than most of the other common religions.
"
5297,"Buddha did not accept the existence of God , but ancient Buddha - religion is found to be the existence of God.
"
5298,"But they consider the deity more than God !
"
5299,"Even Buddhists believe that the principles revered by the Buddha to the highest degree of humanity.
"
5300,"In order to suffer sadness, the teachings of Buddha should be done as well as the personal industry as well.
"
5301,"In essence, there are sermons of pure society - based and tantrums and intellect - based Buddhists.
"
5302,"The relative role of society and the person was clear to Buddha.
"
5303,"Always being an impartial , always the last sermon of Buddha to live consciously.
"
5304,"How should the body be described , how it is created ?
"
5305,"Because we all are created and are also creating.
"
5306,"How are the creation and how are we created ?
"
5307,"Who does not know this and in human beings ?
"
5308,"But neither did anyone know anything about creation nor did anyone know what he had received.
"
5309,"Some of the humans have discussed the creation of the creation , the meaning of creation has opened.
"
5310,"Have you seen the association of Creation and many things, but what are you saying ?
"
5311,"Whatever the eyes of the human beings are seen , are enjoying and creating , what is known for such an easy creation and what happens when it comes to life.
"
5312,"This mystery thing describes the creation as a matter of description and description.
"
5313,"There are even women and men , sex is , conceives and is created.
"
5314,"The thing is, and ?
"
5315,"What we are doing
"
5316,"What about such a common thing ?
"
5317,"Of course , what secret !
"
5318,"What is the secret ?
"
5319,"How is creation ?
"
5320,"Who has created here here ?
"
5321,"Where could you have been so imagined in imagination ?
"
5322,"How beautiful people are born.
"
5323,"Can those people with such beautifully illustrated idols be able to create a car ?
"
5324,"All were normal
"
5325,"In general work, there is unusual work.
"
5326,"What kind of childhood parents are born?
"
5327,"Neither is born to know nor to be born.
"
5328,"What does it mean to know what is wrong ?
"
5329,"So far, would you have a son or who knows the daughter ?
"
5330,"And who has created ?
"
5331,"Of course , the creation has been from the parent, and we have also taken the body from our parents.
"
5332,"That's true
"
5333,"Here too many wise ones argue that what is the option of creation ?
"
5334,"Which Mathuni left behind creation?
"
5335,"As such, in the tent of our ancient temple, pictures of sexual intercourse should be well-dressed in a very good manner.
"
5336,"In this temple and temple every temple can be found in the temple of every Shivapravati and Goddess.
"
5337,"Whether in the temple of Pashupatinath or at any temple in Bhagwati Devi.
"
5338,"Kalkakla is found to be surrounded by outside Vishwasup and Hanuman Dock.
"
5339,"It seems that the nature and creation of the universe should be shown.
"
5340,"It is created in shame and is shameful in creation.
"
5341,"To say shame is to be created mysteriously.
"
5342,"Who did not create from here to ketching to man ?
"
5343,"By producing seeds and seeds , they are involved in the creation till the vegetation , leaving the human beings completely.
"
5344,"This is our voice, especially for humans.
"
5345,"Complete the same for others , given to others !
"
5346,"If you do not manusyakalagi , this is bhannupardaicha.
"
5347,"Now the body remains.
"
5348,"The body is ?
"
5349,"How is it ?
"
5350,"What are the factors ?
"
5351,"What are in the body ?
"
5352,"How is the body composed, and how does the life in the body run ?
"
5353,"It seems that body is inside the world.
"
5354,"If there is a world inside the body, knowledge and science are the interpretations of this , there is nothing else.
"
5355,"The world is the body , the body is life , your secret is the soul , atmabhitra are divine.
"
5356,"What else is there ?
"
5357,"Here's the question that we have seen and seen in this world , yes.
"
5358,"Knowing knowledge
"
5359,"Who knows who ?
"
5360,"Know yourself , get yourself to know.
"
5361,"Knowing that knowledge science.
"
5362,"If you are interested in identifying it and identifying it, then it will be a vegetable.
"
5363,"Because the world has spoken to us.
"
5364,"Is it easy for Bhavasagar ?
"
5365,"Here's what is more difficult and easier than that, which makes it easier.
"
5366,"I hate hatred.
"
5367,"Being fascinated only loses love for others.
"
5368,"Creation is easy to create creations for creation.
"
5369,"Which is like today's world.
"
5370,"Creation is rebellion.
"
5371,"Such a precious human life today has been adopted to form a family planning method.
"
5372,"There is opposition in creation.
"
5373,"Love is the love of love with love.
"
5374,"It is necessary to understand what the law is about, rather than being confused with conflict.
"
5375,"In human beings, there is a significance of cosmicity.
"
5376,"What is the celibacy ?
"
5377,"Brahmacharya is the conduct of the universe.
"
5378,"Creation of the universe was created by Brahma.
"
5379,"Creation is more than what is created , to create or create something.
"
5380,"What are our brethren born ?
"
5381,"Fearing from being born to humans, life remains unmarried by life.
"
5382,"If a woman is unmarried, she does not meet a man and if he is a man, then with a woman.
"
5383,"The special relationship stritattva or woman to do , means to guard against the creation.
"
5384,"How did the divine escape from creation ?
"
5385,"Creation was not created , walked against the law of creation.
"
5386,"The method or style of the opposite of the nature of the creation or the nature will be called Brahmacharya, whether it is also the poets of the poets.
"
5387,"This can happen , there is a difference between the universe and the universe.
"
5388,"The universe is above creation.
"
5389,"Brahma's work should be the universe, but the universe must operate the universe.
"
5390,"In this sense, the meaning of Brahmacharya can be found.
"
5391,"What is Brahmacharias ?
"
5392,"I do not understand
"
5393,"The brahmacharya also has the body , touches and shifts from the hair or the hairdresser.
"
5394,"There are many things of the Creator's Household and the Believers.
"
5395,"Lifestyle style is just one of the most interesting tasks.
"
5396,"Looking for a simple meaning does not mean Brahmacharya means the meaning of Brahmacharya.
"
5397,"But this does not seem to be the same and can not be used in the universe's creation.
"
5398,"To protect yourself from the burden of self creation, it has become universal to understand the rule of supernatural universe that it means some sense.
"
5399,"Love is in life , life is in love.
"
5400,"The relationship between love and life is very closely related to love.
"
5401,"Without creation, creation is zero.
"
5402,"Love is created by mutual love , creation of love is created by creation of love.
"
5403,"There is a body inside love , the body is love.
"
5404,"After attaining love, neither the policy of love can be understood nor provides the opportunity to understand the love of others.
"
5405,"In this paradise body there is another element of mutual discrimination.
"
5406,"Do not explain to us that our saint Mahant has described a lot of our eastern philosophy.
"
5407,"We just left to understand.
"
5408,"How much do I describe ?
"
5409,"That too can not figure out that.
"
5410,"Again, I guess what the body does not like.
"
5411,"When people walked two feet, people needed to think that how could I be able to fight and walk ?
"
5412,"People say - there are two layers or bodies to look at the body, another physical angle.
"
5413,"Whether these angles need to be explained or not, today they need to ask the wise.
"
5414,"The thing to be understood is that it is difficult to put into anxiety that there is a soul inside the body , as a soul itself is the body.
"
5415,"As a tan
"
5416,"There are layers of the beads.
"
5417,"Mind , intellect , mind , ego , conscience are vrttiharu.
"
5418,"Why do we know these things ?
"
5419,"We are , what are we ?
"
5420,"Have we walked with the body , without the body ?
"
5421,"If all the body is there, why do we get into this joke ?
"
5422,"The world is fair.
"
5423,"There is a game in the fair.
"
5424,"Understanding this is the world as a game of life.
"
5425,"As games, it is like playing games rather than the rules of the game.
"
5426,"Can it be said that the image of the entire game description of the game already ?
"
5427,"It seems that the sweetness of the game is broken.
"
5428,"Being proud of the ignorance of the ignorance can be the glory of the game , as today's life cycle is operated.
"
5429,"The game is worn in that game.
"
5430,"If this body was neither before nor during the period, then do you forget here ?
"
5431,"Have you ever been aware of the rule of the Divine Law ?
"
5432,"I just need to talk only a little bit.
"
5433,"Because our age is short.
"
5434,"How much can you understand ?
"
5435,"It has not been understood to its own body , what to do most ?
"
5436,"Looking for a lot can be unhappy.
"
5437,"People say - there are many things to know in the world.
"
5438,"If so, what do people know ?
"
5439,"If one thing is well-known, the way to know more is open.
"
5440,"The formula looks for the formula.
"
5441,"Why are not the shaded diamond necklaces , all the gems are scattered if the formula is removed.
"
5442,"Is body a body of body ?
"
5443,"Everything must have been the body.
"
5444,"There are organs inside the body.
"
5445,"Which we have
"
5446,"I do not say that there are such ancestors in the body.
"
5447,"Physicians have created pictures of each human body and decorated in their work room.
"
5448,"The doctors are not even saying that the body is more than decorated.
"
5449,"Then what ?
"
5450,"A child thinks what this is when driving a car to a car mechanic.
"
5451,"The mechanic said that the father is ' engine ' .
"
5452,"What is the engine ?
"
5453,"The engine is the one who carries or carries a factory factory.
"
5454,"What is the factory ?
"
5455,"The factory is that which makes the raw material work harder for a pale.
"
5456,"What is raw material now ?
"
5457,"The raw materials are those that are found naturally or naturally.
"
5458,"What is the natural form now ?
"
5459,"The natural form is that when you walk , you see trees , leaves , animals , stones , soil , fruit.
"
5460,"Now how can the engineer or mechanism explain that this is what it means !
"
5461,"It takes time to remember.
"
5462,"The child starts stirring down , and starts crying .
"
5463,"That time, they show them great engine.
"
5464,"The boy is stuck after seeing the engine itself gone ; Again, say - how does it go , from where ?
"
5465,"It goes on
"
5466,"Say it not to run or rotate it ?
"
5467,"Inside the engine
"
5468,"The boy started saying that open and show me what is in here ?
"
5469,"Seeing the child's curiosity, they start opening the engine.
"
5470,"The child puts the engine of the engine in hand and says what it means - nut bolts.
"
5471,"This is the same sequence of piston , vending , brake , cassette , oilcill , pump or carburetor or engineer pump.
"
5472,"Now it says that after showing open this engine runs from.
"
5473,"What is the engine run ?
"
5474,"Now the engine does not say that answer, but by doing all this.
"
5475,"The child understands something, but the effect of curiosity remains in effect.
"
5476,"This is the trend in us.
"
5477,"We have not left the child's perception.
"
5478,"There is usually no need to get rid of the childhood of that idea.
"
5479,"The auto-generated body is to be created as a master, engineer and scientist.
"
5480,"The principle is based on a large extent.
"
5481,"Fight should be the body of the body.
"
5482,"A body is a body to another body is telling you to see another mardaicha , maramara tonight.
"
5483,"What is this ?
"
5484,"No physical miracles ?
"
5485,"There is a worldly process that is the bodybuilding , expansion and end.
"
5486,"From ancular monetary to human, and indigenously, it is body to the elephant.
"
5487,"Why such a difference, but not the body of a boy, everyone - his own existence.
"
5488,"Within this existence the body has its own power.
"
5489,"The body is a group.
"
5490,"It can be dominated only when it stays tight.
"
5491,"No death
"
5492,"It is physical to say that there is a discrepancy discipline, regardless of why.
"
5493,"The woman - the man with the distinction between the physical properties of elements are said.
"
5494,"From enemy friends to the whole world, it is also physical.
"
5495,"This is the feeling of intimacy that the body can confirm.
"
5496,"Did the person understand the creation of the body, which can not be understood by the body inside the body, keeping the body under the body ?
"
5497,"It is the way to eliminate eyelashes.
"
5498,"That is exactly what the world must have enjoyed.
"
5499,"The flower is the law to be fruitful.
"
5500,"The beginning of creation is believed to be started from Hiranyagabh.
"
5501,"Seeing so much discrimination with the body of the body, even a whole association has environmentalized everyone.
"
5502,"This means that the original element has taken all because all the body is age.
"
5503,"There is a definite standard of age.
"
5504,"This means that ultimate reality has been given here.
"
5505,"Unless you know the destiny of the Almighty, your destiny is not understood.
"
5506,"Participating with the policy is the order to run and fate or stick.
"
5507,"No one knows it.
"
5508,"This did not know life , means of life key to another hand operation, even when the husband ' s pride, we are able to carry.
"
5509,"The key to carrying the key is the rhythm of our body , the victim will suffer .
"
5510,"Hunting also means eating one another's body.
"
5511,"It is wonderful that in the world the ' life of living creatures ,' is a mantra.
"
5512,"The order means the world to eat - to eat means that the world food production obey the object.
"
5513,"Production means creation.
"
5514,"HOW creation Creation is the body , the body is beginning to re-create.
"
5515,"Creation is created, so that the sequence is created, what is the physical existence ?
"
5516,"The senses themselves look after them in temptation in the Lord , but earlier we must return the senses to the Lord.
"
5517,"Let us get any form before our eyes , experience it - this is our form , and we are going to see everything.
"
5518,"Let us hear what the ears hear , we think - this is our Lord speaking , we are listening to every voice.
"
5519,"We experience some kind of odor in the nose - the Lord is being expressed as this odor.
"
5520,"Whatever touches are received, that is the same , we are receiving touch.
"
5521,"The tongue can get any taste , but let us be it - the Lord is the one who enjoys it .
"
5522,"Doing this is to make the senses lordless.
"
5523,"Let the Lord also serve the Lord.
"
5524,"In such a way, if the king comes, we should experience this same thing - the Lord has come to the king today.
"
5525,"With all the feelings of interest, get rid of the speeches.
"
5526,"In addition to the time constant chanting of the Lord , praise , genuine prayer , the Lord's speech patterns , gunavarnana be busy in the beginning of the speech.
"
5527,"When it starts to happen , then it should be understood - the voice returned to the Lord.
"
5528,"Thus, our speech , mind and intellect is fully turned to be eliminated in Yunan, certainly false affection , false pride will disappear.
"
5529,"Where there is an ego , that is the same.
"
5530,"When actually starts to be God's feelings , then we do not have this , nor will my children remain.
"
5531,"The only Lord remains in my place, and there will be a whole existence in my place.
"
5532,"But what else to do !
"
5533,"Most of the world's most commonly known worldly religions, the patriotism of the world, is being wasted.
"
5534,"So all the people of the village used to call him a vaginal brother.
"
5535,"The rainwater was watered with half water.
"
5536,"Grass house - straw cattle were hungry because there is no bhangyahaka.
"
5537,"So he thought - Today, near the village that is the rocky rock , there will be no grass anywhere.
"
5538,"And what else ?
"
5539,"The Bhangyaah brother ate a large dolly vessel and carried a whirlpool whiskey with stones on a stone carrying a sharp shift.
"
5540,"He reached that high rock and started cutting the grass.
"
5541,"He was just cutting the grass , he felt that the laughter was cutting the grass less.
"
5542,"So when he looked well , then he came to know - the laughter became gold, and its edge is over.
"
5543,"He started thinking - how did the smell of iron become gold ?
"
5544,"As a result, he missed a folklore - the iron stopped listening to iron.
"
5545,"Now Bhangyaah's brother has decided - there is a lot of money.
"
5546,"When he searched there well , he found it.
"
5547,"Now was !
"
5548,"He was very happy and began to think - why should the grass now be cut ?
"
5549,"Go home
"
5550,"By thinking this, Bhangaiah humbled Parmanmani and entered the village with the same laugh in his hand.
"
5551,"There was a golden shop in Ceyey.
"
5552,"He was doing his job there.
"
5553,"The goldsmith saw Bhagyaah and said to him - ' Bhangyaah Brother !
"
5554,"Where are you coming from '
"
5555,"Hearing this, in the heart of Bhangiyaah - ' Go , examine the paras with this goldsmith. '
"
5556,"Bhangyaah went to her shop and showed him the gem.
"
5557,"The goldsmith said, "" Brother !
"
5558,"This is a stone that is useful for us.
"

"
5560,"The illness of the Bhangiya Bahang was considerable.
"
5561,"He was pleased to see nightcloth and said - ' How much can it be ? '
"
5562,"The goldsmith said - 'The need is needed.'
"
5563,"That is exactly the same stone would weigh , but the brutal brother !
"
5564,"I do not want you to pay any losses.
"
5565,"So you can take more than two times. '
"

"
5567,"He started living a house with a nice home to stay comfortable.
"
5568,"When he wanted to , and accumulate gold Paras.
"
5569,"A few days later, when this talk spread throughout the village , then all the ancestors began to be foolish.
"
5570,"One day many people used to do the same thing - Bhangyaah did a lot of silly work.
"
5571,"At that same time a lord arrived somewhere.
"
5572,"People reverently greeted and prayed for a while and made refreshments.
"
5573,"In the same way, a person told them to Mahatma - ' Sir !
"
5574,"Some - some people are so stupid that keen to take place ratigedi. '
"
5575,"Hearing this, the Mahatma said - ' Brother !
"
5576,"If you see the idea - millions of people like you are like this.
"
5577,"Increasing to that unclean decision leads to increased grief and discomfort.

"
5582,"That is why rare men should get and try to achieve their real purpose.
"
5583,"Strengthen this thing in your mind - you do not confirm by the destruction of your body or by confirming your body.

"
5590,"He behaves himself to everyone by seeing the same spirit in all his spirituality.
"
5591,"Due to this nature, there is a disaster in all the world.
"
5592,"It is self-awareness , pure wisdom in seeing this world of distinction .
"
5593,"These distinctions are destructive and that illusion is immortal.
"
5594,"But only by protecting the roots, it is not even to cut branches and leaves.

"
5611,"There are two differences in the abdomen - a defective output and another disordered property.
"
5612,"The uncontrolled output is the name of the situation in which the leakage of power is locked , power is dissolved in power.
"
5613,"This is what the scientists say.

5868,"Many injuries and sores are still fresh.
"
5869,"India's world-famous Nalanda and Taksilla University, have not yet been able to fire.
"
5870,"The attacks on the common sanctuary of Hindus , Somnath , Vishwanath , Ram Temple etc, are still not dry.
"
5871,"Even after the Bharatiya Pradesh division , Muslim nominations of cities such as Ahmedism , Ghaziism , and Allahabad remained in the same place, but the root of all Hindu names was evolved in Pakistan.
"
5872,"There are still many mosques in India, but in other countries temples were destroyed or it was formed as a broken mosque or church.
"
5873,"Similarly in the Arab lands the atrocities on Hindus are fascinating in themselves.
"

"
5875,"He himself is not only better than that , what others say , that even look at it.
"
5876,"Laatsu and Tao - Religion
"
5877,"And there are many who are born in a historic watch and as an authentic human being.
"
5878,"There are also many other legends , interesting.
"
5879,"Some of them are even imagined , unbelievable , and amazing.
"
5880,"Just like a popular legend, a beautiful and extremely bright star in a dark night, had fallen out of the sky.
"
5881,"His holy descendation was revealed from that star.
"
5882,"According to another story, his mother kept her wearing 82 in the womb.
"
5883,"For 82 years , when she was born in her mother's womb , when she was born , her hair was all over.
"
5884,"Thus he was born as a mature , intelligent and aged person once .
"
5885,"But on the basis of information about him, it seems that he was born in a western province of China.
"
5886,"History about silence is often silent.
"
5887,"Later he used to work in a museum.
"
5888,"Or maybe it was a collector.
"
5889,"There are fewer knowledge related to his remaining personality.
"
5890,"He was alive by a simple , free and prosperous necessity.
"
5891,"People, based on the small brochure written by him, have tied the tone about their personality.
"
5892,"Someone has portrayed him as a single child, and someone has given him an image of an eternal neighbor.
"
5893,"But everyone has regarded him as a spirit , a delightful and unique figure.
"
5894,"After hearing his statement, Confucius was very impressed once again.
"
5895,"Confucius Laosucco was stunned by unusual behavior, but in his heart there was immense faith in the old man.
"
5896,"Distortions of contemporary society and the people who have seen their widespread valuelessness , ucchrnkhalatale Lao must have been hurt sensibilities.
"
5897,"When arriving at a huge wall of China, seeing the different flaws of old man, he tried to return to the back of the palace.
"
5898,"But after failing to return, he urged Laosu to write his experiences and knowledge as an archive.
"
5899,"It is an immortal work to establish the origin of nature and nature.
"
5900,"In this, people in the creation and rhythm of all creatures are adjusted easily.
"
5901,"This guide is the Tao - religion and Taoist thinking, based - source is.
"
5902,"It is a unique life of a devotee of religion.
"
5903,"He gathered disciples were not held by religious sermons , teaching did not , of sacred are separated , a mathamandira , the church did not organize.
"
5904,"Some pages were written in someone's request, and wrapped them in a bull and beat them in the distance of the remote.
"
5905,"Lao had no concern with the future of his thoughts.
"
5906,"His success was not the greed of fame , nor to those who disagree with his thoughts had to say something.
"
5907,"His questions did not listen and did not stop responding.
"
5908,"His life span is real or imaginary Tao's values ​​remain alive as a religion.
"
5909,"Taoka Three Ways :
"
5910,"The whole creation moves around the concept of Tao.
"
5911,"Taoo means ' path ' or path.
"
5912,"Tao - The followers of religion followed later by explaining it in 3 different ways , which are as follows :
"
5913,"1 In the first sense, Tao is the path to absolute truth , this path can not be seen clearly because it is senseless.
"
5914,"If it is published with overall growth and dignity, it can not be tied to a mortal man's vision.
"
5915,"Not only does the senses fail, that all the thoughts , fantasies will be defeated before it.
"
5916,"So definition and interpretation is terminative.
"
5917,"Lao-written book ' taote - Jing ' s very beginning it is :
"
5918,""" Tao not to be worn clearly. ""
"
5919,"Inaccessible , durvodhya and sarvaatikramanasila the entire existence is based is the last route.
"
5920,"It is also the mystery of the whole mystery and the eternal birth of the whole greatness.
"
5921,"In this sense , there is a need for secular insight to understand and follow Tao , which can be translated into words , so the TTP says :
"
5922,"They know that , say
"
5923,"And what they say ,
"
5924,"Do not know
"
5925,"2 . In the second sense it is the entire universe of the universe.
"
5926,"This is the rule , that rhythm , the rhythm that is not all over the nature.
"
5927,"This is the basic principle of the whole life of the world.
"
5928,"In this sense Tao is more powerful and provides one meaning to every item.
"
5929,"This different ' abstract ' (essences) , simply converted himself and his vibhutaa and well-translated the various chatama.
"
5930,"It is not a matter of feeling that never Stop singing , is not an.
"
5931,"The more it turns out, the more it becomes prosperous.
"
5932,"No one can live independently from its will and the rule.
"
5933,"No one can survive the floral touches of the creature, even though the ultimate blaze , tenderness and divinity should not be perfect.
"
5934,"Green leaves should be worn , forced to fall.
"
5935,"Nevertheless, this is sustainable and unlimited salvation and welfare.
"
5936,"This concept of Taoo is similar to the concept of the present eternal natural law in the ancient classical tradition , which is manifested in the human form of all creation similar to blood circulation.
"
5937,"3 . In the third sense, Tao targets the route that man directs his life , gives a certain direction and turns away.
"
5938,"However, this path is not the expression of the will of its will , which is the main urgency of the presentists of today.
"
5939,"This way the person chose for himself can not be in the rebellion of nature and Tao.
"
5940,"Instead, in contrast to this path, the path should be established with the general path of the widespread universe.
"
5941,"Three Tips for Power :
"
5942,"One of these three flows - another lie so different that they share the same common name and the base ( Tao - te - DPP ) should feel amazing.
"
5943,"Here are three ways to get strength - Received :
"
5944,"1 . Magic :
"
5945,"Magic is a way to travel to the universe of this universe.
"
5946,"From the adoption of this route, the most popular sect of Taoism was built.
"
5947,"Especially the belief of this vote was excessive in the superstitious and backward rural provinces.
"
5948,"It is very superficial and a type of distorted Taoism.
"
5949,"Because the concept of Taoism is very subtle and sweet, average people and their consciousness can not hold it.
"
5950,"Therefore, the logistics , mantrasadhanako to get through it.
"
5951,"Tao - te - chang's arrival from the deepest peak to the lambs of the peak is like a nimble Vimal mountainous lake, like the ground to grow in a flowing pond.
"
5952,"Tantra - A religion that is a victim of mantra has only been a method of polygon and Jharkhand.
"
5953,"2 . Yoga :
"
5954,"The mystic viewpoint gave birth to such a type of Taoism which can also be considered as an intimate sect.
"
5955,"The people of this stream believed in yoga as the Indian yogis and enjoyed the quality of silence and unity.
"
5956,"They used to keep the brain void , discipline the respiratory verb and yoga in other places.
"
5957,"Every community used to be such a complete seeker.
"
5958,"Through their meditation and yoga, they achieved one type of accomplishment , one kind of sharpness, which would be very impressive and emotional.
"
5959,"Although they did not appear clearly.
"
5960,"Even though uncomfortable , unacceptable and unwilling lives , their presence had a positive effect on social discipline and health.
"
5961,"This religious sect emphasized the inner dimensions of the person's outer dimensions and considered the outer world and body as a cover.
"
5962,"The only pure consciousness of the soul can be caused by freeing the soul from such a circle.
"
5963,"For this reason, a man should have a tender idea of ​​his narrow and selfish desires and completely in vain.
"
5964,"' Bail in silence ,
"
5965,"Lamp of your consciousness
"
5966,"Will be published
"
5967,"And that same
"
5968,"Will make a dwelling place. '
"
5969,"Indian yogiharulejastai taovadiharule the breath - those controlling the practice was very stressed.
"
5970,"They were convinced that living in a void brain would get undesirable happiness.
"
5971,"But silence does not mean abnormality :
"
5972,"' Mahatma believes in infinite activity ...
"
5973,"Keeps it in the background ,
"
5974,"But always comes forward
"
5975,"Stays out , but it's always inside.

5976,"Just because of your personal desires
"
5977,"His overall personal goals are not fulfilled ? '
"
5978,"3 . Views :
"
5979,"Power - The way to achieve the philosophy is philosophical.
"
5980,"Tao is a force that enters only in thoughtful and intuitive life.
"
5981,"In this sense, it is not an organized movement or a vision, but whose Chinese life - system had serious impression.
"
5982,"Depending on the person's thoughts and intentions, the person should always unite himself with the pseudoons and rhythm of the universe.
"
5983,"Jagatsamgako coordination or harmony pervades all life ' he Wei ' (Wuwei) is.
"
5984,"This concept can often be associated with inactivity.
"
5985,"But this inactivity is not a motivation but creative silence.
"
5986,"In this creative silence, the person is added to two unrelated situations.
"
5987,"Infinite functionality and widespread tolerance, the co-existence of these two contradictions, may be due to the fact that people are not limited to themselves and self-esteemed units.
"

"
5989,"This route to the virtue is quite different than the route described by Confucius.
"
5990,"Confucian ideal every effort anukriyaharu (Responses) to a format change jasalaivina towards building was reaffirmed as .Secular can be recycled.
"
5991,"Taoism was on the basis of raising the basis of its unanimity base, which is united with Tao's global stand.

6012,"'The bones of every point of the body will remain somewhere empty, otherwise the speed is not possible.'

6167,"On the next day, two thousand protants died.
"
6168,"Christians believe that they are fighting themselves like Islam's Sunnis and Sunnis.
"
6169,"Although there are two Christians in Europe in Ireland, Christians are different from Protestant and Catholic schools.
"
6170,"Protestant's children do not read at Catholic's school.
"
6171,"Catholic boys do not read in Protestant's school.
"
6172,"Reformists try to mix both the tricks , but the priests are not allowed to join .
"
6173,"As such, Fresher Shastri is the martyr Mahatma Mahajan.
"
6174,"This is also the martyr Mahatma Mahaguru.
"
6175,"Our religion , the religion of Islam and others also say that devotion to God is a refuge.
"
6176,"The Christian mission was viewed by the Nepali speaking "" Peace King "" .
"

"
6178,"He has shown miracles in it.
"
6179,"The blind , the daughter-in-law , the leprosy , the lungdool , have just released them from the disease.
"
6180,"So why did the hospital want ?
"
6181,"Share a small 30-page book entitled "" All religions are the same ?""
"
6182,"And the Vedas - vedantabhanda best that the Bible was written lekhiekobarema alialimathi.

"
6185,"According to his hard trying to find God's grace can not , isudvara fools Oh.
"
6186,"These things are not to be fooled by foolish children.
"
6187,"It is not because of the death penalty for Christians, Christians, Christians, suffer from all hell.
"
6188,"However, even if the sins of the Christians have been sinned by all the sins of the Christians, it is called no sin.
"
6189,"This is a big mistake, because it appears to be a violation of this sin-offering.
"
6190,"His next big error food is eaten anything , eat material pastainan mind.
"
6191,"Get out of the stomach slowly out.
"
6192,"But, as given by Prasad, idol worship does not eat food.
"
6193,"Just as a fool does not even understand himself or drinking anything that harm himself or society.
"
6194,"Peero bitter tastes, Jacob gahnaune khanuparda reasonable amount of kiln , the heart is false to say pastaina.
"
6195,"It is very untrue against the experience that alcohol adds to the mind for many hours, because it does not slow down.
"
6196,"Kiran Shankerjee wrote in the ' World religion alphabets ' page 166 -
"
6197,"It is my flesh to know that it is possible to break the life.
"
6198,"Katauro ( alcohol ) before moving the flame that piau This is my blood , eat and drink.
"
6199,"So, maybe, even in the church, the loafers are eating food in the same remembrance.
"
6200,"But it is very improper when people eat the flesh and the blood of the great man and remember the blood.
"
6201,"Drinking wine should be prohibited on the church.
"
6202,"In India's twentieth churches, they have eaten fruit in return for shoes and alcohol.
"
6203,"After the Indian Judge, we understand that we have to make a move.
"
6204,"Apart from dengue in Nepal, the main reason for increasing alcohol is also their association and encouragement.
"
6205,"Nepal Education Department is a big mistake to open the Christian mission.
"
6206,"There are numerous examples of service they might have made Christians , education is much easier to divorce converted.
"
6207,"Example of leprosy prevention service
"
6208,"Ashok Mehrotra went with friends to see there.
"
6209,"The children of her children are talking about a Hindu meeting, both Jai Yehu and a meeting.
"
6210,"Although there is a leprosy, the woman has kept her.
"
6211,"There should be no need to get married there.
"
6212,"But the spirit of Christian mission is full of wonders.
"
6213,"Aggressor of the mission refers to the fact that these 23 families have to be forced to take away because of no goats , alcohol and gambling.
"
6214,"Apart from the government, there is a fact that when there comes to understanding with the 23 families that are removed, the truth is found.
"
6215,"Those outlined people - we have removed ourselves and our children, not to be Christian , but to remain hungry.
"
6216,"As children are , and all after a year padhaumchaum , palchaum that heritage , father - mother allowed to visit only twice a year, Danny.
"
6217,"While looking at there, all the child's movements are Christian.
"
6218,"All children are saying Jai Isu.
"
6219,"He has also started leprosy prevention services in Nepal.
"
6220,"When visiting the mission in Kathmandu, the service was started with 125 leprosy patients , and everything was shown perfectly .
"
6221,"But the scribes wrote that he healed.
"
6222,"It would have been said that God or healing would heal.
"
6223,"But no Nepali was spoken about that.
"
6224,"What did Ram and Krishna do ?
"
6225,"Your Ram - Krishna only made a human sacrifice, our book has also written peace, and so on.
"
6226,"But the Bible is Luke . 12 come . 4 9 - 53 in the isule said -

"
6232,"Two forms of religion
"
6233,"Sermonopher Dharmo Him Kishidadity Naradhip.
"
6234,"The religion is known as Dynasty Panchayat Vishishta.
"
6235,"33. 32 ( i . T . J . W .)
"
6236,"(At one time the religion becomes unmatched, and the act of unrighteousness becomes religion.
"
6237,"Therefore, a wise man should understand the secrets of religion and iniquity.
"
6238,"Mahabharata Lord Krishna through the era of the designer - religion and appreciate the explanation.
"
6239,"Even if the macros and subtle forms of religion and the root and dynamic aspects indicate religion through the fine mode, they also explain interpretation.
"
6240,"Mahabharata is also a great addition to Yoga poetry.
"
6241,"There are many representative characters in it.
"
6242,"But they are prominent in many characters, Shri Krishna and Bhisham.
"
6243,"Both of these characters have two different approaches and behavior related to religion.
"
6244,"Bhishma, where the macros and religions are considered to be the real form of religion, Shrikrishna is dynamic and determines its subtle elements and untimely dynamics.
"
6245,"In this article, the activities and practices of the above mentioned characters reveal the viewpoint of his religion.
"
6246,"Karna - Mahabharat is a sacrifice and fierce warrior.
"
6247,"He also appears to be a great believer.
"
6248,"Early morning, donors donate according to the applicants who come to them before the sun.
"
6249,"He gets satisfaction from it.
"
6250,"For them, it is the ideal nature of religious compulsion.
"
6251,"Even though Karna senses Indra's trespasses, even then, the living creatures do not hesitate to donate to the name of Armaval religion.
"
6252,"The sacred work is also proud of the above suicide bombings.
"
6253,"After the death of Karna, the Kurukshetra war armor - rings appears to have pramukhakaraka.
"
6254,"Yudhidhir - Pandav Kuljadej is great and truthful.
"
6255,"The truthfulness of the Kaurav party is not a doubt in the truth and religious integrity.
"
6256,"According to the plan of Kaurav and his mother Ganandarkar Shakuni, Pandav is invited to play a jaw in the Kaurav assembly.
"
6257,"Pandavas in the jawans also cut off the Priya Dandupadi along with the state.
"
6258,"From this defeat, he needs to be 12 years old and 1 year secret.
"
6259,"The gambling game is predicted to defeat the Pandavas.
"
6260,"When the Jawanavity Pandav was called on, Kulakapat was thought to be from Kaurav side.
"
6261,"Even when the Pandavas understood this, he could not ignore that invitation.
"
6262,"Yudhishnir also cites the defeat of that tragedy.
"
6263,"Dhritarashtra Pandav's elder father is also King of Hastinapur.
"
6264,"In this situation alone there is a king and also a father's order, and on the other hand, the call for a jambah is also done according to the rule of law.
"
6265,"All these facts have to be acknowledged by the latter.
"
6266,"The pandavas did not only have the status of that scriptured religion that they had to suffer for the past 13 years.
"
6267,"Bhisham - Mahabharata is an important character of Sri Krishna.
"
6268,"Being an idealistic and dignified son, is devoted to religion.
"
6269,"The knowledge of public and behavior is not the same as the other.
"
6270,"He also has knowledge of Purana and the ancient system.
"
6271,"However, he continued to be active in Hastinapur, keeping the weight of the preservation of the power.
"
6272,"Bhisham Yoga is a symbol of rock.
"
6273,"Whatever difficult and unusual situation may come, they can suffer very much pain and mental stress.
"
6274,"But from his way he does not distract and remain unhappy.
"
6275,"Two brothers born from Vita Satavati were Chitrangad and the illiterate young woman came to Bhusham after she became young.
"
6276,"From Kashivar to victory over all three virgin wars in Kashi Rajra's wedding, Kishirajra's daughters were invited to marry both of them.
"
6277,"Among the two Ambika , Ambika and Ambika , two of the women married the Shantunkumar, but Ambika said she had already chosen others.
"
6278,"But even after bringing the force forcefully, he took a stand to marry only.
"
6279,"Because the Visham was tied to the promise that he would never stop, he could not accept the wife's wife.
"
6280,"Instead, the former man who requested to return to Amba wanted to marry.
"
6281,"But , unfortunately , the old man did not even accept him.
"
6282,"Amba again refers to persuasion by accepting his wife's distress and miserable situation, as a wife.
"
6283,"But vain !
"
6284,"Bhusham Amba can not accept it.
"
6285,"He is tied to his fate promise.
"
6286,"Amba is understanding the injustice done by his work.
"
6287,"But he is strong , his position is weak.
"
6288,"Bhishma does not oppose the unjust acts and decisions arising out of the Dhrirrassa's son.
"
6289,"When the Bhimsam's most desperate situation is, he is headed by Kauravaksha, the prominent captain of the Kuru region.
"
6290,"Pandav's victory ( which is the truth in his thinking ) is not possible until he survives in his military position .
"
6291,"Hence, Pandav tells the ways of his heart to be able to keep the desire of Pandav from the heart.
"
6292,"Although the Pandavas are true, they are bound by religion to protect Kauravastha.
"
6293,"Shri Krishna - The most prominent character of Mahabharata , is believed to be Goddess.
"
6294,"Shri Krishna has a variety of forms.
"
6295,"Ralila and Radha ( Parakaya ) with Balalala and the secretaries ! In the morning , with godly blessings , the goddesses have described devotion and beauty.
"
6296,"To obtain kingdoms by acquiring mama cones , black serpent suppression , protecting the Mathurais from defeat in Jarasundh war and other parts of the world.
"
6297,"Even when Devaraj Indra is cured, protecting Gokul and the Govardan Puja for the crisis is also done by ethnic protection.
"
6298,"Similarly , it was a work against the dignity of Yadavgana to help in the end of Arubun with the help of Subadra ( i.e., Shri Krishna's sister ) .
"
6299,"The above events of Mahabharat that social customs , dignity and Total - Religion and varnadharmasita are related , its two format and look at the behavior.
"
6300,"If the nature of religion is practiced by Bhismam , Karna , Yudhidhirir etc, then religion is a religion which is characterized by Sri Krishna.
"
6301,"Therefore , humanity or society of religion is the absolute benefit of all ?
"
6302,"Does it not have a disadvantaged relationship ?
"
6303,"Is it self-sufficient ?
"
6304,"These questions are natural to look at the above events.
"
6305,"Now let us analyze these events as well.
"
6306,"Religion appears to be two sides - the aggressive and dynamic side.
"
6307,"There is no doubt about religion's religious beliefs and similar behavior.
"
6308,"Hinduism and ideology are based on Vedic literature and instant social life.
"
6309,"From this, in the old systematic society, the status of anxiety and unrest began to rise.
"
6310,"In the peace festival of Mahabharata, Bhimam has discussed similar chaotic situation in the east.
"
6311,"But in the society, due to systematic change, it was practiced in the form of Karma Mandi.
"
6312,"Karna did not understand the historical background of that donation and its inherent motive, that only the word "" Dan "" would only contain a masculine word.
"
6313,"He did not even recognize the eligibility of the beneficiary, as the demand for anything to come before Sunrise, was considered the highest religious act.
"
6314,"But at the same time, Duryodhana gave protection to him because he did not even endorse the unfair and unjust work of Duryodhana.
"
6315,"It has been encouraged by the help of Karna and one reason for the Mahabharata war was encouraged.
"
6316,"Thus, in the name of devotion and religion, the vitality of the elderly and the deceased father got very bad decision.
"
6317,"After the Semen Shulka woman was brought out from the place of self-sacrifice, it was justified and fair to marry herself.
"
6318,"Bhisma's step- sisters were nervous (they did not have the ability to produce children ) .
"
6319,"It was a social offense to mobilize force on the other hand, in addition to inhuman action.
"
6320,"The demands of Kashishra Kumari Ambaba were fair and aggressive.
"
6321,"She liked her from Shelvazra, and she even shattered Shilvraj as her husband.
"
6322,"But after bringing the war before the Swami itself, it was their duty to accept them as a wife.
"
6323,"Shallavaraj did not even accept the Ambaba.
"
6324,"Accepting women as much as others did was against the social system and aggression.
"
6325,"Thus the disobedience of unnatural and untruthful promises did not even ignore social dignity and humanity as the highest standards of religion.
"
6326,"Yudhishnira, following every king, is considered to be the criterion of religion.
"
6327,"The said king is not suitable for publicity, that party is accessible to them.
"
6328,"Thus, the use of religion of Yudhishir was against the interests of the society and the interests of the society.
"
6329,"Thus, two forms of religion and Buddhism, Bhusham , Yudhidhirar Karna etc., took only the macro and root forms of religion.
"
6330,"He did not understand the subtle form and the essence in it.
"
6331,"The eyes of Shrimrishna religion, in the same way, the eyes of the eye understand the marma and take the essence.
"
6332,"He accepts religion with the freedom of humanity , freedom and society.
"
6333,"Religion is dynamic
"
6334,"It accepts the fact that society and humans are always giving direction towards the highest priority.
"
6335,"In his view religion does not imply humanity or emphasis on always being beneficial.
"
6336,"Shri Krishna brought in his behavior , the action that can not be religion , which affects human society in bondage .
"
6337,"Although the intention of a terrorist and brutal ruler of a concussion, without his own mind, should show him as a social liberation.
"
6338,"The Vidarbhraj Virgo Rukmini, who is forced to get married, seems to be fair and necessary to build a wife by taking away the wishes of those women.
"
6339,"Due to the love of Arjun and Sudhra Ekka, he played the role of the main partner in Subhra Harna.
"
6340,"Thus, the glory of human beings and two heart hearts gave glory to the high ideals.
"
6341,"There was a fierce work on one side left behind the mourning of the enemy Jarsasha, leaving the whole of Yambab Ganas along the island of Dwark.
"
6342,"On the other hand, the kshatra - also the opposite of religion.
"
6343,"But whatever brave observation was followed by the Kshatriyat religion, Yadav was also escaped from there and settled in the village of Puraliya.
"
6344,"Creation of Duryodhan Buddha , Zarasandhi etc. etc. by deceit was against the rules of war and iniquity.
"
6345,"But this was the belief that it was believed to be a public opinion against injustice.
"
6346,"There are many such works that have been prohibited by the scriptures, that Shrishrishna has been religiously involved in ethnic interest.
"
6347,"Basically true and justice is religion.
"
6348,"Anything that works with society and ethnicity is true, so it is religious.
"
6349,"Since this society is relative, it is determined according to the age , according to the era .
"
6350,"In the words of Prachapati volunteer Manu - a religious affair, the country has been celebrated.
"
6351,"The 37 periphery ( Mahabharata , Sha . P. ), that is, the same issue also causes religion to become religion or iniquity.
"
6352,"Religion is a rule and social ideology that really believes in the life of society.
"
6353,"Therefore religion should not be taken as root, as mobility and freedom, not freedom.
"
6354,"This is the direction of the writers of Ramayana Mahabharata and Vedic literature.
"
6355,"Society and the individual interests of the ethnic unnatinimti always active and are ready , fighting these men are venerable devatvabhavama.
"
6356,"Two dozen leaders of the arrested were arrested in Kathmandu

6720,"Agricultural manure - dandcha
"
6721,"- Bholaman Singh Basnet
"
6722,"Introduction -
"
6723,"The vessel is a virus that serves as a substitute for increasing agricultural production as organic faeces , compounds or green manure.
"
6724,"The lamps are about 60 ( sixty ) types.
"
6725,"Its stalks and bones are soft and they are easily cured when they give some moisture over time in the soil.
"
6726,"Since the soil mixed with fertilizer to scrutinize the work of the green state it is ""green manure"" is also called.
"
6727,"Both canard steam and frozen water can be consumed properly.
"
6728,"Filled hollow straw can be used to make wood and coal , rope of fiberglass , and green apples can be used as manure and cattle items.
"
6729,"Farming can be done on all types of soil.
"
6730,"Advanced yields , pesticides , advanced tools, etc., as well as stools are also not the main ingredients.
"
6731,"Even if the total amount of nutritional value is given, the person can not produce as much as possible.
"
6732,"There is no factory in the country to be a chemical stool.
"
6733,"We have been using this kind of sewage from abroad.
"
6734,"Now we have also become very important for the construction of self-made garments from the goods found in the villages where we do not have to depend on others.
"
6735,"Because sometimes there is no reason to buy or sell it due to the lack of chemical fertilizers.
"
6736,"What do you do in such a situation ?
"
6737,"Let our soil be made as unproductive ?
"
6738,"Many farmers can not use the money due to lack of money.
"
6739,"It is also important to use technical knowledge to use chemical fertilizer.
"
6740,"Otherwise, misuse can also misuse money and reduce soil.
"
6741,"This is a very important formula.
"
6742,"By adopting new technology, we have started taking two or three loyalty in one year and we do not allow the ground to take a moment.
"
6743,"In such a situation, nutritional requirements are important.
"
6744,"We could be cultivated on our land 25 , 50 or twenty-four years.
"
6745,"We produce each year is decreasing, but the beginning, ""not only take the soil to"" basalaum routine.
"
6746,"In the place where the new forest is fried, it is also good to keep storing for some years.
"
6747,"We have recently clay "" injustice "" .
"
6748,"On one hand, chemical manure say weaker soil is damaged, we should reduce the pressure on the other side or give it no more , and we also say that there is no production.
"
6749,"Our soil has not yet been able to sustain production.
"
6750,"Now the land is no more to increase productivity.
"
6751,"So we have to increase hector productivity for adopting some technology.
"
6752,"In comparison to the farmers of the developed country, it is time to take advantage of the economic vision of Nepalese farmers even to reduce the cost of less expensive or not money.
"
6753,"To maintain the fertile power of soil, we should take care of our health as well as take care of the soil's health ( Swallow Health ) .
"
6754,"Maintenance of soil can be a lot of other measures, as well as many other factors.
"
6755,"The use of the vessel also reduces the quantity of the chemical molecule that is recommended and can be adopted easily in large areas.
"
6756,"Due to self-frying, the result of phosphorus element in some cases is good, even though it does not give up.
"
6757,"What does biological males mean ?
"
6758,"For nitrogen, we take the urea or ammonium sulfate in the soil.
"
6759,"Especially this is the quality of the cats, and the cottage is also a bruise.
"
6760,"1 kilograms of gram paddy of local or advanced species requires 1 kg nitrogen.
"
6761,"Other nitrogen needs to be increased from this level.
"
6762,"Recent studies have shown that the rheumatoes in green soil are found to be an average of 70 kg of nitrogen hazard.
"
6763,"How to use the vessel in the field ?
"
6764,"The ground on which the ground is to be buried can be buried on the ground which is called "" green myiering "" .
"
6765,"The leaf or apple extracted in another place can be used by cutting into the field, which is called ' Green Life Manure ' .
"
6766,"The needle requires some water to be replaced in the soil, but it is used by a foam compound in the irrigated area.
"
6767,"Green manure or wings can be increased by applying the lentils to the fry.
"
6768,"The vessel can also be called inner ("" centercrap "") .
"
6769,"Rice can also be moved as dhaicalai ropami and its 'katinga' (pieces) also moves well.
"
6770,"Often, in which half of the Chaitra in the Terai and in the inner Madhes, the wheat is cut half and the paddy is planted in the saliva.
"
6771,"It is used in the short period of time between wheat cutting and paddy planting.
"
6772,"If the seed to produce dhaincako biubata to 5 - 6 months it takes.
"
6773,"Therefore, the use of dough has proved true in the world that especially the soil material increases the production of all the natural properties of the soil.
"
6774,"Vegetable green substances ("" biomass "") within 60 days of the rise in the terrain are 20 to 25 metric tonnes.
"
6775,"For green sewage and vij growth, the vinegar is required for a hemorrhoids of 30 and 20 kg respectively respectively.
"
6776,"Groundwater can be cultivated on the ground floor.
"
6777,"Valley, Inner madhesaharuma dhaincalai can easily be taken as green manure.

"
6783,"The only root of all the corners containing nitrogen is the respiratory glands.
"
6784,"Since this is a new type of blanket in Nepal, I have given some information below.

"
6787,"In the year 2042, 500 grams of Biz produced.
"
6788,"In 2043 years, 100 kg of gram and in the year 2044, Hirnath farming farm had produced only 600 kg of wheat.
"
6789,"Sunsari's Jharkhand farm produced more than 4 tonnes of wheat.
"
6790,"The farming will also be like a old dorm.
"
6791,"The new bottle is superior to the oldest of all, such as viruses and growth, etc.
"
6792,"Hector Boo can be produced easily by 1 , 000 - 1 , 500 kg grams from the new pillow .
"
6793,"Whereas the hectare brew was produced by 1000 yards of hard to old.
"
6794,"Because of hazards and pillars, there are germs that can easily nitrogen cytopathy even when the new fountain is frozen.
"
6795,"The seeds and stalks of this type of green are also green, and the plants and plants are green until the seed is cooked because they are cooking.
"
6796,"It is also a very good quality of new dishes.
"
6797,"There are many more activities in the stalks of the stalk.
"
6798,"It's a great friend for paddy farming.
"
6799,"Senegal estimates that the new millennium can be stabilized by 225 kilograms of grams ( equivalent to 600 kg of yuria ) atmospheric nitrogen.
"
6800,"One of them uses a piece of paddy, and uses two-thirds of the left.
"
6801,"Carrot is a green kidney necklace, and a lecturer is called "" Leg Hogogloveen "" when a bacterobid tissue is green .
"
6802,"Conclusion
"
6803,"Preferring priority to biological products in Nepal's perspective is very essential and timely.
"
6804,"As a result of this test, this new pillow is the best, and it contains 5 to 10 times the nitrogen soybean germs.
"
6805,"Biological sewage does not remove chemical faeces but also reduces the work.
"
6806,"Using organic manure mixed in chemical membrane adds "" golden fragrance "" .
"
6807,"Organic sewage will be proven for the farmer who has not used chemical fertilizer.

"
7508,"It has been resurrected for more than 200 years in other countries and recently in Nepal.
"
7509,"Treatment without this medicine is very proven.
"
7510,"Its original theory
"
7511,"1 ) In the body contact with the magnetic field, blood is affected, and the water properties continue to change due to the effect of the magnetic waves.
"
7512,"Similarly blood is electrically transmitted.
"
7513,"There is a stream flowing by simply improving the transmission of simplification easily.
"
7514,"2 ) The magnetic waves pass through the body's nervous tubes and produce secondary electrons, and the same heat eliminates pain and inflammation.
"
7515,"3 ) Magnetic remedies reproduce the capacities of the body and gives superb totals to its nutritional growth.
"
7516,"Refreshment tissues , punarjagaranakasathai red blood particles to enhance the medicine has taken an important place.
"
7517,"5 ) It gives strength to increase preventive forces contained in the human body.

"
7523,"3 ) There is no effect , effect or stress.
"
7524,"For many years hundreds of people can be used in many diseases, as well as financial imbalance.
"
7525,"It does not have to be spent for this.
"
7526,"The power can be filled with a momentum without power.
"
7527,"4 ) It is also used by other drugs as well.
"
7528,"Magnet experiment method
"
7529,"The matter of obesity has also been given in the book ' New Magnetic Therapy System, Introduction and Magnetic Therapy ' .
"
7530,"Currently, more detailed explanation has been made in this regard.
"
7531,"There are two poles of each kiss , the north and the south.
"
7532,"The North Pole kills bloody pesticides and does not allow them to grow.
"
7533,"Therefore, it is used to prevent deformation , dough , loot and other diseases.
"
7534,"The southern pole removes pain and sage etc.
"
7535,"If there is a disease in the semi or full part of the body, both poles should be used.
"
7536,"If the pain is in the top half of the nitro, then the north pole of the magnet should be left by the right handbag and the southern pole.
"
7537,"But if the disease is nitometrintir, then the north pole and the left pattala under the right foot should touch the hook to the south pole.
"
7538,"If the disease is all over the body, one day it should be damaged and packed with pattala.
"
7539,"The other thing is to use us in the right and right parts of the body, on the right hand, the North Pole and the Videotube should be used on the Via.
"
7540,"When using the magnets at the lower part of the body and at the upper part, in the upper part, the pole should be used in the north pole and the lower part.
"
7541,"Using similar to the previous and lower part of the body, it is necessary to use the north pole and the south pole in the front.
"
7542,"Magnet experimentation has been divided into two volumes.
"
7543,"( 1 ) ordinary and ( 2 ) local.
"
7544,"One thing is to say here.
"
7545,"The same magnet has two poles.
"
7546,"The problem of how to use it separately can be a problem.
"
7547,"Similarly, the magnet of the magnet is closed and used only in southern pole.
"
7548,"Therefore, a magnetic magnetic magnet should require two pairs of different poles.
"
7549,"Currently, Nepal is using magnet prepared in India.
"
7550,"On the north pole, 'R' ( R ) and 'L' ( L ) marks are placed in the southern pole .
"
7551,"The body should touch the 'R' ( R ) and 'L' ( L ) marks.
"
7552,"Even though the magnetic waves cover the cloth , even though it is very good to touch the naked part of the body when it is treated.
"
7553,"Touching only when touching the memory is reached.
"
7554,"Do not have to deal with it.
"
7555,"Again these magnets are different forces.
"

8190,"Life reservoir plant provides essential nutrients from the soil.
"
8191,"If the pots of soil are selected . H . 5 . Agriculture is required to be less than 5.
"
8192,"Exit and exit :
"
8193,"There should be a source of regular or reliable water source for irrigation.
"
8194,"Because water requires plenty of water.
"
8195,"The cost of production increases when the cost of more expenses increases and financial income from the garden decreases.
"
8196,"Whereas the cost of cheap and simple sewage is low, the cost of production is very low.
"
8197,"If the water is a place to boil, the temperature can not grow and spread.
"
8198,"Also, the procedure of germs in the soil is also reduced.
"
8199,"Water must be exhausted in such a place.
"
8200,"Traffic and Traffic :
"
8201,"The tapping of the production at the place where traffic is no longer available and traffic is not possible for sale.
"
8202,"Fruit drying , insects and cats.
"
8203,"So instead of being beneficial by farm farming, it is harmless.
"
8204,"Motor , truck , carriage etc. etc. is very suitable for plant farming, on the way to go to such a way or to choose a place near such facility.
"
8205,"People get traffic in the receiving facility.
"
8206,"And the production staple is easily sold.
"
8207,"When transportation of the hill at Mango - Garden antelope, instead of establishing the original road side - tents is the best.
"
8208,"Market facility :
"
8209,"Mango - the garden and the minimum distance of the market place is important.
"
8210,"Where there is a lack of traffic and traffic, there is a need to bear financial deficit in the market.
"
8211,"Fertilizers , medicines , tools and other accessories to bring the room to close the market to sell and mango must choose.
"
8212,"Geometric Ability :
"
8213,"Successful success or failure of farm farming depends on the number and number of workers found in that place.
"
8214,"Where the absence of a hired Mango - the garden to the special programs must be prevented.
"
8215,"In any season, cheap farming is available to help stabilize the farm.
"
8216,"Free from wildlife :
"
8217,"Stage - Staying near the forest area , sacks , fuouro , monkeys and other animals have caused the plant to damage the plant.
"
8218,"Also, the effects of various insects and diseases also increase.
"
8219,"Therefore, it is appropriate to choose the space that is free from these animals.
"
8220,"Stage - Garden plan : -
"
8221,"Mango cultivation in Nepal, in a planned way - the garden are minimal.
"
8222,"A few blocks and gardens built in planned schemes in some government forms and centers seem to be established.
"
8223,"For plant farming, after considering the place mentioned on above, detailed plans should be made at the earliest.
"
8224,"Schematically, the farming plant is very attractive - as well as direct or indirect financial benefits.
"
8225,"Therefore, the following consideration is very important :
"
8226,"Land and its map :
"
8227,"The land that has been selected has already been ascertained or not.
"
8228,"The map should also be shown on the map , where the array , location, and the building of houses and other buildings.
"
8229,"Bar closure :
"
8230,"The garden should be closed from around to time, but it is unlikely to open the door to the original door.
"
8231,"It is okay to put off your financial situation from band design and optim engineer or overseer.
"
8232,"The pillar of wood or cement should be 5 to 6 feet high and the cone wire is suitable to close the bar.
"
8233,"S - small goats and lambs into two tarakobicabata garden, they can harm the plant.
"
8234,"Therefore, it is very good to plant the bones of bars within the bars of the beasts that are unable to get them.
"
8235,"Air - resistant trees :
"
8236,"Hori - Vishas are only flowers, but the fruits also cause heavy damage.
"
8237,"Heavy gram flour also boasts , rolling and raising plants .
"
8238,"Mango plants to save this kind of damages the air - Anti-trees must be planted.
"
8239,"The plants that flow more frequently , should plant these plants by lineing 2 on that direction.
"
8240,"They decrease the speed of the wind up to four times the distance of air-resistant trees, and it affects the aroma plant.
"
8241,"These plants are more likely to cope around the bar.
"
8242,"Roads and Homes :
"
8243,"One of the main roads and the area of ​​the garden should be constructed some assistant roads.
"
8244,"Therefore, about 1 meter height of roads should be constructed.
"
8245,"Where the width of the roads should be, how many feet to install the garden depend on the scattering etc.
"
8246,"Auxiliary road should link the main road.
"
8247,"The main road should be connected with the path of public walking or outdoors.
"
8248,"The main road should be gate gate.
"
8249,"Requirements should be built inside a gate inside a gate.
"
8250,"Selection and Exit :
"
8251,"In order to establish a garden of arranged systematically, the wells and planets should be made in a planned manner.
"
8252,"Bars around the garden - about 50 minutes from the closet . Min . Not in the 120 . Min . x 9 0 to . Min . Make a corner of the size.
"
8253,"It works for irrigation and water.
"
8254,"The animals also take care to enter the garden.
"
8255,"Imputation of every 4 - 6 lines need to be looked at further to dig canals and small size of these noble.
"
8256,"These boats should make ' outlets ' to remove water from each line or between two lines .
"
8257,"Profile of Annual Program :
"
8258,"After installation of the garden, different work should be done.
"
8259,"Pulling weeds , planting , fertilizer filing , irrigation every year and that the fruits of work, etc. - experts advise.
"
8260,"So, according to the advice, the program should be prepared for the work and how to do.
"
8261,"Other information :
"
8262,"If you plan to plant various species of eggs, it is appropriate to plant the species or species at the same time.
"
8263,"Plant species should also be kept according to the type of pollution polluted.
"
8264,"Mango - the garden bee pollination also been observed, and it also will support.
"
8265,"Stage - Gardening Drawing Tips : -
"
8266,"Stage - In order to establish a garden, there is a brief briefing about the various ways to draw on which field and place where it is planted.
"
8267,"Therefore, leave about 6 meters of air - resistant plants and determine the initial line of the inside.
"
8268,"Then there should be one or more of the following ways to set the planting area , area or area in the garden : -
"
8269,"Square way :
"
8270,"In this way one - one is planted in four angles of the square .
"
8271,"Planting a plant is equal to one plant from another plant and distance from one line to another.
"
8272,"Each side of each square is equal to angle because the sides are equal.
"
8273,"It is good to plant a plant in such a way that the land that is almost equal to the whole area.
"
8274,"By applying plants in this way, it is easy to interfere and operate in the garden.
"
8275,"Even when mining the tractor, there is no obstruction of ' crushing ' or ' friendship ' on both sides .
"
8276,"Drawing a base base AX must first be drawn.
"
8277,"This line should be drawn by a lengthy string by parallel to the road or by the edge of the bar.
"
8278,"The bottom line AX of the A and X points, as illustrated by the picture horizontal rope AZ and another horizontal rope XY pull it.
"
8279,"A line of AX and AZ transit routes or air - blocking plants should start leaving 6 meters of land.
"
8280,"These rings should make 90 degree angles with the base of AZ and XY .
"
8281,"It is easier to use the formula for making an equal degree of equal degree.
"
8282,"E.g. -
"
8283,"AG 2 + AH 2 = GH2 In this form the length of AG is 3 feet long , if 4 meters of AH come to 5 meters of GH .
"
8284,"Similarly, base Bordeaux AX will also burst B, C and D towers in a distance of 12 , 12 meters .
"
8285,"Now the points A, B, C, D, and X are in line with the linear line.
"
8286,"In the rest of the squares of those sections, the fortresses burst and the second line plants in those places.
"
8287,"And type in the entire land.
"
8288,"The bottom line cord AX, horizontal cords, AZ and XY to underline all the land is easier to work.
"
8289,"In this way, we need to underline that many plants , including its number out formula is as follows : -
"
8290,"N = A / PPxRR
"
8291,"N = The number of plants
"
8292,"A = Area of ​​the land
"
8293,"PP = Distance from one plant to another
"
8294,"RR = distance from one line to another line
"
8295,"Rectangular way :
"
8296,"This method is like a square method.
"
8297,"In this way the four corners of the binaries a - memorial tree planted.
"
8298,"The way to build a rectangle is also a square in a square way.
"
8299,"This method is often considered more useful in the uniformity of uniformity in length width.
"
8300,"This method is also suitable for a flat ground.
"
8301,"In this garden marked by a tractor or other device, it is easy to minimize or mix both sides.
"
8302,"The bottom line AX while preparing occurred in the street or the bar 1 and the vertical rope AZ Air - Anti-way stretch occurred in line 5 should.
"
8303,"Removing the number of plants in this linear way, using square formulas.
"
8304,"But the distance from one plant to another is less than the distance from one line to another, because the number of plants becomes more than a square.
"
8305,"In this way, the roots planted in this way, planting a plant, is the number of plants required for a hectare land.
"
8306,"Punch tree type :
"
8307,"This is also called ' quincons ' .
"
8308,"All methods of linear are similar to the square.
"
8309,"A vote of four votes in each square of each square.
"
8310,"Another one is added to the middle of the class.
"
8311,"Therefore, each category has 5 plants.
"
8312,"The plant is considered to be very good for planting the stomach in the area where it is very cheap, because the seed plant utilizes the landowned land.
"
8313,"Various types of fruits or other palm trees can be placed among the class.
"
8314,"The formation process of cooperative organization
"
8315,"1 . Introduction
"
8316,"We heard you do some co-sansthakobarema - knows who we are.
"
8317,"In some of us, there might be an idea of ​​how to form a cooperative organization.
"
8318,"This publication has been sought to discuss the issue of how the organization is formed.
"
8319,"But before that, you need to understand two things.
"
8320,"First , the cooperative formed by those who can only , which is needed to serve the organization.
"
8321,"Because of the principle of cooperative, the person who can serve the organization is eligible to become a member only.
"
8322,"Secondly , in order to form a co-operative institution , you should be the primary producer to be a real worker or a real consumer.
"
8323,"Farmers , Kaligadh , Chelsea , Authors etc. are the primary producers, they are real workers , laborers , enthusiasts , etc.
"
8324,"In the same way, the actual consumer meaning that it can be used by ordinary consumers , passengers , readers, etc.
"
8325,"The primary producer is the person , who himself owns - that is , his production works.
"
8326,"Farmers cultivate cultures , make idols , writers write books , craftsmanship prepares craftsmanship.
"
8327,"These are all primary producers.
"
8328,"The person who does not make any shoes or shoes, but the other person who makes the shoe to make a shoe is not the primary producer.
"
8329,"In this situation, he is an industrialist.
"
8330,"Own shoes and helpful, but makes a - two partners was kept from him may be considered primary producers.
"
8331,"So they are the primary producers.
"
8332,"Such a person is a merchant , a fake consumer.
"
8333,"Of course, not to cooperate with industrialists , contractors , merchants , mediators or fake consumers.
"
8334,"The organization of traders and industrialists is not the right cooperative organization , but the industry or business association.
"
8335,"After understanding this, let us now discuss the work we need to establish a cooperative organization.
"
8336,"2 . Early head - advice
"
8337,"In a way you are just thinking about the formation of a cooperative organization in our minds.
"
8338,"Because it shows that you have reached the institution's needs experience.
"
8339,"For tapainhami alone or a - very few organizations can not form.
"
8340,"For this, there is at least 25 people in the cooperative law.
"
8341,"It should mean at least twenty five members should be able to open the Cooperative Institution, at least 25 people have considered the need for the organization.
"
8342,"There is also a desire to work together and be willing to work together.
"
8343,"However, it means that no one can be formed by cooperative institutions after completion of five.
"
8344,"There should be only five or more of those who are eligible to be members of the organization according to all cooperative principles.
"
8345,"Initially, we have come to know about what individuals are eligible to be a member of the cooperative.
"
8346,"From now on, what should we understand if farmers are cooperative in the cooperative cooperatives?
"
8347,"Even if we have tried to open milk cooperative institutions, only there can be cattle - breeding farmers only.
"
8348,"Similarly, if we consider the cooperative organization of peacock farmers, the farmers who are not honey are not eligible for membership.
"
8349,"Because the service of such organization will be related to the marine work, others do not come to get that service.
"
8350,"Similarly, even if she is a Shilpi in the organization of female culprits, men may not be eligible to be a member.
"
8351,"What that means is , this is what kind of society we would be , depends on it.
"
8352,"Now, again, sir - sallahakai let's talk.
"
8353,"If you see the needs of the organization, you may have seen others.
"
8354,"Therefore, our villages , toll members are eligible to be members , they should consult.
"
8355,"There are not only 25 , all members of the village , and those who are eligible to subscribe should be included.
"
8356,"Because even though the basis of cooperatives , the force is also your members.
"
8357,"In fact, the initial head - advice our future when we have a firm foundation for our organization.
"
8358,"So how much does not it hurry over.
"
8359,"3 . Early meeting
"
8360,"Of course, the initial head - sallahakai institution when so many things in the bud, is finalized.
"
8361,"However , once all , gathering together, it is good to gather together and make the final advice.
"
8362,"After deciding to form an organization, it is necessary to collect all the other tasks for all the other tasks necessary for it.
"
8363,"The earliest gathering program should be kept in place where appropriate and everyone can be present.
"
8364,"It would be better if possible from the cooperative officer of district cooperative office or any representative to call it.
"
8365,"3 . 1 The topics discussed in the opening meeting
"
8366,"( A ) the organization name , address and scope
"
8367,"Work area means that the organization is considered to be an area of ​​service.
"
8368,"Tapainhami this area who lives in Village Development Committee or municipality, or any one or more wards or two - three Village Development Committees as well.
"
8369,"You are our hands on how to place the work area of ​​the organization.
"
8370,"But determining many areas should be considered in many ways.
"
8371,"Keeping the work area very small, the members also get very little.
"
8372,"Because no organization outside the scope of the organization can be formed.
"
8373,"It is hard to say that this is good about work area.
"
8374,"This is a measure of how society is , it also depends on.
"
8375,"But for the authors of the organization, even if the work area spaces the district, it can be a cordon.
"
8376,"However , instead of building a large area at the same time , it is wise to increase the working area if necessary, after putting a small area at the beginning.
"
8377,"Because it is easy to add scope, but if there is a decrease, there may be a problem that can be done to other members of the rest of the area.
"
8378,"( B ) the objectives and actions of the organization
"
8379,"The topics that are discussed primarily after this - what are the objectives of our organization and what is it to do ?
"
8380,"The purpose is to understand what the last goal of our organization is.
"
8381,"The purpose is to guide the organization.
"
8382,"The organization is walking well on the way to better achieve its objectives , is considered as a success.
"
8383,"Therefore, the purpose is to measure the success of the organization , the evaluation of its programs.
"
8384,"On the other hand , no organization should work as a result of its objective.
"
8385,"How to determine the objectives of our organization ?
"
8386,"There is nothing to do with this.
"
8387,"But, as well as the desire of members of the organization, they can be taken into consideration to safeguards and promote the interests of the members.
"
8388,"In the second purpose, the public should have the interest of the public.
"
8389,"Because of the benefit of the members in cooperatives, the benefit or convenience of the public is also valued.
"
8390,"Therefore, it can be the sole purpose of the dairy entity to provide generalized consumers with quality milk at a reasonable cost.
"
8391,"What is the third objective ?
"
8392,"Consolidation should not only be seen on the one hand side of the economic growth of the member or general.
"
8393,"Even though progress and development do not just know the economic situation.
"
8394,"This is tapainhamro , our child - child education level , awareness level , health level, our village - the place hygienic environment is very hastily enacted.
"
8395,"In other words , in order to help in community development , our organization can have a unique and equally important purpose.
"
8396,"In addition, if appropriate, look at our organization, one or two other objectives can be added.
"
8397,"But even when making a long list of objectives, it can not be a clarification situation.
"
8398,"After determining the requirements , what should the organization have to do , what services the organization should do to achieve those objectives .
"
8399,"The organization works to Twelve - Fifteen or more can also be.
"
8400,"What , in the form of any organization , how many tasks or services are dependent on the source of another organization.
"
8401,"He can now be mentioned if the immediate financial situation can not be arranged for all the services, even if they can be given respectively in the future respectively.
"
8402,"However, considering later, it may seem like having to raise a heavy burden that can not be described as well.
"
8403,"Determining the tasks is also necessary to keep an integrated approach.
"
8404,"Similarly, if we make members increase their income, they should not be allowed to save their savings.
"
8405,"In fact, no cooperative organization should be avoided by the task of managing the savings of the member.
"
8406,"The main slogan for the publishing chain has signed up 1 tells us that it is .Nor , members of savings a habit.
"
8407,"( C ) share capital
"
8408,"Members of the stock capital organization have the stock deposited shares.
"
8409,"The person who wants to be a member of the cooperative body should buy at least one stock and thus the organization arranges the necessary services to the organizations through the amount collected.
"
8410,"The share of the organization can also be called the membership fee.
"
8411,"The share capital has a great significance for the cooperative organization.
"
8412,"So, you should emphasize the need for members to increase the share capital of their organization.
"
8413,"How should a company share a share price ?
"
8414,"In this question, the initial meeting needs to be discussed well.
"
8415,"Because we keep the name of a stock only if the institution is not capitalized.
"
8416,"If you keep a lot, you may not be able to subscribe even though you are unable to explain the amount of us.
"
8417,"If so, then it becomes worse.
"
8418,"Hence, if we keep the value of the stock a lot, then it may be like a artificial shaver in one sense for those who can not figure out that much money.
"
8419,"( D ) Entry fee
"
8420,"In addition to membership in the cooperative organization, there is a tendency to pay some entry fee in addition to the stock capital.
"
8421,"3 . 2 . The initial meeting has to do
"
8422,"( A ) draft sub - committees
"
8423,"Initial meeting to discuss the main , the main visayaharukobaremamathi was varnan.
"
8424,"Now, the establishment of the organization is to make the organization regulation , action plan , financial rules and employee rules.
"
8425,"But it's better to do that right now.
"
8426,"These sub - committees and the needs of a coordinator and three other members of the five - satajanasamma having to do.
"
8427,"After this work will be done on the basis of sub - committees two days later, after the draft is ready, all the people will be able to gather together for the meeting.
"
8428,"Miscellaneous (MISCELLANEOUS)
"
8429,"1 ) milk, xenobiotics (Bacteria) from the way of free and treated (Definition of Milk Pasturization)
"
8430,"Mammal milk (Mammals) Notwithstanding born whenever a liquid is used.
"
8431,"The most important thing for body growth is calcium in the calcium milk.
"
8432,"But milk is not very useful for the body growth, even if we use milk without processing it, it can be more likely to be less than its profit.
"
8433,"Hence, they are called ways to avoid the germs from the germs, and to process the milk as well.
"
8434,"That way can be done in two ways.
"
8435,"Such milk is suitable for all classes.
"
8436,"This method is similar to the way we treat our family.
"
8437,"2 ) The second way is to re-put the HTST ( high temperature short time) ie high temperatures on the milk.
"
8438,"The same way in the diary is processed and distributed by the milk.
"
8439,"In this way, at least 160 degrees F for 15 seconds is milked by milk.
"
8440,"As soon as milking milk at high heat, germs that are in milk will soon be destroyed and it does not harm.
"
8441,"There is no food in the milk that is not seen as adulteration.
"
8442,"But there is a lot of water in the market.
"
8443,"It is not so hard to lose it.
"
8444,"As far as possible use of milk, it should not have been exposed to the dry but dry ground and without replacement.
"
8445,"After milking milk, it should also be kept in a cold place and should always cover the vessels filled with milk.
"
8446,"2 ) on food adulteration (Food Adulteration)
"
8447,"Battabandi food (Tin Pack food) regardless of the chemicals (Chemicals) of consumers exercising the practice has come.
"
8448,"That type can be of 2 types.
"
8449,"( 1 ) to keep food for a long time and ( 2 ) commercially looks for profit.
"
8450,"As a result of the change in the color of foods, copper sulphate is added to the closure of green cereals like on the same side.
"
8451,"In the same way, as many as many other food items have been replaced, Saccharin is found instead of sugar instead of sugar .
"
8452,"The open grain gadiggies found in the market are also found to be included in food-rich food items.
"
8453,"As we use daily diamonds , oils , spices, etc. are also found to be a recipe.
"
8454,"Today, it is found that high-temperature glands are planting plants.
"
8455,"This is the tradition of pudding , liquid.
"
8456,"As a result of selling sweets, the practice of attracting customers to the brightness of the bread is also popular.
"
8457,"But all the mentioned examples of colors and things have not been investigated in our country, what has affected the people's masses.
"
8458,"These modes will not have any food to eat anything.
"
8459,"There is something that can be caused by food even if it is food.
"
8460,"Due to the harmful things of nourishing food in public life, it gets contaminated food.
"
8461,"Our country is in the line of line of poor country, which is deprived of nutritious food.
"
8462,"On the contrary to the effects of contaminated food, the angel is always suffering from disease.
"
8463,"Similarly, the pimple sprouted gourd makes it even worse.
"
8464,"Similarly , maize flour , rock , color etc. are found in the baskets , peppers , peppers , dust spices etc.
"
8465,"There is also a mixture of berries, such as berries, on mountainous basalt.
"
8466,"All of these are very harmful for health.
"
8467,"It is a remedy to avoid the fact that it is a matter of fact that housewives bring these garments more than dust to the house and make it dust.
"
8468,"The recipe in these food items can be easily checked and detected.
"
8469,"Unusual things can also be found by chemistry experiments.
"
8470,"In other countries, government-wise food items are being investigated and sales are sold only in the market.
"
8471,"But we do not see where the process is coming.
"
8472,"3 ) How to Make Some Foods (Receipes)
"
8473,"1 ) Proteins with Vitamins Drinks of Proteins and Vitamins
"
8474,"Required content : -
"
8475,"2 large chin proteinx powder ( found in a drug store ) .

8478,"Diary milk two cups
"
8479,"Method : - It is all set in a vessel to rotate a batter or put it in the blender for 30 seconds and drink.
"
8480,"If you eat this meal regularly in the morning of breakfast, then it is found protein getting vitamins.
"
8481,"2 ) Instead of recipes mentioned in other protein-based drinks, proteins and vitamins can be found instead of following the following recipe.
"
8482,"As : -
"
8483,"A ) Two curds in milk instead of milk
"

9147,"Similarly, in 1 9 60 - 61 of the total rice production in India this disease in about 266 , 000 metric tanale happened.
"
9148,"It is a major and harmful disease among more than 25 diseases in the Indian state of Paddy Bali.
"
9149,"In our case, this disease attack is often found in the palm of the year.
"
9150,"According to different tests, it will be proved that every 10 percent of the neck injury (Neck blast) reduces paddy production by 5 to 7 percent.
"
9151,"If the product is usually more than 75 outbreaks of the disease - 80 percent, to reach janegardacha.
"
9152,"Symptoms of disease
"
9153,"In any case of Dhanbali, it can start from the beginning of the early paddy paddy.
"
9154,"As a symptom of this disease, the thaws coming to the leaves are both side-shaped elliptical.
"
9155,"These dots are gray and white point in the middle of the thaw.
"
9156,"If the discomfort of the disease increases, these dots will increase the size of the thongs and mix them with a glimpse of the leaves.
"
9157,"The three main rice avasthaharujastai North, State ( Berna ) ganjiraheko state and heads of state is in this particular attack.
"
9158,"Bacteria of the disease
"
9159,"This bacterial disease is a plasma called Pyricularia oryzae Cav .
"
9160,"According to the area of ​​paddy cultivation and soak climate, this rust has many races .
"

"
9162,"Diseases - Cycle
"
9163,"The disease of this disease, especially in the patient's disease , the poultry of the palm trees , with the disease , shelter in various races etc.
"
9164,"Apart from this, it is not sure that this stone is located at the main shelter.
"
9165,"As it is mentioned on the above mentioned scenario, first of all, this stone attacks the Berna in the wage, which produces numerous odorous spores.
"
9166,"Everywhere, the spirits are produced and after attacking different paddy conditions, finally waiting for another Dhanbali.
"
9167,"Control of the disease
"
9168,"Improvement in farming : - In this way, complete control of the disease can not be done, but to a large extent the disease's disorder can be reduced.
"
9169,"Farming of disease-resistant species : - This is the way the farmers are the cheapest , easy and effective way.
"
9170,"That is why the time to change is changing.
"
9171,"The North, keeping the plant until at least 25 - 30 days old bernalai this disease usually can be saved.
"
9172,"Remember , there is 30 to 40 liters of water to stir well on a ropei ground.
"
9173,"( 4 ) It is memorable , the harmful condition of this disease is a deadly corvary.
"
9174,"Brown Diseases ( brown leaf spot)
"
9175,"The beginning and spread of the disease
"
9176,"According to a survey of the Commonwealth Molecological Institute, this disease has spread across all the landscape of the world.
"
9177,"Although it was not possible to see this disease in Nepal, it was formally recorded in 1965 for the first time.
"
9178,"This disease is spread across the Terai to the high mountain, where the Indian kingdom will be planted.
"
9179,"Diseases from the disease
"
9180,"In many countries that can be planted, this disease is considered to be significantly important.
"
9181,"The disease is found in different places after the disease is found in Nepal.
"
9182,"But in spite of special circumstances, this disease is not harmful as a disease.
"
9183,"Regarding the illness of the disease, particularly due to sick seed, the weight of the seed also reduces the strength of the seed.
"
9184,"It can be completely destroyed if a newborn is attacked, resulting in a decrease in the worm while planting.
"
9185,"If the outbreak of the disease over the boat ganjiraheko situation Bala white , empty well production aundacha great loss.
"
9186,"If this disease takes place during the paddy-cooking, there is no special damage.
"
9187,"But if this disease increases on hair, it increases the amount of sick seeds as well as excessive pogo.
"
9188,"Symptom Symptoms : -
"
9189,"In any case of Dhanbali, this disease may start from the fermented fermentation.
"
9190,"As a symptom of this disease, the thaws in the leaves are duplex, which are elliptical, which are similar to the size of sesame seeds.
"
9191,"Additionally, all the dots are surrounded by lightweight shore.
"
9192,"These dots also apply in addition to the leaves of the leaf and the gram (the gram of the paddy ) .
"
9193,"Bacteria of the disease
"
9194,"The bacterial disease of this disease is a plasma called helminthosporium oryzae .
"
9195,"It is the plague of gender situation (sexual stage) to kokliyovolasa miyabiyanasa (Cochliobolus miyabeanus) called.
"
9196,"According to the fertility area and the cold climate, there are many species of this stone.
"
9197,"When the attack on the paddy plant, this mold produces a chemical element called proteotelectric enzyme .
"
9198,"These poisonous substances cause diseases related to the growth of the plant , the respiratory system and the adverse effects of others.
"
9199,"Friendly environment
"
9200,"Farming of disease-related species and disease seeds are the major causes of this disease.
"
9201,"Loss of malaria ( especially the lack of nitrogen elements ), dry , alkaline and light soil may result in an outbreak of this disease.
"
9202,"Diseases - Cycle
"
9203,"The disease of this disease, especially in the patient's disease , the poultry of the palm trees , with the disease , shelter in various races etc.
"
9204,"Its extra extra amount remains in the soil.
"
9205,"After attaining the above mentioned environment, the first is the attack on the fermented fermentation and produces abundant spores .
"
9206,"These same spores reactivate and attack various types of paddy plants.
"
9207,"These vermins fall from one place to the other side by the sun.
"
9208,"Especially the main three stages of Dhanbali , such as barn , sore, and hair , especially during this period of attack , occur.
"
9209,"Control of the disease
"
9210,"( 2 ) 2% slice of yurea fertilizer in water made in water.
"
9211,"Bottom find blight ( Sith vlaita (Sheath blight)
"
9212,"The beginning and spread of the disease
"
9213,"This disease has spread across all the countries that will be the world's most fertile.
"
9214,"Although this disease was not recorded until 1968, there was a growing impetus of the disease since last few years.
"
9215,"This disease is now spread nationwide.
"
9216,"Diseases from the disease
"
9217,"This disease has begun to feel as an increasing problem in most of the world's paddy-making.
"
9218,"Recently, this disease has been calculated in most important diseases after expulsion in Japan and the United States.
"
9219,"In 1 9 67 matter , in Japan the disease outbreak 14 , 00 , 000 hectares of paddy land borders was a great harmed.
"
9220,"In this disease, one of the most commonly illicit diseases in Nepal is given a pediatric disease.
"
9221,"But in recent years, a growing outbreak of this disease that is seen in the past is not too late to spoil the disease.
"
9222,"According to a survey conducted in Nepal, this disease has caused loss of up to 25 percent in the production of paddy.
"
9223,"Symptoms of disease
"
9224,"As a symptom of this disease, the leaf sheath is seen in the elliptical theses that are first brown - brown.
"
9225,"Later, these dots increase their size and turn off in size, after which they go and turn brown.
"
9226,"If the outbreak is high, these dots reach the leaves while moving in the upper part of the plant and the entire leaves bite, and as a result, it seems like the whole plant is bruised.
"
9227,"Occasionally this disease also seems to be painful.
"
9228,"Bacteria of the disease
"
9229,"The bacterial disease of this disease is a silk named Rhizoctonia solani sasakii .
"
9230,"It is the plague of gender situation (sexual stage) to thanetophorasa Sasaki (Thanetophorus sasakii) called.
"
9231,"This mold also has many races .
"
9232,"This mold P - hydroxy phenailaesetika acid (p-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid) known as chemical substance that produces part of the plant kuhamucha patient.
"
9233,"Friendly environment
"
9234,"Education
"
9235,"What is the lesson ?
"
9236,"How does it get ?
"
9237,"What is its principle ?
"
9238,"The detailed study of the teaching is not uncommon to produce such questions.
"
9239,"Various definitions and principles have been developed from different scholars.
"
9240,"In this regard, R. Kenneth . Robinson (Kenneth R. Robinson) the training management in the book , "" a study of knowledge ,"" the treasury has said.
"
9241,"Similarly, Bernard (Bernard Bass) the "" practice and experience practical.Welcome changes "" to the treasury that has defined.
"
9242,"The child cries out "" birthdess "" .
"
9243,"When it comes to an open world from the womb, it experiences different experiences.
"
9244,"That new season experiences Rune.
"
9245,"Respectively , mothers' breastfeeding, swaying and shaving to bone.
"
9246,"These are the practical changes of all the children.
"
9247,"As a child grows up, it represents the whole person.
"
9248,"In that case, the environment develops more and more by developing brain.
"
9249,"His behavior also changes rapidly.
"
9250,"As a result of this, a person has been able to change his behavior until he was born.
"
9251,"Similarly, trainers are transformed into their practice after training and training.
"
9252,"Changing such behavior is called to learn.
"
9253,"This can be repeatedly derived from re-inforce and practice.
"
9254,"In other words, learning skills is to be learned.
"
9255,"The task is to be completed after completing the task of pre-training.
"
9256,"Editing can be done in two ways.
"
9257,"( A ) physical ( b ) mental
"
9258,"The same can also be found in both types of physical and mental.
"
9259,"Man is a social creature.
"
9260,"From being born in a poor society, there is something to learn from the dead.
"
9261,"But the work that hears up remains immortal in his mind.
"
9262,"Therefore, the teaching is a change in behavior that is derived from the evolution of practice.
"
9263,"After learning, a person who is learning is unable to do the job.
"
9264,"Learning transfer (Transfer of Learning)
"
9265,"Transfer is to take place from one place to another.
"
9266,"Transfer of teaching means to make a person's knowledge and sheep in another person's entry.
"
9267,"It will not be operated automatically.
"
9268,"(It's not automatic) .
"
9269,"Trainers are transferred to trainers from the instructor taught by the trainer.
"
9270,"In this perspective the instructor was a medium.
"
9271,"The instructor must be trapped by a trainer to make use of questions , questions, and knowledge that can help the trainees identify problems .
"
9272,"Taught only learning.
"
9273,"As the light of the sun requires a medium to come to earth , the need for medium is needed for transferring any knowledge and sheets.
"
9274,"The leaflets - The book can be acquired through various means of reading , hearing , etc. by various books and other knowledge .
"
9275,"But for example, it is also important to learn about certain subjects of special education in Sikku.
"
9276,"Due to the lack of satellite data, the famous historian can not make a map of the school building.
"
9277,"If the teaching based on such principles can not be transferred, the instructor should be considered unsuccessful or unable to give examples based on the theory.
"
9278,"Practice exercises and homework can be reduced if the principles are presented to be cleared.
"
9279,"Therefore, the following actions are to be done by the instructor to emphasize teaching transfer.
"
9280,"1 ) Confirming the principles and ideas that could not be understood.
"
9281,"2 ) To help resolve issues related to the taught content.
"
9282,"3 ) Let the trainees know the status of teaching and transfer facility to it.
"
9283,"4 ) To get the full-fledged problem , use the problem , discussion and question.
"
9284,"5 ) To train the learners, various measures should be taken.
"
9285,"There is another chance of learning a new sheet to interrupt the same shell.
"
9286,"This situation is called Negative Transfer .
"
9287,"Working with similar physical sheets at the same time, research has proved to be a negative impact on learning.
"
9288,"Just as you try to learn two identical languages ​​at once, there is a negative impact on teaching.
"
9289,"That is why it is appropriate to speak the language spoken in the school with your child and at the same time, not knowing the other language.
"
9290,"This process poses a positive impact.
"
9291,"But language and language spoken in the language is slightly different from teaching.
"
9292,"In such a situation, the victim can not be able to compete in any language.
"
9293,"In this situation the teaching transfer is negative.
"
9294,"Therefore, at the same time to look at the same sheep subject, the trainer should always be careful for the safety of the training.
"
9295,"Method of teaching
"
9296,"Kenneth R . Ravinson has been described as "" teaching theoretical method "" in the following drawings according to the following drawings .
"
9297,"According to the presenting drawings, the motivations of the pole are carried out by external excitement, the idea of ​​learning excitement or desire awakened.
"
9298,"Here, reflections based on experiences and reactions are pre-embedded.
"
9299,"Another external element that affects the teaching is the evolution that the instructor is used to develop the level of curiosity.
"
9300,"It is also a direct connection to the experience of prey.
"
9301,"Beyond Education : -
"
9302,"Robert M . Gagaley describes eight ways of teaching in the book "" Teaching terms "" .
"
9303,"Perception Of Learning (Concept Learning) is one.
"
9304,"We look forward to teaching the idea that we have rendering it in two parts.
"
9305,"1 ) child learning (Child Learning)
"
9306,"2 ) Adult Learning (Adult Learning)
"
9307,"The development of these two teachings depends on the concept of Concept .
"
9308,"Identification of the quality of the theme ( color , shape etc. ) and learning is called as perception.
"
9309,"For example, television can be taken.
"
9310,"Initially, the child recognizes it by watching the "" television "" or "" television "" .
"
9311,"When he learns the word "" television "" , the size of the television type , the color and the utility utility seldom respectively.
"
9312,"Thus, the concept of identifying inherent properties in the subject is called perceptions taught.
"
9313,"Get child. response (Response) If true, he is sure to have learned.
"
9314,"In respect of a child, a child can learn more from a lesser degree of perception teaching.
"
9315,"Conception teaches adulthood through the development of teaching and has a language lover with full knowledge of language.
"
9316,"Now she does not need to have a third idea of ​​childhood.
"
9317,"His teaching is short.
"
9318,"If no word does not mean, it is learned that the knowledge of pre-knowledge or other words connected with the knowledge of the word attached.
"
9319,"Through this way the adult receives the series of Verbal Chain .
"
9320,"Adults are subject to (Verbal) change once the idea becomes able to develop.
"
9321,"Adult learning "" concept used "" (Concept Uses called.
"
9322,"It S = external signal (External Signal)
"
9323,"S = stimulus [ attached to outer signal ]
"
9324,"R = Response (Response)
"
9325,"Discriminated nature of the capability
"
9326,"Adult learning to learn faster - Smart hunukosathai training much less learned.
"
9327,"The instructor does not have to perform and direct the routine path.
"
9328,"Time -saving occurs in the word re -inforce .
"
9329,"The purpose of the theme is easy to get.
"
9330,"Action Learning (Action Learning): -
"
9331,"The organization's objectives can not be achieved if the management side of any organization is not effective.
"
9332,"The administered side becomes stronger only by an effective administrator.
"
9333,"To develop an effective admin , the training technology is used as Action Learning .
"
9334,"What is the job teaching ?
"
9335,"How and where does this experiment be used ?
"
9336,"Such questions are not incredible in our minds.
"
9337,"Completion is obtained from practice.
"
9338,"In the real world (Real World) Only lectures and book knowledge alone is not possible to decide.
"
9339,"Decision making is a key role in the management of tightening the management side.
"
9340,"Learning a task is a collective training , it provides a wide range of effects to the learner , and develops a successful sheet in the decision-making process.
"
9341,"For example, the operation of organizations with international activities such as international airports is possible only by collective efforts of people with different skills and sheets.
"
9342,"Understanding with each other's work is also a learning process.
"
9343,"The action is a collective responsibility to resolve the problem will carry "" Work Instruction "" can be said.
"
9344,"Thus, the speed of teaching depends on ignorance and uncertainty , danger, and ignorance.
"
9345,"If the question is from the administrative side, it is resolved by a skilled person.
"
9346,"The invisible bhumikako study "" Work Instruction "" called.
"
9347,"How does work work ?
"
9348,"This question is also contemporary.
"
9349,"Due to lack of personal relations with the administrator, problem solving remains in reality.
"
9350,"In order to change the return of any work, the political system of the organization should be able to stabilize the barriers of change.
"
9351,"In order to develop this kind of capacity, the requirement of change from the high administrator to the entire staff is essential.
"
9352,"But we do not forget the fact that we react to every action.
"
9353,"In such circumstances, we must be more personal and organization's learning rate than the interference rate change ( R ) for living , flourishing and flourishing .
"
9354,"Or ,
"
9355,"Learning Rate > change = save
"
9356,"High-tech likes to live and develop the organization, but it is not possible from today's organizational thought and vision.
"
9357,"Therefore, "" task-teaching > change "" is essential to cope with the disaster change .
"
9358,"(Learning> Change) [> This sign indicates that there is no distinction or disorder ]
"
9359,"Finally, the return received from the solution to the problem is Action Learning .
"
9360,"Because of work, a thought and change is a fosterer, it is also possible to study less work from a lot of tasks and to learn more from fewer tasks.
"
9361,"The problem is re-structured and the "" work-teaching "" is obtained.
"
9362,"This creates an environment of disorder and instability and leads to proper questions and actions.
"
9363,"Mike pedalarale (Mike Pedler) has presented it to the mathematical formula so.
"
9364,"Which has been said to be related to P and Q.
"
9365,"Learning = program knowledge ? Bhaidabhavapurna Questions
"
9366,"The main objective of this technology is to enable the admin class to operate smoothly in the organization.
"
9367,"The admin itself is created to self-development the environment.
"
9368,"The work permit will be difficult to ensure that the work is not taught during the long run.
"
9369,"Attachment element : -
"
9370,"Learning is to achieve success accordingly.
"
9371,"After learning an emotional success, learning more and more increases in learning more.
"
9372,"The following elements are included in the application.
"
9373,"In the learning process, the element of the elementary element remains an important factor.
"
9374,"They have a close connection between each other.
"
9375,"Sheep teaches about them.
"
9376,"If one of these elements lacks the element, it is impossible not only to obtain the sheep in the lesson.
"
9377,"Sheet teaching can be presented in the formula in the mathematical language.
"
9378,"Sheep Education = Stimulation + Response + Evolution
"
9379,"It is clear from the above formula that a trainer should first be prepared for learning.
"
9380,"The only sheet achieves the teaching only when learning motivation is awakened.
"
9381,"Different measures should be taken to awaken learning motivation.
"
9382,"Different learning centers work in learning.
"
9383,"The trainees reach their mind through some genealogy about the knowledge they want to learn.
"
9384,"Therefore, one or more of many sensitivity helps to understand and remember what is taught when the sheet teaches.
"
9385,"From time to time, trainers have to respond to and understand the feedback.
"
9386,"It is easy to understand if the learning process responds.
"
9387,"With the response, the trainer receives an opportunity to improve his mistakes, as well as the evolution of the civilization is equally important.
"
9388,"Teaching a key emphasis to the above mentioned issues and teaching a lot of repetition is called civilization.
"
9389,"This process increases the quality of the sheet and the sheet is easy to read.
"
9390,"Therefore, if any one element is lacking, it is difficult to find the sheep in the form.
"
9391,"They have a close connection between each other.
"
9392,"These are the yoga lessons of the book.
"
9393,"Sheep teaching is not successful if any element of excitement response and evolution is lacking.
"
9394,"Changes in the behavior of the trainee seem to be less.
"
9395,"This reduces the return of the talent.
"
9396,"Effectiveness of the element : -
"
9397,"Learning is not easy.
"
9398,"Sourcing can also be learned in some quantities.
"
9399,"Can you learn the knowledge learned from the rhythm type of education without knowing the knowledge of the subject ?
"
9400,"There is no rules and principles for learning.
"
9401,"But learning has affected various things.
"
9402,"The following elements occupy an important place.
"
9403,"The instructor should always pay attention to the effects of education.
"
9404,"Therefore, the seven words mentioned above are called "" Mopcari "" .
"
9405,"The "" word "" opens "" from the first letter of the English word to each element .
"
9406,"Learning from their proper use increases enthusiasm.
"
9407,"Motivation : - This is a force, which leads to a person's goal.
"
9408,"What is the power ?
"
9409,"It is hard to describe motivation without definition.
"
9410,"Force is tied into the following formula in the scientific language .
"
9411,"Power = task x distance
"
9412,"The goal of each lesson is.
"
9413,"Power is required to get the goal.
"
9414,"The task and time span of the target to play the crucial role in which goal is needed to achieve the goal.
"
9415,"Time is Strong.
"
9416,"Key diseases and their control in Kausarak Bali Group
"
9417,"Majority of this vegetable Bali group is primarily Materkera , Ghushiami , Tetanici , Tanavadi etc.
"
9418,"Genoa is found in Africa.
"
9419,"These crops are cultivated throughout the Republic of Nepal.
"
9420,"Many of these young state baliharuko fruit ( pods ) of vegetables are used as.
"
9421,"It is very important to produce wholesalers in the country like us very fast.
"
9422,"This is especially the amount of protein protein.
"
9423,"Vitamin ' A ' and ' C ', carvohitrates and other minerals are also rich in addition to this.
"
9424,"This increases soil fertility.
"
9425,"On the one hand, farmers try to increase the resources by consolidating coal, and on the other hand, the attack on various types of harmful diseases seems to be hindered.
"
9426,"It is appropriate to know special things about these harmful diseases.
"
9427,"4 . 1 Anthracnose disease
"
9428,"Be sure to be dependent
"
9429,"This disease also seems to be in many other crops similar to cough plant.
"
9430,"Geographical spread
"
9431,"This disease is found widely spread across the countries that are cultivated by Kosovo.
"
9432,"The most commonly known disease is recorded in 2022 in Nepal.
"
9433,"Bacteria
"
9434,"The disease's bacterial bacteria are Colototrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. & Magn.) Bri. & Cav .
"
9435,"The main stage (Perfect stage) glomerela lindemuthiyanama (Glomerella lindemuthianum) bacteria are.
"
9436,"Symptoms of disease
"
9437,"This disease is seen only in the parts of the ground on the surface of the ground.
"
9438,"After finding the plants 2, the symptoms of the first disease appear to be obvious.
"
9439,"Leaves and other parts of the first dots S - small and light gray in color, and after the wet season dots are dark gray.
"
9440,"After these hides are hidden, pinky seeds are born.
"
9441,"Such symptoms may also appear on the lower surface of the thin surface.
"
9442,"The main veins of leaves and small - small veins to meet the stalk and look the same as the dots.
"
9443,"The most commonly illicit symptoms of the disease in the green cells are illness ( Picture 13 ) .
"
9444,"In these dark grains are rooted in the form of black and gray portions of the rubbish , the light gray shades of the shore , the circle around the circle increases.
"
9445,"After a corner of Pakistan, the shore edges are like a little up.
"
9446,"Causes of disease are very difficult to sell in the market.
"
9447,"Symptoms of disease on the seed
"
9448,"Black spots appear on the sick seed.
"
9449,"White and around the edges black , these red stains are slightly red.
"
9450,"The age of the patient seeds is greatly reduced due to the loss of the product.
"
9451,"The main source of bacteria
"
9452,"The sick seed and the sick plants are the main sources of this bacterial.
"
9453,"These stones spend time on the outer surface and the seeds.
"
9454,"It is known that seeds can survive for 2 years.
"
9455,"Disease cycle
"
9456,"The disease of this disease will come out of both seeds and soil.
"
9457,"They can easily survive the patients in the soil, but they can not survive for many days by separating them from dust.
"
9458,"When the patient is planted , first of all , the syruplings are produced in the thaws.
"
9459,"The spores come out afterwards in them.
"
9460,"These vitamins of pink color begin to attack disease.
"
9461,"Initially, these spores are covered with thin things like a foam and can not be easily picked up by the air.
"
9462,"Water covered soils should be covered by hazardous spores and spread them from one place to another.
"
9463,"These vagors attack new crops in a pleasant atmosphere.
"
9464,"To spread this disease, the most pleasant season is about 100 percent relative humidity and 13 - 56 degrees . The temperature is appropriate.
"
9465,"27 degrees . Above the temperature, it is difficult to attack this disease.
"
9466,"This disease is spread very dangerous in terms of cold and rain.
"
9467,"This disease is broadcast from insects , humans and other animals , animals , tools etc.
"
9468,"Patients in Nepal
"
9469,"This disease was not the most important disease in the vegetable group which was cultivated in Nepal.
"
9470,"Recently, this disease has started to appear widely in many areas.
"
9471,"According to the survey conducted in the year 203 9 , SIMI was leaked by the disease , took place in Bhaktapur district.
"
9472,"Simple measures to control disease
"
9473,"1 . Improve the farming system
"
9474,"It is the best way to plant a sick seed.
"
9475,"So taking out the seeds, only seeds should be removed by choosing a healthy ill-treated cortex.
"
9476,"- How many plants should be burnt by planting plants, or to reduce the deep pit in the ground.
"
9477,"- It should be used for a 2 - year trip to a trip.
"
9478,"Because of these many plains of dependent crops, it is necessary to make other crops available in that place.
"
9479,"- To reduce relative humidity, the flavors should be raised equally.
"
9480,"Also, the soil should not be kept too cold.
"
9481,"- As far as the plants are growing in winter or during rain, no one will enter the field of land , otherwise the spores begin spreading and spreading.
"
9482,"Seed seeds that are disease - free systematically produce more.
"
9483,"Therefore, the habit of applying seed certification should always be used.
"
9484,"- Plant should not be planted near each other.
"
9485,"Near the ripples of the plant, near the air, air can not be reached and there may be more disorders of the disease.
"
9486,"2 . Diseases of disease prevention
"
9487,"The variety of species of Simi that can cause this disease is very effective.
"
9488,"3 . Use of chemical medicine
"
9489,"A ) Treatment of seeds through medicine
"
9490,"Since the seeds are being planted grows out of it before the disease thirama or daithena M - 45 Drug 2 - 3 kg per seed treatment must gramaprati.
"
9491,"In this way, all the bacteria in the surface of the seed are destroyed and seeds start to grow well.
"
9492,"B ) Shifting of liquor of medicine
"
9493,"It is important to take full care of the things in the upper part of the upper part of the beast than the ground.
"
9494,"If causa is also expected to have a disease, it may not be possible to attack the disease at the earliest for the medicine mentioned above.
"
9495,"4 . 2 Rust disease
"
9496,"Be sure to be dependent
"
9497,"These diseases are mostly dependent on the Kosesali family.
"
9498,"Geographical spread
"
9499,"This disease has been found in most of the world's neighboring countries.
"
9500,"In the countries where there is more than 95 percent of relative humidity in the season, this disease is increased.
"
9501,"Bacteria
"
9502,"The Uromyces phaseoli typica Arth of this disease is a bacterial bacterial.
"
9503,"This bacterial has proved to be very harmful for most coconut groups.
"
9504,"Symptoms of disease
"
9505,"The symptoms of this disease are mainly visible in leaves and cats , only visible in stalks and horns.
"
9506,"Initially, the upper and lower parts of the leaf S - small white dots, some persist (Pustules) appear on.
"
9507,"These dots take a total of 5 days from the beginning of the disease to begin to get infected.
"
9508,"This kind of dot gray-colored bacteria dhulaharule (Uredosori) full ( picture 14 . 1 ) .
"
9509,"Similar symptoms also shows pods appears ( picture 14 . 2 ) .
"
9510,"After planting, the same thapla produces the second kind of teliosori of black black gray color.
"
9511,"When the seeds produce great production , then the leaves are filled like a vermillion color.
"
9512,"Due to this, the leaves start drying and leaves it later.
"
9513,"Symptoms of disease on the seed
"
9514,"This disease is not a disease from the seed.
"
9515,"The main source of bacteria
"
9516,"Bacteria of this disease can continue to live in the land area of ​​Kosovo.
"
9517,"In the place where hot water is hot, patient plants live as a urodorpor.
"
9518,"In winter, they live in the teliospor.
"
9519,"Disease cycle
"
9520,"It is the same disease disease in the same crop to complete your life cycle.
"
9521,"Plantation starts on the soil from the teliospor.
"
9522,"They grow and symptoms of the disease appear on the leaf.
"
9523,"Within a week, the urodorpor is produced in these dots.
"
9524,"These strains fall into the stomata and spread in the cells inside the leaves.
"
9525,"Due to this, they start to boil.
"
9526,"They need more heat to aging and attack.
"
9527,"If favorable weather cycle if they are 10 - 15 days repeats again.
"
9528,"Patients in Nepal
"
9529,"This disease has been recorded in Nepal in the first 2022 years.
"
9530,"Initially, this disease was seen as smoothly in simi , body , peas.
"
9531,"Due to the increase in the bacterial disease of the disease, the increase in the production of these crops has been deteriorated.
"
9532,"Simple measures to control disease
"
9533,"1 . Improve the farming system
"
9534,"- All the seeds of disease related to the disease should be collected , shrubs and snacks of liquor and burn it into the pit and immediately burn.
"
9535,"- The rotation process should be adopted.
"
9536,"2 - 3 years at the bean harvest, is it appropriate to wear nothing else.
"
9537,"- trees planted, no pieces have repulsed.
"
9538,"Rope in some distinction reduces relative humidity and does not increase the disease.
"
9539,"2 . Use of chemical medicine
"
9540,"A ) Treatment of seeds by planting seeds
"
9541,"Although some scientists mentioned that this disease can be caused by seed and can spread the disease through the seed, no concrete confirmation has been found.
"
9542,"But the seed on the surface of bacteria can stay because vebhistina , Medicine ( 0 . 1 per cent ) by seed treatment seems to be appropriate.
"
9543,"B ) Sheeting and making a mixture
"
9544,"To control this disease, sulfur and Choon 1 : 2 ratio mixed with 2 - 3 times, the dust should be sprayed medicine.
"
9545,"A hectare jaminakolagi 20 - 25 kg in need of medicine.
"
9546,"C ) Drugs by shaping medicine
"
9547,"Alcohol vaccines, as soon as the disease is seen . Created 1 percent drops to 10 - 10 times a day at an interval of 3 charnale outbreak of drug halved too.
"
9548,"4 . 3 white powdery mildew disease
"
9549,"Be sure to be dependent
"
9550,"These diseases are dependent on different crops such as wheat , barley , fungus , coconut and other liquor , fruits etc.
"
9551,"Geographical spread
"
9552,"This disease is spread across most of the world's countries, such as Canada , Australia , France , Peru , Zimbabwe , United States , etc.
"
9553,"In Nepal too , the disease of this disease is increasingly increasing every day in the mountains , terai , valley etc.
"
9554,"This disease was recorded throughout the year 2024 years.
"
9555,"Bacteria
"
9556,"The disease's bacterial bacteria are Erysiphe polygoni DC .
"
9557,"This bacterial makes the whole spread on the surface of the surface completely like a stone powder like white powder.
"
9558,"Symptoms of disease
"
9559,"The symptoms of this disease appear on the leaves at the beginning and then on the other green parts of the plant.
"
9560,"After attacking the disease, on the surface of the leaf, on the surface of the leaf , sticks , lumps, and crows appear to be thorns like white backs ( Picture 15 ) .
"
9561,"After the disease is shattered, the area of ​​these dots increases, and the white dust of the plush is spread throughout the leaf.
"
9562,"When there is a favorable environment, similar symptoms are known as far away from whole powder in all parts of the plant.
"
9563,"These stones on the outer surface of the plant, especially white thread and spores are sprinkle.
"
9564,"Symptoms of disease on the seed
"
9565,"Facts scientists say this disease can also be born from seed.
"
9566,"Seeds look good when looking out.
"
9567,"Stained starch threads can remain in the seed.
"
9568,"The main source of bacteria
"
9569,"The main source of this bacterial soil is soil.
"
9570,"This disease can also be born from seeds.
"
9571,"Besides this, the spiral spores from the air spread from one place to another.
"
9572,"Disease cycle
"
9573,"This stone attack begins with a type of sporadic (Cleistothecia) clay .
"
9574,"It is attacked by the ascospores in the bottom of the leaf lying in the plants.
"
9575,"This produces a Haustoria product.
"
9576,"These are bound in the inner part of the outer surface (Epidermis) .
"
9577,"This kind of mildew and leaf satahamadosro bijanuharu (Conidia) produces.
"
9578,"These spores are spread as a curry.
"
9579,"The hidden spots appear in the ground and fly from the air in different places.
"
9580,"Thus, the cycle of the disease is repeated.
"
9581,"Dry weather and soil are less humiliated due to the discomfort of this disease.
"
9582,"Patients in Nepal
"
9583,"This disease was seen many years ago in Nepal.
"
9584,"Earlier, this disease did not cause much damage to vegetable farming.
"
9585,"Although this disease is spread around the country recently.
"
9586,"Every year, peasants are standing as a major problem.
"
9587,"After attacking the disease in a very dangerous situation, even in Kausa, it is also covered by bad stomach, and it also turns back.
"
9588,"This type of corn market is difficult to sell.
"
9589,"Simple measures to control disease
"
9590,"1 . Improve the farming system
"
9591,"2 . Disease prevention
"
9592,"Early breeding seeds can reduce the risk of disease.
"
9593,"Because this disease usually attacks many times during flowering.
"
9594,"Therefore, if possible to plant such a fast-growing species, the disease can be removed.
"
9595,"3 . Use of chemical medicine
"
9596,"A ) Drug scalp
"
9597,"By recent tests, weaning of sulfur can cause control of the disease.
"
9598,"A hectare jaminakolagi 15 - 20 kg drug 10 - 15 days apart should be 3 times the grave.
"
9599,"Density of map and credit :
"
9600,"Map and landing rates have a very close connection.
"
9601,"Let's look at how the relationship between the two is increased.
"
9602,"There are two sides of a border.
"
9603,"A ) The records of the map of the map and the land of the land are as complementary to each other.
"
9604,"Why these are related to each other.
"
9605,"If one is not one, the work of others will drain.
"
9606,"B ) How many linear quotes are mentioned on the map, so much detail in the shredder is opened.
"
9607,"The srestale bid phutairaheko map is , the mapping is the same dull without a map.
"
9608,"C ) Shutter does not exist without the map, on the other hand.
"
9609,"D ) The birth of the map is first born and the birth of Shasta is born.
"
9610,"E ) Map of land is based on maps as per map.
"
9611,"F ) on the map four units , area improvement and more details if the mapping update immediately had to put by.
"
9612,"Operating on the map of some addictions on the map.
"
9613,"Is ) of land for sale does not mean that the transaction costs of fixing the updated book field , plot, etc operations registered.
"
9614,"H ) But if the map and credit are not operated simultaneously, one of the disabled is incomplete and incomplete.
"
9615,"H ) 021. Over 22 years, time-sharing times of the landlord officials have not been completed.
"
9616,"Therefore, if the details of the contents of its supplementary component were completed in the map, the problem would not come.
"
9617,"How to update the landmarks and maps of the land ?
"
9618,"To update the map and credit, please note the following things as described below.
"
9619,"Land data is updated from Shastastra etc., if the technical work on the map is made from the updated Metropolitan Branch.
"
9620,"Therefore , the use of proper use , reputation and updating of credit should be of utmost importance from the beginning of the work.
"
9621,"B ) The name of the office to be held for the technical checklist for updating Map Fieldbook in the measured district.
"
9622,"The order regarding its administrative supervision and how much the cut-off is from the commands.
"
9623,"Technical supervision , instruction, and problem solving is from the department's department.
"
9624,"Depth of the Depth of Employee of the Meteorological Department, Internal data is sourced for 2 or 3 years.
"
9625,"The employees of the measurement share the deposits deposited department.
"
9626,"The work and order are considered as merchandise , so it is not possible to say that there are approximately two members of this branch.
"
9627,"Also, it has dual responsibility as follows :
"
9628,"A ) The measurement branch serves as the technical advisor of the freight office.
"
9629,"The surveyor of the Meteor Branch gives the Chief Minister the knowledge of technical work and provides advice on the technical difficulty.
"
9630,"C ) If any of the sold out of the land is not sold, then the new boundary number should be provided by the new border to the map update.
"
9631,"How much to cut the new moon is an integral method for the daily business related to the land.
"
9632,"Therefore, the task of replacement of real legal rights and how much of the land is so important.
"
9633,"How to calculate map scaling method : -
"
9634,"A ) The following two methods have been adopted while compelling : -
"
9635,"[ A ] aphisamai washy kittakata the table.
"
9636,"[ B ] To cut off the border cross border, click on the land.
"
9637,"The area of ​​Village Panchayat area is tackled in the office.
"
9638,"And 3. After 4 months, there is a provision for the people to go to the respective land.
"
9639,"In the field of land of the town Panchayat and the Headquarters area, the gaps are cut off.
"
9640,"Because the land of these areas is more value.
"
9641,"B ) Problem problems and solutions to how much it is cut : -
"
9642,"[ A ] component and a different area of the map to check beyond the trial to improve naksabamojima area.
"
9643,"[ B ] waived mentioned and the actual direction [ toward ] a different instrument is necessary to correct the wear paper.
"
9644,"[ C ] If the map does not fit according to the land, it will be improved according to the land.
"
9645,"[ D ] After selling the buyer, it will be best to crack on the land to not reach the border dispute.
"
9646,"C ) Making a file map when making a very small difference : -
"
9647,"The small map of small size is a separate map of file size.
"
9648,"B ) If the map map is usually two folds or two times larger than the map, it can be shown to the extent that the 1 land area is also displayed.
"
9649,"A ) kittakata new nanvara to : generally 3 ways to give new nanvara are : -
"
9650,"A ) Old practice [ fascinating system ]: as . NO . Four units of 207 to 207 / 1 207 / 2 207 / 3
"
9651,"B ) Indirect Numbers Practice [ Free Naming System ]: As . NO . Change 5 to 671 , 672 , 673 etc.
"
9652,"This is called a number of practice.
"
9653,"In most of the world's countries and this practice in Nepal has come into practice.
"
9654,"Microfilming for the protection of the map and the categoria ( f . Bu .) :
"
9655,"The map and field book prepared in the field must be kept secure.
"
9656,"According to its practice, the map is trapped, but f . Boo . Is not made for another
"
9657,"Ft . Boo . The original record will be lost if not lost.
"
9658,"Hence the name of the following intent f . Boo . The microfilm of the map is being done respectively :
"
9659,"A ) The description of the time of the measured time is exactly the information and if it is necessary, be immediately available to it.
"
9660,"B ) Employees indirectly f . Boo . Determine starting details when corrected.
"
9661,"C ) Description of many documents can be protected by a microfilm in a safe way in a small way.
"
9662,"5 . 6 . Computing the map with digitization and content :
"
9663,"Today, scientific instruments can be used in the present era of modernity, if possible.
"
9664,"If necessary , resources and manpower are available for its fulfillment , the following tasks need to be started.
"
9665,"A ) To quickly digitize all the maps by scaling the map according to the requirement.
"
9666,"B ) Providing map paper printout.
"
9667,"According to this, the use of computer has been started at some post office office like Kathmandu.
"
9668,"It's a positive startup.
"
9669,"Due to the use of the computer itself, it can be used as a method of integrating the following days as it is filled with its programming and system prevention.
"
9670,"This system has been modified to return to the accuracy of the map.
"
9671,"Coordination of measurement and freight :
"
9672,"Map-keeping rates and credit cards are as per the pay of each other.
"
9673,"These are the coordinates of motor and gasoline.
"
9674,"No gasoline , no car , not a car, but petrol is not the way to coordinate the level of coordination and district level and central level coordination.
"
9675,"A ) Considering the district level coordination, the following commands come to light
"
9676,"After that, freight law is applied in the district.
"
9677,"Land rich landscapes are prepared from the administrative staff. The Department of Technical Affairs is being provided with the help of the employees of the Mantra Municipality held in the internal affairs department.
"
9678,"It is clear to know if the modern administration of the freight system does not work in this sense, unless the work is done and the use of the measurement measured by the freight is not clear.
"
9679,"Therefore, there is no need to say that the mortgage and mortgage keepings are as per the pay of each other.
"
9680,"B ) Considering the central coordination, the following ones are shocked
"
9681,"B ) Drafting Act 034 to 7 . According to 1, the Rights Department of the Meteorological Department has been delegated.
"
9682,"Coordination Conclusions
"
9683,"The role of freight officials in the position of keeping maps and credits is big.
"
9684,"On this, we want to draw some drops as a conclusion of coordination that is given below.
"
9685,"1 ) The scope of the land remains in the Malpot office and the records of the Map Field Book remain in the measured office ( branch ) .
"
9686,"In this connection, keeping the map and Shasta well done, most of them are the best to bring two units to the same office.
"
9687,"However, because of the situation and situation of the country, our company has used to work closely with the unit.
"
9688,"2 ) In order to facilitate credit updating, there is a need for absolute cooperation and cooperation between freight officer and measurement chief.
"
9689,"It has been coordinating map operations and land administration, and it is hoping that the future will bring more comfort.
"
9690,"4 ) Malpot officials must have the following technical knowledge on the map in order to match the map shots.
"
9691,"A ) Maps mapping ( large value , sanomana ) related name
"
9692,"B ) Knowledge on map readings
"
9693,"C ) Knowledge of removing land area
"
9694,"5 ) There should be central level and district level coordination in measurement and freight.
"
9695,"6 ) Both sides are the same as two-way mode of one coin.
"
9696,"5 . 7 auction complaint and free land registration
"
9697,"Registration of land for land administration is an important task.
"
9698,"Computerization can not be counted on computer while single-click and clear when computing.

"
9700,"You need a good personality.
"
9701,"In Section 1, it is mentioned that girls are more important than your face.
"
9702,"Actually, if a boy sees the beauty of her beauty and how kind of sexual intercourse on a girl, then the girl is first to look good personality.
"
9703,"But good personality does not mean a well-organized body.
"
9704,"Not even a good height.
"
9705,"Let's say, looking at the photographs, is not the type of good it is.
"
9706,"Who can give him importance as a woman?
"
9707,"Many girls said that during their interview , they would be more attractive than the face , thought , work and talk.
"
9708,"The other thing to influence personality is to be some reserve.
"
9709,"You should talk softly and friendly.
"
9710,"But never give up your importance.
"
9711,"What important is the idea of ​​girls to become your favorite personality, so you should really do exactly what yourself is.
"
9712,"As far as the pick - up by the girl's life partner into question , the girls admit any circumstances.
"
9713,"Just as successful acting, it keeps it as if it was something to be confused.
"
9714,"Such an act that does not appeal to girls being that it is so aphujasto the girls pick - up to the original formula.
"
9715,"I say
"
9716,"There is no need to show anyone different than that.
"
9717,"In order to influence girls, most of them tend to showcase what is not real.
"
9718,"But I just like the boy who looks like just as friendly.
"
9719,"Lesson - 7
"
9720,"You should not see too many nerves when you talk.
"
9721,"Talking to girls is not a question of life - death.
"
9722,"So you have no reason to be nervous.
"
9723,"For example, you see a beautiful girl on the bus.
"
9724,"Pick him - up to the idea that it is the tree, and if you have no reason to be nervous, no.
"
9725,"Because most of them will have a positive attitude, and what if they get angry ?
"
9726,"You have a bad experience once.
"
9727,"Whereas the girl pick - up to be a need to wait two months.
"
9728,"So remember that you are not successful, even though not successful.
"
9729,"It is less likely to be nervous.
"
9730,"Another reason for nervous is that you will become nervous and fear that the girl will feel bad.
"
9731,"You do not have to worry about it too.
"
9732,"Because girls do not feel so bad to get nervous in some quantities.
"
9733,"The same is the idea of ​​these girls :
"
9734,"So, initially, someone is somewhat incomplete, I believe it and I believe it.
"
9735,"Still, I'm more interested in a boy who speaks less hesitant than a boy who is obviously like a salesman.
"
9736,"Devi : - In the meantime, if a boy comes to speak with full confidence, I am afraid of fear.
"
9737,"Because I think he works similarly to stirring the girl.
"
9738,"So initially some nerves are not abnormal, and the girls accept it easily.
"
9739,"Therefore, you should not be afraid of nerves being unusual.
"
9740,"With fearless girls pick - up to.
"
9741,"You will be successful.
"
9742,"Lesson - 8
"
9743,"The need of ignorance is necessary.
"
9744,"Here's an important thing you should know about pick - up girls .
"
9745,"Some reasons girls are suspicious due to some reasons.
"
9746,"Only because of the cable cover you do not like the idea that girls are not pick - up.
"
9747,"They allow pick - ups only after they are indefinite that they are indifferent to you .
"
9748,"The point of view is that they do not like to see girls as objects or objects.
"
9749,"You can pick them - up by some short time, the young girl to pick - up to the notion that if the girls had their pick - up disturbing.
"
9750,"Devki says : "" I just saw me as a body , and I would not like to look like another girl.""
"
9751,"I'm just pick - up when a boy really likes me.
"
9752,"But if he does unknowingly at a slight amount, then I think he is new to do such work and feel better.
"
9753,"I do not want to be one of many.
"
9754,"These girls are really that girl that they pick - up an expert working on the same overpass pick - up do not want to be.
"
9755,"So if you are not going to do so, you feel uncomfortable and do something uncomfortable.
"
9756,"Those whose children pick - up makes it easy for you to do.
"
9757,"What the course ' new talk to that girl, but I think really hard, you're talking about yatti beautiful that I could not stop my mind. '
"
9758,"Sentences such as etc.

"
9760,"Girls do not like unmatched boys.
"

"
9816,"The first Sunday, is : They want to be praised.
"
9817,"It has also been mentioned in Section II.
"
9818,"1 . Coffee farming background
"
9819,"( Introduction )
"
9820,"Coffee beverages like coffee are hot drinks.
"
9821,"It contains refreshments such as caffeine and triggeline, because of the refreshment and joy of the body.

9823,"Coffee is an important nudity in Ruby family.
"
9824,"Its more than 70 people , upajatimadhye commercial perspective, the world market only two races rovastra Robusta and more are coming in use.
"
9825,"The origin of Aravica coffee is believed to be in Cappa, Ethiopian, and the success of Ravetracci coffee is in Uganda of Central Africa.
"
9826,"This is the origin of the Arab countries.
"
9827,"The South India hill, respectively coffee - farming was slow.
"
9828,"Brazil is the world's largest producer.
"
9829,"BS 2035 gulmikai Turnag , kurgha , Digam valithuma , owner , rupakota spread even more places.
"
9830,"This is the main place of Madanpakhara.
"
9831,"2 . Coffee nursery
"
9832,"Nursery is a place where liquor is produced.
"
9833,"Since the seeds prepared by seed are very fertile, then those fertile plants of the nursery should be made to be planted for a half and a half years.
"
9834,"Before setting up the nursery, you must pay attention to the following.
"
9835,"Bad picking place : -
"
9836,"Seed compilation : -
"
9837,"Selection of seeds for seed production from seeds should be made to produce a healthy plant and good production.
"
9838,"Seed preparation : -
"
9839,"After removing the outer bowl of compressed seeded seeds, the flacqua of coffee must wash the water three times , four times.
"
9840,"Designed to wash the ash dust phakletalai well bier 5 - 7 days in the shade must be dried thoroughly using.
"
9841,"The treated seed should be planted in a month after fifteen days.
"
9842,"It may be very late or over-dry.
"
9843,"Preparation of the Bed : -
"
9844,"Coffee nursery land 3 - 4 times better to cultivate the fine shall be made.
"
9845,"Bedding space must be 6 feet long 3 feet width and 6 inches high.
"
9846,"In this place, 6 parts of the forest must be clay , 4 parts compound and one piece of sand.
"
9847,"Seed planting : -
"
9848,"To avoid drying of moisture on the bad or protecting from the birds of the bird, it should be properly covered with scarves or straw.
"
9849,"The condition of the moisture should be given water in 1 - 1 week.
"
9850,"Thus, seeds planted in 45 days for 60 days.
"
9851,"All seeds should be removed from a half-handed prints, to remove them from a direct ray of the sun, slowly and slowly after their age.
"
9852,"Plant Transfer : -
"
9853,"The leaves of the year can also be used if the plastic is not available.
"
9854,"It is possible not to have a second nursery in the ground.
"
9855,"Towen so much should be kept in line with no sun rays , uniform water line, and dry arm printing should be taken from one and a half hand.
"
9856,"The prepared preparations should be used to lighten the leaves at the clay or soil while moving through the evening.
"
9857,"The seed can move on to the stage of 3 feet.
"
9858,"The condition of the hat , the two can find the condition and the four, when it is necessary to take care of it carefully.
"
9859,"1 . Water should be properly distributed to the seed.
"
9860,"2 . With the help of a stick, the root of the plants should not be shaken.
"
9861,"3 . Bamngieko , just cudeko , disease and unhealthy plants phyam if it's given.
"
9862,"4 . The root root of a healthy and fine seed one and a half inch should be cut.
"
9863,"5 . The roots of the liver should be buried only as much as it was on the surface of the soil.
"
9864,"6 . In a nursery or in the middle of the plastic tive, the stick should be planted straight to the vessel.
"
9865,"7 . Planting water does not need to be solved.
"
9866,"Work in nursery : -
"
9867,"They are required to take good care after they apply to the nursery plants.
"
9868,"In this situation the plants are very calm , due to various diseases , it can die by dropping well, bone corpse , leaves , etc.
"
9869,"Keep the printed nursery in the winter during the winter and keep it open in the night and keep it in the summer open during the night.
"
9870,"By doing so plants grow well.
"
9871,"Thus, the reproduction raised by care is worth the plant in the garden 14-14 months.
"
9872,"3 . Establishment of coffee garden
"
9873,"For the farming, to make it successful, the surface of the area is filled with air , water , soil , and so on.
"
9874,"According to the same way, farming deals with success and failure.
"
9875,"So, before the establishment of the garden, it is essentially necessary to select the appropriate place from the technique of the technology.
"
9876,"Water and soil : -
"
9877,"Air coffee , water and soil are important for successful coffee cultivation .
"
9878,"If coffee and soil are not suitable then coffee cultivation can not flourish.
"
9879,"The main element of coffee cultivation is the temperature and temperature of coffee.
"
9880,"The temperature decreases as much as the ocean surface increases.
"
9881,"The land returned to Mohawk before the return of the South Mohaah is more cold.
"
9882,"Therefore, for coffee cultivation, it is also necessary to have appropriate moisture under the ground above the environment.
"
9883,"Due to climate change, the cold water supply of our country is expected to grow cold and mountainous mountains.
"
9884,"But coffee plant in Rastrata is successful in the warm water of the inner Madhes.
"
9885,"On the basis of soil and soil, alababa and ravastraffa coffee are based on the needs of different types of environment, according to the submission of coffee.
"
9886,"Impact of water at low production : -
"
9887,"1 . Floral carpet and lack of human errors last April - May no human errors.
"
9888,"2 . More water on the flowering day.
"
9889,"3 . Assault is more hurt.
"
9890,"4 . Do not drink more water in the year of Baashak.
"
9891,"5 . Loss of cold or stomach in the soil.
"
9892,"6 . More moisture on the soil.
"
9893,"7 . Even if the wind or the turmoil is high, the product is depreciated.
"
9894,"Land selection for coffee farming : -
"
9895,"Due to the choice of land for cultivation, coffee should be returned east of North-i.e. area of ​​the same area of ​​the area.
"
9896,"That is why it is not appropriate for a land that can not be sunlight for a day.
"
9897,"The land which has more stones , more dry land , and more landy land is also not suitable.
"
9898,"The area where a small amount of light water is available with a wide variety of glasses, should be chosen as a light and thick soil area.
"
9899,"If the soil is not thick, it can also improve the soil with the help of compost and dung mud deeper.
"
9900,"Since the root of the coffee is more roasted than the root of coffee, land with strong stones is not appropriate.
"
9901,"Ground cleaning and preparation :
"
9902,"Do not be cut off completely and do not have to burn fire during the cleanliness.
"
9903,"Planting Lineage Line : -
"
9904,"After preparing for the land, it should be done for a coffee plant to draw the distance of the digestive pit.
"
9905,"Drawing the ground must be measured by the help of a rope or a stick.
"
9906,"The distance to coffee is different depending on the amount of coffee.
"
9907,"Furthermore the fertility of soil and the size of the land may vary.
"
9908,"For the mountainous area the depth of the crana system and the triangular method and the square size for the earthquake, ie, the line of planting plant by combining the line.
"
9909,"The drawings Paarai species of coffee a ropainis 80 - 100 and robastra coffee 60 - 80 plants.
"
9910,"Thus, the underlying land should indicate the place where digging of the pit.
"
9911,"But drawing on the places or in the jungle with full shadowy trees can also have a fist over the distance.
"
9912,"Khadal Kharn and Parney : -
"
9913,"Approximately a month before applying enough coffee plants, one should have a length ( one- and- a- half ) length width and depth of deep depth.
"
9914,"The clay top surface and the soil below should be kept separately when the said pit is dried.
"
9915,"Thus, it should be raised as much as 6 cubits higher than the surface of the ground.
"
9916,"By doing this, soil is not afraid to boast water again.
"
9917,"Then in that place the garbage must be buried.

"
9932,"Currently, the latest educational materials and their short introduction are given here in Nepal.
"
9933,"Section - 3
"
9934,"Management (MANAGEMENT)
"
9935,"Wild rabbit is considered to be the world's easiest survival and preserved mammalian animal.
"
9936,"But, if a commercial vision is not able to survive, it does not have any significance.
"
9937,"If the right way to do not work properly, the benefit of the beneficiary comes from a huge loss.
"
9938,"The themes considered to be very important according to the management are as follows : -
"
9939,"1 . Environment - ( a ) Temperature (Temperature) and location (Site)
"
9940,"( B ) the relative humidity (Relative humidity)
"
9941,"( C ) Air or air (Ventilation)
"
9942,"( D ) lighting (Light) and sound (Sound)
"
9943,"2 . Home cages law - ( a ) litter the cage (Cage with straw litter)
"
9944,"( B ) lodging cage without (Cage without litter)
"
9945,"( C ) loose and need to be owning the cage (Cage in scavenging system)
"
9946,"( D ) Nutrition arrangement for the child
"
9947,"( E ) Vegetable arrangement for grains - water.
"
9948,"3 . Exercise , sanitation and wool harness system
"
9949,"4 . Form record keeping system
"
9950,"5 . Breeding system
"
9951,"6 . Sewing system
"
9952,"7 . Sacking method
"
9953,"Kharayopalana rabbit farmers contend the law relating to the nature of optimal (Behaviour) about the information that is important to keep clear.
"
9954,"Rabbit main - the main traits is briefly described here.
"
9955,"Any species of rabbits, the dust grains do not like when dhulorahita clean grain - grass to be made available.
"
9956,"( B ) the social nature (Social behaviour): - rabbits often live in groups paraumdachan mind.
"
9957,"But Mauo rabbit does not even have a baby, even if the child attacks others.
"
9958,"His mother rabbits Bath (Heat) in the samayamabaheka other times very badly attacked by its own area of the male arise.
"
9959,"After this, the baby sticks milk after a short time after getting a baby born.
"
9960,"This usually leaves milk only once in 24 hours for milk and once the spare is not filled, it will feed milk for a half-a-half month.
"
9961,"In the wild condition, Mau keeps preparing the bridges of her child before going to seek a look, stops the soil and prepares various ways to escape from the habitat.
"
9962,"The spear bars also determines the surface area from its drainage.
"
9963,"Because of these reasons, keeping the rabbit in a new hollow or a new place, the first thing is to determine the area of ​​the place where it is.
"
9964,"Likewise , life deficit 40 kg in complex condition . M . The rate of one hour can run.
"
9965,"But there is no question about the cloves inside the pit.
"
9966,"( E ) sexual behavior (Sexual behaviour): - years old male seek female rabbits are very playful.
"
9967,"After the spear that the female looking for a spear, he came to know the poison by going to the ground.
"
9968,"Similarly, the woman also tries to get out of the pit and go to the spear.
"
9969,"This kind of nature has been found to be more important in the development of Angora.
"
9970,"If one of these things is a mess, if there is an adverse effect on the raw product, it is briefly described here.
"
9971,"Especially the angora species of the highest temperature is 25 degrees . Keeping in a hollow can only produce good products.
"
9972,"In the meantime: middle-class parts of our country's mountainous districts are excellent for rabbit.
"
9973,"Even if there is mountainous district, it is not beneficial to make a hazardous work in scratch heat.
"
9974,"Another thing , rabbit sweat - gland, even though the internal temperature is about not - about count on the same.
"
9975,"Because , your body's internal temperature to adjust these four measures apnaumdachan.
"
9976,"Similarly, if the atmosphere temperature is 10 degrees . Going down below, the frustration of protecting yourself from the winter keeps the body tight and reduces ear temperature.
"
9977,"Mr F . Livasa and friends ( 1 9 86 ) - kaanusara rabbit ears vehicles Radiator (Radiator) lejastai works.
"
9978,"By adopting the above measures, the ability to adjust the physical temperature is not less than 1 year old children.
"
9979,"Due to their long hair in the body and nervous - system is the lack of full development.
"
9980,"Despite the help of body fat, some try to combine temperatures, they can not eat completely cold and require a very warm environment than mau.
"
9981,"Therefore , newly born children are at least 27 to 28 degrees . The arrangement to keep the nest in the nest.
"
9982,"30 - 32 degrees . The nest of the child with a temperature is believed to be the most suitable temperature.
"
9983,"But if one temperature decreases or increases, they start to die due to body temperature.
"
9984,"So , the rabbit age , race , gender , condition, based on the temperature of the cage and the nest should be fully kharayopalana.
"
9985,"But by keeping in the vomiting, maneuvering humidity humidity continues.
"
9986,"When the humidity humidity decreases by 60 % , the air begins to become dry and the heat increases , and consequently the rabbit begins to die.
"
9987,"Similarly, relative humidity decreases or increases in the same situation as well.
"
9988,"Another thing is relative relative humidity over 80 % , even the ammonia gases die, they are consumed.
"
9989,"The important thing is that even if the temperatures and humidity is very high, the quarrels can not survive.
"
9990,"Due to the above reasons, we have died more in the rainy season in our country, which has also been examined by Lumla Agricultural Center.
"
9991,"During the increase in relative humidity and temperature, the physical growth of the rabbit also decreases.
"
9992,"Ataevah rabbit den 60 - 70 % humidity is considered to be the best if.
"
9993,"Rabbit cages temperature , air movement - maintain a moderate amount can be taken to adjust production only if the rabbits well.
"
9994,"The above reasons, the rabbit den 2 - 3 . 6 m 3 ( cubic meters ) havaprati's . Yes . The weight should be tensed.
"
9995,"To adjust the air prasaranadara electric fan pit (Electrically Powered fan) and heat - balance device (Thermostats) to also be used.
"
9996,"Depending on the light of light or daylight dark darkness every night, the physical growth rate and fertility of the rabbit goes down.
"
9997,"Martin D . And friends say the hare 12 - 14 hours to keep the light is best.
"
9998,"Angora rabbits, if the rabbit, but compared to other species of decreasing light wool - production has been confirmed that it increased.
"
9999,"Baby rabbits, day 1 - 4 hours of sun light to play safely on the world.
"
10000,"( E ) voice or sound : - sensitivity from the perspective of a very sensitive rabbit dhvanidekhi (Sound-sensitive) is.
"
10001,"Due to sound pollution the rabbit is scolding and its appearance remains as a result, the physical weight of the rabbit causes a deficit in the product decreased.
"
10002,"Therefore , due to nature , naturally animal animals should be kept in a safe environment.
"
10003,"2 . Kennel or home system (Housing or Caging)
"
10004,"Due to the construction of Kharo Khorus, it should be noted in the areas of water supply, storage , etc.
"
10005,"In addition to this, the environment should be arranged according to the elements , air , temperature , light , humidity and sound etc.
"
10006,"But especially when collecting grapes, special attention should be made.
"
10007,"Kennel cages to make expenditure in connection with the sample is too low - much less expensive to be, but a country like ours where possible, to make better mousetrap.
"
10008,"There are things that do not forget to forget about this issue : -
"
10009,"( A ) kharayokolagi grain - water forced himself to put in a vessel milaunupardacha.
"
10010,"( B ) baccakolagi box to be used (Nest Box) flutter forced himself to keep the law milaunupardacha place.
"
10011,"Write 0 . 75 square meters of groundwater is required.
"
10012,"( E ) Growth of the baby , spear , sowing and sour milk should be made separately.
"
10013,"( F ) A large voice is equal to the equal , it should not be kept straight in the sun in the sun.
"
10014,"Healthy immortal
"
10015,"While searching for help with nature for yoga , I have received three immortals from nature , from which I am happy.
"

10024,"Of course you might have got ridiculous , it's not a high costume food.
"
10025,"Larger price is the scientific option of dry fruits and fruits.
"
10026,"Low value is the way to obtain excessive nutrients.
"
10027,"Amrtanna sprouts as the food - chickpea , muna , munaphali , peas , soybeans, etc coincidence.

10028,"Better to eat any grains in the contact with the fire and cook it in the eyes of health and taste rather than eating it.
"
10029,"The raw grains are used when eating habits, can not leave any taste of its taste.
"
10030,"The reason for which lack of nutritious element can not easily go smoothly.
"
10031,"Today, in spite of fruit yield, spiced grains are more profitable in this sense.
"
10032,"Increase the use of spiced grains and become rich in natural health.
"
10033,"This minerals are obtained from green beans and spiced grains. ""
"
10034,"The sprouts of spiced grains have become very nutritious and nutritious.
"
10035,"When it begins to sprout a long pass to Green vitamin "" A "" and the chlorophyll begins to be developed.
"
10036,"Looking at the taste, the cereals are those who are uncomfortable if the sprouts are long.
"
10037,"Flavor and nutrition increase if any grain spots are long.
"
10038,"The following is mentioned below about the length of sprouts of major graving grains.

"
10750,"Cain's strong men went to the drowsy, but have not returned yet. ""

"
10752,"Baidyarajale said - ""Government ago 5/7 years ago, a similar disease dautari grades Noah Mahajan.
"
10753,"He sent his son to take medicine in the same place.
"
10754,"But their sons did not return.
"
10755,"So I appealed to you. ""
"
10756,"After this, Baidya sent the king to call his brave sons to the way to tell him the way to be hanged by the road.
"
10757,"The princes were also informed about the various types of miraculous things in the road to be hanged.
"
10758,"The princes also had different education skills.
"
10759,"Then the sister-in-law went to her mother and told everything.
"
10760,"She quoted this type of son and said, "" You are going to say that Nagar father.
"
10761,"So there are a variety of learning to master your brothers, sturdy, strong.

10767,"Nevertheless, it is my duty to suffer pain to heal the father's disease.
"
10768,"I will abide, yes, even my birth when she suffered humiliation of the character, but also a duty to anyone not fail.

"
10770,"Man should go to work, do not expect the fruit of the work.
"
10771,"So let me be forced to work.
"
10772,"The chance does not wait.
"
10773,"Give the chance to take advantage of the vaccine. '
"
10774,"The Queen queen felt very emotional, but also sad.
"
10775,"The duty of the son of a youngest was happier, but when he meditated on the height of his son, he was afraid.
"
10776,"But before dignity, he could not get the fear.
"
10777,"After all, he said - "" You know how to go, but how do you go ?""
"
10778,"The sister-in-law said - "" I'll take Muteju. ""
"
10779,"Mr Rani said , "" They will work hard by doing the dead Mausa Moussa's son.""
"
10780,"O God !
"
10781,"How should I leave now?
"
10782,"What kind of trouble did God have to do?
"
10783,"But the rest of the brothers could not stop at any cost.
"
10784,"Go and sit in the middle of you.
"
10785,"If you go to an empty cottage, you will not be afraid of the way and you can also reach the medicine. ""
"
10786,"The brother-in-law was glad to hear the case.

10787,"She went out to call her mother.
"
10788,"Meanwhile, on the road, but do need Pumpkin head - stuff that went to the Queen Mum to organize.
"
10789,"Shortly afterward, the old brother came along with his dead mausoleum.
"
10790,"Mum Rani was also looking for the son.
"
10791,"After both planting a plant and a vaccine, they called a cottage mantra by the secret mantra.
"
10792,"The flight also arrived.
"
10793,"After learning about the blowing and maintenance of the fly lane, the son gave birth to the son and the son of the son, who had given food to the road.
"
10794,"If both of them were flying for the destination, what their mother taught.
"
10795,"Similarly, Mahendra Pal and Mahindi Rani of Surya Palpatta, Surendra Pal Vaidhraj, went on the way to the West.
"
10796,"On the other hand, the road was too good, but after the road the forest ran.
"
10797,"Both brothers and sisters used to look at the sun's face in a deserted desert.
"
10798,"In the afternoon, there was a way of shadow.
"
10799,"Though both brothers were walking through cats , when the voice of the cloak was loud , the sound was loud.
"
10800,"After a few minutes, after taking a look, he used to walk in front of him.
"
10801,"One way in this way was the way the water was filled with water.
"
10802,"Both brothers and sisters took advice from each other and got dressed on clothes, but when found in the water, they found dust in the ground.
"
10803,"After reaching a distance, two brothers were surprised again.
"
10804,"Though the road was visible to dust, the water filled with water was poured out by both brothers and sisters.
"
10805,"Winter princesses did not see the sunlight because of the winter.
"
10806,"However, both the brothers grew up before.
"
10807,"As per the direction of Vaidhraj to take angle of east and north with jungle, Mahendra and Sardanderpal two princes went towards that direction.
"
10808,"After some, hunger and thirst had gone through both ends.
"
10809,"After evening evening, Brother Surendrapal requested brother to eat the hunger of the forest and remove the hunger.
"
10810,"He feels a lot of hungry fever because he too feels very furious.
"
10811,"After a couple of moments, both brothers and sisters started to search for the horoscope.
"
10812,"In a moment, two brothers sought to find two shemales and two after searching for a straw for eating water.
"
10813,"After reaching some, they both proceeded to see a frozen pool and proceed for drinking water.
"
10814,"Bring water to drink when talaunajikai anjulibhari were just all of a sudden "" Shitake !
"
10815,"Water dried "" voice.
"
10816,"Both sides , Mahindrapal and Surendranpal looked at the right left and left behind.
"
10817,"The water of Ajuli Bhari was also destroyed.
"
10818,"They saw water red like blood when they took water with water and water.
"
10819,"They threw the water of the flame, and both of them went on a highway, after seeing the flies flattened, they saw a pool.
"
10820,"He went to the lake and drank water and drink water to the ground.
"
10821,"After drinking water, a few brothers and sisters started to rest.
"
10822,"Until now, there was no kind of suffering in both the prince Mahendrapal and Surendrapal.
"
10823,"Since they had already received information about miraculous things on this road, there was no reason to mess.
"
10824,"After the rest of the house, two brothers left the road again.
"
10825,"On the way, suddenly the fire broke out.
"
10826,"Just one minute, they both dotted.
"
10827,"But after raising the weapon, the road became natural.
"
10828,"They proceed.
"
10829,"Uponward, the road was overflowing.
"
10830,"The highway was just a bit up, miraculously, they came back to the bottom.
"
10831,"Again, they were upset but Ferritel arrived at the altar.
"
10832,"Two brethren, unable to find this secret of mystery, were able to find out the secret.
"
10833,"They could not mount the mountain even when millions of attempts were made.
"
10834,"There was no way to go another way.
"
10835,"If they go to the fly, they have their wings or no other windows.
"
10836,"So they vilakha - strikes were.
"
10837,"There was a fierce evening while trying out.
"
10838,"Both brothers were able to get married.
"
10839,"The hungry thirst kept them persecuted.
"
10840,"They decided to sit in the evening and live in the same way.
"
10841,"The fate brother was going to the drowning so that he was very easily removed from the fly cabin by his Queen Mussa queen.
"
10842,"At the time of the time, they set the kittens that were seamless and bursted near the open water.
"
10843,"He had to eat , after some time resting, he would fly again.
"
10844,"Furry brothers were not just looking at them.
"
10845,"His mind was sharp in a kind manner.
"
10846,"At different times upon disruption - Barriers to stay himself who survived head - the same he had made the right.
"
10847,"It was not that.
"
10848,"They slept at night on the fly.
"
10849,"It was in the same bedroom that was covered.
"
10850,"The food stuff was in it.
"
10851,"Were able to travel from the sky.
"
10852,"There was no concern.
"
10853,"On the way, the fascinating brother had seen the path of burning fire in one place, but because of the fact that he had flown his flight from the very top, there was no impact on the fire.
"
10854,"It seemed as if there was water in one place.
"
10855,"The fate brother flew out of his flames over the cloud.
"
10856,"Then the brutal brother started to fly southward.
"
10857,"In the way of the south, he saw a place hanging in the branches of a tree on the top of the tree, and behold , every man was lying on the foot of a head .
"
10858,"There appear to back the animals C - Small feet were.
"
10859,"The animals were walking full of that leg.
"
10860,"Seeing this miracle, three brothers and sisters also wondered.
"
10861,"After the way of the south, the fascinating brothers went on the way to the mountain which was strangled.
"
10862,"It was seen that the thorns were also stuck.
"
10863,"There was a terrace between the pitches.
"
10864,"Kanau ( rhythm ) Kanak - Keshri's flower was very frozen.
"
10865,"The sister-in-law had put his fly in a locker's palace.
"
10866,"The ferocious brother started searching for a bit of Kanak - Kesari flower, but he could not find out.
"
10867,"And he said his mitalai "" At its root is far found that it knew , Mitjyu do ?""
"
10868,"Ort mice said - "" I need to talk not take chamdachadai worry anxiety knee ?
"
10869,"Mitjyu job done by foreigners rahibaksyos I come , "" that the way to make the swing.
"
10870,"Almost half an hour, Mussey Mitta started to extract out of Kanak - Kesheri flower.
"
10871,"Twenty-five minutes after taking out many roots, he rolled out the roots.
"
10872,"Then went to the flying cabin and sat down.
"
10873,"Both were just sitting khatma flying , around giants appeared.
"
10874,"They started shouting - "" Mussusuma Saga , Manua .
"
10875,"Now it is not possible to go away from this place. ""
"
10876,"They said so much about it.
"
10877,"The immediate brother flew the flying cabin.
"
10878,"The demons started blowing around seeing the flattering brethren so.
"
10879,"After seeing the fossil of the demons flattering, the cottage was also aired by blowing the cottage on high wind velocity.
"
10880,"Seeing the demons, the eyes became obsolete.
"
10881,"After reaching too much, both the mothers returned to breath.
"
10882,"Now they enjoy - aside talk to him.
"
10883,"When going on, a shell was seen and both the muds went down.
"
10884,"After eating at the field, then I went to the road.
"
10885,"O Mahendra and Surendra, two princes lived in the evening, and again ascended the mountain.
"
10886,"After reaching a quarter for a long time, they started suffering from hunger and thirst.
"
10887,"Some bulb - the original is found that only a walk to and fro, that all of a sudden they were phedimai down the mountain again.
"
10888,"After this, after repeatedly rising up, falling down on the ground, both the brothers had lost courage.
"
10889,"Life has to be worried about this.
"
10890,"Sometimes they remembered what Vaidhraj said - "" Those who went to the drowning have not returned yet . ""
"
10891,"Without considering the situation and the environment, things like Vaidhraj seem to be true.
"
10892,"Due to the opportunity to travel to America in short information, I am unable to report Laxim and family to my unique daughter, who is traveling to New York City.
"
10893,"Two days after I arrived in Los Angeles, I wrote a small letter by addressing my hospitable doctor Dell's address , phone number.
"
10894,"Duidinapachi sent a letter signed by a PM hotel room am - room telephone, by virtue of the red lights.
"
10895,"Curiously, I immediately go to the room of Partner Walterman , - ' Waltermen , why is the red light on my telephone's telephone ringing ? '
"
10896,"' Oh !
"
10897,"This means some news for you. '
"
10898,"From the room , I ask at the hotel's reception , - ' I am speaking from room number 207.
"
10899,"Is there any news for me ? '
"
10900,"The reception offers the answer , - ' Your ant has called Doctor Dell in Los Angeles from Los Angeles.
"
10901,"Doctor Dellley calls here from Los Angeles and has said that at the time of call ( 914 ) 3567844, call your Auto Laxman. '
"
10902,"Insert the phone number from the room.
"
10903,"Brother Ricken does not cry immediately from the New York Immune House , - ' Hello. '
"
10904,"I reply, ' hello ' to say that Brother rinchenale ' Salon brother , khamari ' says.
"
10905,"I'm delighted.

10908,"Finally , I say , - 'After coming out of work , come to New York. '
"
10909,"So I'm now back to Los Angeles Airport to visit New York.
"
10910,"The airplane that travels to the next room on this magnificent international airport, leaves a lot.
"
10911,"After all, I'm going to Jennifer F. Kennedy's international airport after five hours in Jet.
"
10912,"I leave Philipini Ms. Catherine, who came to meet the relative as a traitor in this international flight from the western coast to the eastern coast.
"
10913,"It has become very late and the entire airport lights are being covered by Diwali.
"
10914,"There is a great ambition to meet relatives in the mind, but on the other hand there is little doubt whether there will be any place in the destination.
"

11094,"Laxman saw the cake standing with pride.
"
11095,"He was angry with his eyes, and he looked like he would die there.
"
11096,"But seeing Ram's quiet blissful face, he calmly angered his favors.
"
11097,"At that time, kaikeyile said , "" Rama ! You still suffering deep trough halirahechau father.

11113,"Listen to my words !
"
11114,"You are self-reliant and self-restored.
"
11115,"What things right , it is you know.
"
11116,"And it is also good to adopt you properly.

11117,"It is not right to hurt someone else as a result of someone who forgets , is not it ?
"
11118,"The game of fate can not be known by the truth.
"
11119,"This is not a solution to the problem. ""
"
11120,"By reasoning after logic with his simple sincere love, the king tried to disturb Rama from the decision to be formed.
"
11121,"He knew that now he was coming to ask for a visit to Bananas by looking at the face of Rama standing before him.
"
11122,"Sita saw her before and called on her side.
"
11123,"He also tied the knee and sat on the side.
"
11124,"She explained that her hair extension was aggravated and it would be painful for the wild life.
"
11125,"To stay in Maiti , tell him that it is best to stay in-laws.
"
11126,"He was speaking these words in a very unfortunate affliction.
"
11127,"When the carcasses saw sight of the cake , the reins were bitter , unable to bear their sorrows within themselves.
"
11128,"At his feet , Sita said - "" O my God , my only wish is to serve only Ram.
"
11129,"This is the luck I will only get in the wild.
"
11130,"I do not want to lose this precious opportunity to live here.
"
11131,"A woman finds her service to the joy , the joy of her mother's or her in-laws house and counted the service failure.
"
11132,"There is no greater or greater joy than that.
"
11133,"Do not resist any reason or reason for my departure.
"
11134,"Send me blessings with Ram Chandra. ""
"
11135,"Dessert also knew this desire for Sita.
"
11136,"He also encouraged Caii Vado to exhort the Caucasian's ability to open some wisdom.
"
11137,"Meanwhile, the Minister of State and the women of Rajguru came around and reminded that the life of the wild would be hardened by surrounded by Sita.
"
11138,"The woman in Rajguru sacked the door to remove her resolve , "" Sita ! Nobody wants to go to the forest.
"
11139,"It is your job to comfort your husband's sad parents here.
"
11140,"You are the "" half-part "" of Ram , is not it ?
"
11141,"And this adhabhagale sitting here , he is going to make it less sad adhabhagako.
"
11142,"Earlier also , the older son , Yuvraj half because , you also have the right to rule the kingdom.
"
11143,"Because of your wife Ram , this will be the right step to you , this will be your legal duty. ""
"
11144,"At the time of sunrise Chandrasekaran whispered to some ears of cyclone birds, these gentle sweet words left Sita more painful.
"
11145,"She became so impressed that her sentence was fake.
"
11146,"At this point, Keekeyi had brought Yaki a goat of Vikkastra and Tulsi.
"
11147,"Putting these things before Ram , he said , "" You are the one who loves the king as a soul.
"
11148,"So you do not know why the Father is giving birth to his head.
"
11149,"Because of your affection, her religion is also covering as a walk.
"
11150,"He never even "" You go in the woods ,"" the word is not out.
"
11151,"So , choose one of these two steps - will you be proud of the name and dishonesty of the kingdom ?
"
11152,"Or go to the forest and bring immortality to the immigrants ?
"
11153,"Decide and work accordingly. ""
"
11154,"Ram pleased to hear what he said.
"
11155,"But these words went to show them like the sharp edges that were killed in the heart of Dashthatha.
"
11156,""" Hi ! My fate was cruel as much.
"
11157,"Even after listening to such rare words, I have to live. ""
"
11158,"- He stuck again.
"
11159,"After consciousness , remembering the words that they heard, and still stupid.
"
11160,"Ram could not see his earlier situation and such a helpless situation of his father.
"
11161,"He thought that it would be good to accept that Katyai's acceptance would be better as soon as possible.
"
11162,"Little - mother's hand for his bark garments , and the one who rented the other wrapped himself.
"
11163,"Sita fell down and stayed because it took the failings confused , her how to dress clothes , I did not know.
"
11164,"She was a very small dress.
"
11165,"Ram had already wore that dress.
"
11166,"He came to him and said something to the ear in detail.
"
11167,"Asramavasi women clothes very well , covering race, say , Sita came very embarrassed.
"
11168,"In detail, she said , "" It is not like that of our clothes. ""
"
11169,"Ram reminded him and giving him the courage to take one side "" and beaten ,"" that her own chest.
"
11170,"Seeing this, women of the palace and the syllabus caused tears of compassion.
"
11171,"At this time , Rajguru Vishisht became visible.
"
11172,"At one glance, seeing that situation, he became a stranger.
"
11173,"He found out the evil trick of Caekeyee.
"
11174,"Sita has announced that the clothes of that kind of garment should be avoided.
"
11175,"He insisted that he had asked only two boats , Rama's forest and the kingdom of Bharat only.
"
11176,"Sita , the royal fatigue , the same way to make your stay comfortable with all the necessary materials are able to go , that said.
"
11177,"Ram heard the clothes shipped to him.
"
11178,"Should I not follow my lord ?
"
11179,"When my lord lives in a forest in Yogi's garbage, is it appropriate for ladies to wear ornaments in silk and silk ?
"
11180,"What does this benefit me ?
"
11181,"By listening to this request of religious behavior, the heart of these great sages also became kind to them.
"
11182,"In sad sorrow , he said , "" Sita , you naturally come to such ideas because you are as a model of quality.
"
11183,"But according to the king's ruler , you and others should follow some principles.
"
11184,"There is a need to give some advice and caution to correct the corrupt thoughts of your mother-in-law.
"
11185,"Otherwise , today this day, your husband should be anointed by the husband.
"
11186,"This task could not be achieved because of the situation and long term commitment.
"
11187,"In return, I say that it is injustice with political view to give Bharat the throne.
"
11188,"Apart from the oldest son, nobody has the right to rule over the throne.
"
11189,"Vasistale the rajanaitikatakobarema rules - Law describes listening to Kaikeyi began to look frightened.
"
11190,"He knew that Sita would not wish for such government rule and authority.
"
11191,"Although Vastas described his part and his rights long and long , Sita did not have to pay attention to him.
"
11192,"He was expecting the opportunity to wear vaginal clothes rather than the state dressing of the Jagjag.
"
11193,"Laxman also brought that vintage clothes like Ram.
"
11194,"Ram decided not to delay it now.
"
11195,"Three people worshiped the dentist with devotion.
"
11196,"Dashirath was touched by seeing their yoga.
"
11197,"They also bowed to the cake that stood on the side.
"
11198,"They also welcomed Vishast and his wife and departed to the forest.
"
11199,"The people of Ayodhya gathered at the entrance of the palace , seeing them going into the yogi.
"
11200,"Vedana started crying.
"
11201,"How many mourning could not be lost?
"
11202,"How many sorrows started stopping their hair.
"
11203,"Rishi Ram again salute the entrance of the palace, and the people Kullu- patient , religion, maintaining some of the words of that sermon.
"
11204,"Then she donated the Brahmins to donkeys , houses and gold - ornaments and jewelery, and could not interfere with worship.
"
11205,"He prayed for the sage so that he had a valid invitation for proper events.
"
11206,"Do you advise or discipline the King that the king should take care of these people as his own children? ""
"
11207,"Hearing that on the other hand pleaded in favor of those people, these people became very sad with a broken heart.
"
11208,"Seeing that such prince was deprived of state rule, many started cutting their own chest to themselves.
"
11209,"Some have hurt their head.
"
11210,"How many earth started lamenting and lamenting.
"
11211,"Our ruler emperor has sent me to protect the forest and good.

"
11214,"His commandments , he is also happy to be happy making itself.

11215,"You can not hate the King because of my love.

11217,"After I go to the jungle , who will work for the king's happiness - they will be loved by Marinesimti.
"
11218,"Those who do what I like , those are my natural devotees.
"
11219,"Complete my will , please respect my words and make me happy.
"
11220,"My dear ones , it is natural for me to die in Mother Mausoleum.
"
11221,"Then the minister summoned Sumantra and said , "" O Sumantra , where to go to the father.
"
11222,"Make him calm down and calm down.
"
11223,"Now you have to be busy with this work. ""
"
11224,"Sumantra did not tolerate suffering , quietly had lived.
"
11225,"The tears of tears were looking straight on the cheeks.

"
11227,"Other ministers and other comrades sought to save him by calm him.
"
11228,"But they too could not stand there.
"
11229,"So they went to the palace according to the orders of Ram.

11235,"At that time, Sumantra entered the room and tried to comfort him and comfort him.

11237,"But, he recalled, and karttavyavasa Ram commands , his heartbreaking anguish ghutakaharu own drinking , tears stream down his side ually.
"
11238,"For a long time, he could not speak a word.
"
11239,"When Dashrathath opened his eyes, he saw Sumantra and started crying at his unfortunate altar, "" Ram !"" He started crying at the old minister's side.
"
11240,"Then woke up and said , "" Sumantra , Ram went to the forest, but still my life has not gone away from the body.
"
11241,"What will be the benefit of my life and stripping it from this body ? ""
"
11242,"Then some calmly said - "" Yes ! Go back soon after Ram.
"
11243,"Take a chariot to walk in a hurry.
"
11244,"My daughter-in-law is annoying to heat the sun.

11245,"As a gentleman, his foot should be faded.

11255,"Then to the natural disturbance - a surge of despair sat down and inalienable sadiyaudekhi Mr. Pashupatinath well have continued pujita
"
11256,"Nepal
"
11257,"The image of the cow has been mentioned in the days of King Anshubarma.
"
11258,"Accordingly, there is also a thought that Nepal might have been named Gaikasi.
"
11259,"According to both the publications , Nepal may have the name of the country.
"
11260,"There are tips and facts on both events.
"
11261,"Emperor Ashok
"
11262,"Lord Buddha, the Kathmandu Valley 520 e . NO . Eastward
"
11263,"Emperor Ashok also came with his family and people to propagate Buddhism after 550 years of the advent of Lord Buddha in this country .
"
11264,"The scene of terrible bloody blood in the Kaling war changed Ashok's attitude.
"
11265,"He joined Buddhism after this warfare and organized Buddhist propaganda around him.
"
11266,"Buddhism preached religion by Jatra Conference etc.
"
11267,"Emperor Ashok came to Nepal from his Patiliputra capital to preach Buddhism.
"
11268,"Come here, Ashok saw many of the denties and holy places and built Buddhist streams in this area.

11269,"The five stupa of Patan city still reminds the emperor Ashok Ashoka
"
11270,"Charumati and Devpal set up many deities of Bihar.
"
11271,"After the death of Devpal, the four-year-old Nirvana got Nirvana in Bihar, as she built as a Buddhist monk.
"
11272,"Due to the importance of Himalayas, there was a lot of politics and state change in this Valley, and again the time of King Narbhal Shah of Gorkha.
"
11273,"Cleric
"
11274,"King Yashrobarma became the first king after many years after King Anshubarma.
"
11275,"Yashworma Shah had three sons, the old prince Narhari Shah , Maine Narpati Shah , and the lower ruler.
"
11276,"These three sons had borne birth from the womb of Rani Basantavati.
"
11277,"When Sunni Narayan was drinking water with Rani Basantwati drinking water during the earliest child's pregnancy.
"
11278,"Yashwormama's personal was many coworkers that did not lack milk - curd.
"
11279,"As a result, in the courtyards of parents - father and all his appreciation to him.
"
11280,"After some time, in a winter month, Shah looked out of the window by listening to the voice of Dumruu in the fire of the house of Rajkumar Debibyashah in the morning.
"
11281,"Obviously, from where from where Jogi came from here, Dribyashah comes in front of Jogi waiting for himself.
"
11282,"Saying that monkeys should be planted on a radyo by using rice on the milk that is taking place in them, they will cook and put them in front of Jogi.
"
11283,"Since Jogi is in meditation, they expect a few moments, and they ask themselves to accept purely purified penis.
"
11284,"Jogi also sees the devotees' request and simplification, and eat it in their waiting room.
"
11285,"The slave was sitting in front of the slave to eat the food that he had cooked.
"
11286,"He was very happy when eating this
"
11287,"Make me a sweet dish.
"
11288,"Now ask me what you need.
"
11289,"I am very happy with you.
"
11290,"The request of the Prabhya Shah is to ask for the help of you.
"
11291,"The beautiful draw Jogi will put you hands on the head of Debibyashah, and you will definitely be King , if you are King of Majkot .
"
11292,"The name of Majkot will be "" Gorkha "" after the name .
"
11293,"You will always be successful.
"
11294,"Your descendants will rule for a long time.
"
11295,"Gorkhali will earn the name of Shurabir.
"
11296,"When the magistrates and their servants did not see the time of such a time, the brave monks themselves were astonished that the wonderful Jogi, like the Caliphate Mahadev, gave the blessings to be king.
"
11297,"But the king's son is king.
"
11298,"At some time, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
"
11299,"The Prabhu Shah began to clean all his weapons and clean up properly.
"
11300,"I no longer sit by and shepherd a stable , your credit before you can continue to improve and be badnai.
"
11301,"The goal is to confirm the drabyasahale there together with his reliable and valid public two four secret - thus their future goals made right.
"
11302,"It comes with a context
"
11303,"At one time Shivaji Maharaj was fighting against the Mughals.
"
11304,"One night, when Thakhi walked stupid, he entered a tip.
"
11305,"There was a Buddhist looking at the old age and asked for something to eat.
"
11306,"The woman took the pillows of the trunk in the house and put them in the leaves and placed them before the guest.
"
11307,"Shivaji was tired and hungry, because of this, Khan scolded and dipped his hand in a little bit.
"
11308,"Unknowingly, when the fingers fingered, they hardly beat the finger.
"
11309,"With the strength of winning the first smallest fortresses, their strength has grown up , each peep into a big fort and kills them.
"
11310,"This small - small forces to contain his power, Qi was very powerful in and had success.
"
11311,"Even King of Majkot, from Khadga, has become immortal in his subject.
"
11312,"Thus, when my daily situation is unnecessary, perhaps I can all support the establishment of a state of peace and stability in Rati. ""
"
11313,"At that time there were wonderful independent states in the liggings.
"
11314,"Someone does not object to anyone to race with everyone.
"
11315,"That the armor - keeps your extended well before it ran the same as the year the king of empty rajagadvima lives.
"
11316,"Everyone in this type of arrangement has agreed.
"
11317,"There is a way that will be there today as king.
"
11318,"Today's tithes , the entire liggers and the clocks are gathered together in the morning.
"
11319,"All the strongest youngsters are ready to join the races of the race on the chest to be king.
"
11320,"Like those in the hills of the streets, I thought that why Prince Debbishhi should not stand up and join him in the race.
"
11321,"Such dungeons would win the hills of race, and the hills would join their souls, joining them , running at a moment.
"
11322,"The fortified dangers hit the king's palace very well, but after all, Prince Kumar came to Nathamatham to sit in the throne.
"
11323,"Everyone called him the king
"
11324,"The same Rati Khus Bahun Muwali, who had been born from the king's Rajkajaj, was just because it was only a storm.
"
11325,"The gurkhali of this Gorkha , the future of Gurung Gorkharnath , will be worldly renowned , bearsomed in the future.
"
11326,"I am always a blessing from there forever.
"
11327,"Shah was the relentless sense of duty with all raitiharukosamaksa - path are the same
"
11328,"E . NO . 2
"
11329,"After finishing the arrangement of Ligig Maghkot, he should step down Nuwakot deeply and threw neighboring kingdoms into his Gorkha kingdom.
"
11330,"The West No. 1 . The areas are Jasmine Lamidada Salyan, five open dhhed dhading etc. Nuwakot Sadar , 4th no . I want to
"
11331,"He was counted on a skilled ruler.
"
11332,"After his short kingdom Ramasha, his son sat on the throne of Gorkha
"
11333,"Ramshah
"
11334,"Ram Shah knows what he says, because he also kept busy in service.
"
11335,"Ramshah became king and made a lot of progress in his country.
"
11336,"The king's kingdom had great respect for the cow and the Brahmin.
"
11337,"Cow stages , land laying , and road rules were made of infantry plants.
"
11338,"A set of measurements because the land law which the general public - mail was very asubista.
"
11339,"An easier way to remove this type of asubistalai if he - a bushel , bushels , red - Masha , Tola - Paula dharni bisauli more weight - jokhaharuko cell for determining the.
"
11340,"He small - middleman mamalaharukonimti the court - the court not to attend the village basaidie pancayata.
"
11341,"The place - place corner - Padheiro land - land etc. also provided arrangement.
"
11342,"That is why ""Do not go to the Gorkha justice. ""
"
11343,"The parable was from the turn of Gorkha king Ramshah, which was justified
"
11344,"King ramasahale dhalkepascat his age dambarasahalai his son took the throne goes and visits to exhibit his ranisahita secret - kajabata bahirera worship God spent his remaining life.
"
11345,"When the practitioner becomes independent of the Yoga, then he starts a new journey.
"
11346,"Inter travel is a journey to you.
"
11347,"His heart has only one perception.
"
11348,"That is , to identify with you.
"
11349,"Said his union is beginning to do the trip , the trip must walk to sustain the heart.
"
11350,"There should be no racial feelings in mind.
"
11351,"When this qualification comes in a person walking on the path of yog , it comes to the importance of stability like the Himalayas and the sea.
"
11352,"That is , yoga can not interfere with the path bighnavadhaharule Nath.
"
11353,"That situation is called ' perception ' .
"
11354,"The waves of thoughts arise like a worm rising in the sea , and again disappear.
"
11355,"This process remains strong.
"
11356,"Then a time comes, the subject becomes very subtle , the speed of ideology, which is widespread on the physical world, leads to slowdown.
"
11357,"When the person is inclined, then the attraction of the senses of the senses becomes subtle.
"
11358,"It means that the "" original visas "" of all thoughts should not be lost in this situation.
"
11359,"Therefore, this situation of meditation is called Saviaj Samadhi.
"
11360,"If the yogi dies in the condition of that tomb, he can not get rid of the cycle of death.
"
11361,"Thus, by receiving the condition of that tomb, the dead Yogi can not get salvation.
"
11362,"Because the complexity is secretly associated with the physical world and the attraction of distress.
"
11363,"After receiving the Seva Samadhi, the yogi has reached his side , his own vision or side to side.
"
11364,"This circle is safe.
"
11365,"Because birth - death cycle run completely burned waves are already.
"
11366,"In the form of self-esteem in the Yogi itself, there is a rise in the light of the Spirit as its integrity.
"
11367,"Not only the soul , or consciousness , it has been taken as a part of the vast divine or molecule completely.
"
11368,"In the yogi, the divine sense of divine soul has disappeared.
"
11369,"Thus, Yogi is the consciousness of the whole truth.
"
11370,"That same truth has been named Rithumbara.
"
11371,"Then there is a recognition of him.
"
11372,"The sum of the inner space and the outer space.
"
11373,"There is a perception , meditation and tomb.
"
11374,"If there is its identity there is a yoga.
"
11375,"Meditation and distinction
"
11376,"Thinking is a world subject.
"
11377,"It has a dual standpoint.
"
11378,"It is a process of moving out of the center of your soul or outside.
"
11379,"But meditation is a fine name of thought.
"
11380,"There is no difference between meditation.
"
11381,"This is an interval process.
"
11382,"The realizing of its own eternity remains in the center of the center of its soul .
"
11383,"Of course , he is always trapped by the ravors , fears , anxieties , and the waves of death.
"
11384,"He is free of charge.
"
11385,"This is the basic element of discrimination and meditation in meditation.
"
11386,"Meditation is a great art to know death
"
11387,"When the seeker enters the deep sleep of meditation, then the body has become fatigue.
"
11388,"The life force is swollen from Idda and Pengala pulse, and it is located in Brahmindra.
"
11389,"The whole pace of mind and sensation is endless.
"
11390,"The immortality of the body is anxiety and transformation and self-determination , or I perceive the nature, eternity , and the changing of the element .
"
11391,"At that moment, such a seeker reaches the point of death.
"
11392,"All his wounds go away and he gets the status of Buddha's man.
"
11393,"Carefully remedies of diseases
"
11394,"Yoga has tolerated tolerance and tolerance due to all the disease and considered irregular ethics.
"
11395,"If you follow the adhesive yoga firmly, there is no problem in the body.
"
11396,"The root root of all diseases is a disaster.
"
11397,"When the tomb is devastated by discrimination power, then the root root of the disease goes completely through the heat.
"
11398,"Thus, it is easy to collect the eternal power within the body and make its morality sent to the patient's body easily by focusing on the body.
"
11399,"But the above mentioned lesson should be done by Yoga experts.
"
11400,"How to meditate ?
"
11401,"The time and place of meditation should be calm.
"
11402,"At the time of the evening, especially at the time of carpentry, it should not be obstructed in magnetic and sound waves.
"
11403,"Meditation is often accompanied by a doodle.
"
11404,"Yogi wants to sit in the right to live in the skin of the deer skin and in the pitch of the dog.
"
11405,"Meditation can be considered sitting at Padmasan.
"
11406,"During the meditation many ideas can come.
"
11407,"Therefore, those ideas should be completely void by psychological operation .
"
11408,"When ideas are zero.
"
11409,"That situation is a state of meditation.
"
11410,"So the mediator who is in meditation is the first duty , control over thoughts.
"
11411,"Various measures are given below to zero the idea -
"
11412,"A ) Keeping in mind the mind of business, keeping the mind of the shepherd , and not opposing your heart , but consciously watching her speed.
"
11413,"B ) the difference in waves always inside them , they come out gradually, to give and deleted.
"
11414,"C ) Thoughts draw attention to their subjects related to their likes.
"
11415,"Be careful with the subject of your mind.
"
11416,"He does not reveal a topic.
"
11417,"He hypotheses the other subject and is also willing to take part in it.
"
11418,"After giving her a personal interest in her heart and after looking after her long-term happiness and observation of moments.
"
11419,"Look at the work of the mind again and again but not oppose it.
"
11420,"At the end of the mind, one day comes near to his master.
"
11421,"At that time his running lap has become weak.
"
11422,"The speed of the mind creates consistently.
"
11423,"Only then the seeker is worth considering any thing.
"
11424,"D ) to bring and withdraw ideas of subject matter.
"
11425,"To bring another thought, remove it and do it as a Christmas way.
"
11426,"Finally the idea is over.
"
11427,"In fact, thoughts on the person are zero.
"
11428,"And only his mind is the point of view and attention.
"
11429,"E ) Inviting ideas.
"
11430,"But to do the same thing immediately, to get rid of the ideas you have immediately.
"
11431,"Surprisingly the idea comes slowly in his movement.
"
11432,"In fact, ideas go to zero and become a person's perception and attention.
"
11433,"F ) The attention of conspiracies about which Kundalini Yoga has been described.
"
11434,"In the place , character, and color of the said cycles , the mind also comes in the form of self-control, and the person's mind is destroyed and his mind becomes worthy of attention.
"
11435,"At that time the mind does not oppose its master.
"
11436,"As a result, it can become yoga.
"
11437,"Miracles of thoughts
"
11438,"Clash Mode: Carousel Detection Monitor
"
11439,"Patanjala - Yoga 2 - 12
"
11440,"Meaning - The root of the work is disturbed , the lust or ritual generated from such work should be present and the other.
"
11441,"It is clear from what the power is from.
"
11442,"Jupiter Chaurachar was created respectively.
"
11443,"According to medical science, ideas are considered to be the brain.
"
11444,"Though ideas are very subtle, they can not be measured by gross intelligence.
"
11445,"They always remain as Wave Energy .
"
11446,"Scientifically, it is clear that micro power is more powerful than talent.
"
11447,"Micro-power can not be seen by physical eyes.
"
11448,"There are even more subtle elements in nature that we can not even see , but some can be identified by an unexpected estimate.
"
11449,"Earth water , jalabhanda fire , agnibhanda air , vayubhanda sky is subtle elements , the elements that the universe is fin-.

11450,"They are more powerful and powerful than the speed of light.
"
11451,"Their speed approximately 14 , 000 miles away 1 / 20-second lots.
"
11452,"Nobody knows about the birth and parents of Mr Sibaiba.
"
11453,"It is also understood that Baba did not care about these things.
"
11454,"However, there are some things like this.
"
11455,"The birth of Baba is born in Hyderabad, India's immediate property.
"
11456,"And he is a Muslim Faqir valyakalamai ( Sage ) kopachi it seems.
"
11457,"It has not been known that the father's mother has taken care of him or after his own death.
"
11458,"After the father's death the same direction Faqir Faqir name of the owner of one of the divine Hindu Maha - a man considered to be the master for some time to stay in the same gurusita.
"
11459,"Mr Gopala was living in the place of Swami , Salu.
"
11460,"And he was the only person who received the vision of God, not only the ultimate devotee of the Lord Dev Bankteshwar, etc. of the famous Tirupati Dham.
"
11461,"The service of such a teacher now became the only mantra and meditation of Baba.
"
11462,"Apart from the guru there was nothing else in the world for him.
"
11463,"Guru received grace only to become his only goal.
"
11464,"General - men's mercy and the Father's service as a result of a strange philosophy teaches him the embodiment thereof, for god's sake.
"
11465,"After that, Baba used to say - "" Mr. Guru is the only one.
"
11466,"I saw God from his mercy and got all the yoga accomplishments.
"
11467,"There are many powerful devotees on the earth to work for God , I am also the same. ""
"
11468,"Often, the great monastery dwells in some orbit of the pilgrimage or the dark forest or mountain mount.
"
11469,"But Sai Baba came to live in a village named Shirdi, which was not heard of a cinema name.
"
11470,"This village is in Maharashtra, India and is about 250 miles away from Bombay.
"
11471,"How do you know
"
11472,"A small place , twenty to twenty - thirty villages, only a village.
"
11473,"Very far from any cities and lack of traffic on it.
"
11474,"Because of all this, this village was often unknown to the Indian people.
"
11475,"There was no pilgrimage , neither was there any great men living there.
"
11476,"Why live in this village, Baba came , it must have some secret, but no one knows the secret.
"
11477,"It is clear that in this village Baba left his life completely and did not go anywhere far beyond the village.
"
11478,"It had to spend time in the neem's narrowing with the sun , water , winter , heat.
"
11479,"In the night, the tree was covered with thick soil and it was a cold shell.
"
11480,"And at the bottom of the same tree every day, there would be no sadness.
"
11481,"He always looked for a penny.
"
11482,"The villagers also have no specific determination for him.
"
11483,"Then a few years there, Baba suddenly disappeared.
"
11484,"No one knew where to go and what happened at that time.
"
11485,"But a few years later Baba returned to that village again.
"
11486,"An old "" queen "" of the village went to the temple to live in.
"
11487,""" Khandova "" is considered as the Shivaji form in Maharashtra.
"
11488,"Since then, his name was "" Syiba "" .
"
11489,"Nobody knows what his name was before.
"
11490,"Following his followers tried to repair the mosque several obstacles - obstacles to be removed when it is better to continue to work - as to nothing.
"
11491,"The mosque was almost like a frog.
"
11492,"The settlement was located in the mosque of Baba.
"
11493,"Muslim was supposed to read Namaz from Kaeda "" Allah - Allah "" .
"
11494,"But even Hindu lawmakers used to keep the basil monastery and the everlasting axis.
"
11495,"Someone would not have to go to the village just for a specific call and for a single lamp and for some oil and for some wait.
"
11496,"He did not matter if someone waited or not to give up.
"
11497,"He would always be able to recognize his real pure mind.
"
11498,"He had no interest with fellowship.
"
11499,"Seeing this character of Baba, most of the village villagers thought that it was "" crazy crazy "" and used to laugh.
"
11500,"How did you come ?
"
11501,"Why did you come
"
11502,"This is a diamond.
"
11503,"Who can recognize it ? ""
"
11504,"It is surprising that the villagers did not understand any such thing.
"
11505,"But can always be blind from God's power ?
"
11506,"So, a blessing came soon after returning to the wisdom of those villagers from God's mercy.
"
11507,"Their ignorance was now delayed and that sort of sequence went to this way -
"
11508,"One day, the villagers of the village declined to give oil a favor to see Baba all together.
"
11509,"The oil was very important because the mosque used to be a monkey lamp.
"
11510,"Then he filled the water again in that vessel, and poured it in water, and made that kind of water worthless.
"
11511,"The villagers who went to see the scene and shouted were shocked now.
"
11512,"Very scared
"
11513,"Immediately all of them sang at Baba's feet and asked for forgiveness.
"
11514,"Baba was also a kind of idol, and he forgave everyone and gave them some preaching and returned them to the village.
"
11515,"Since that day, the speed of the wind was spread around the wind.
"
11516,"Baba's "" court "" was also open on day.
"
11517,"No one was able to return.
"
11518,"Baba did not meet her at all.
"
11519,"Instead of doing anything else, it would have been done by daylight removal of others.
"
11520,"Any incoming person would not be able to return empty handed.
"
11521,"Baba did not return to many kinds of miracles without completing his intentions.
"
11522,"It was just a quick delay.
"
11523,"The miracle was filled with miracles in the life of Baba.
"
11524,"But wondered that his human body was found at the same time in Shirdi.
"
11525,"Often most of the great saints do not even see miracles.
"
11526,"But the Father would show - miracles .
"
11527,"Do not let people leave faith in God.
"
11528,"I want people who have such anxiety remedies may come to ask me something that I always want to give them. ""
"
11529,"From this it is understood that the Father wanted to give humans the means needed for God's way.
"
11530,"Father wanted to have devotion , knowledge and discretion for God .
"
11531,"The miracles of the Father seem to be justified in the empty man to cultivate the devotion and devotion for God.
"
11532,"While many sadhusantaharu often come only - their reputation or their benefits increase only to the elders.
"
11533,"After the demons are miracles, their power seems to be less because they can only spend from the "" amount "" earned from meditation .
"
11534,"And after spending their expenses, the power expands gradually.
"
11535,"But the father of the 70 / 80-year lifetime when stored siddhiharuko not seen a decline.
"
11536,"His immense store was always filled.
"
11537,"This can happen only to the endless men.
"
11538,"Shaitan saints are not of the saints.
"
11539,"Parents may also be seen that in spite of what Avatar parabramhako there was a supernatural knowledge and caused great publishing - man.
"
11540,"At the end of the time, the everlasting joy was being touched in the experience of the upper people, and for his worldly work only a warm part of that consciousness appeared in this public.
"
11541,"Baba looked at the brotherhood of Hindus , Muslims , Christians , Persians , Sikhs and Buddhists.
"
11542,"His motivation was to be all friendly.
"
11543,"This would also give advice.
"
11544,"No one liked him to change his religion.
"
11545,"And this would prevent a person from making such a change in order to do so wrong.
"
11546,"His experience of knowledge and penance of knowledge was unrealistic that he was the way to reach all God.
"
11547,"The perception of Gita was 100 percent of the knowledge.
"
11548,"The Hindu would be a true Hindu , a Christian Christian would teach the true Christian to be a good Muslim.
"
11549,"And all come - his religious faith was directed to look at putting another religion, reverence.
"
11550,"Religion - religion in the name of the Father hostility that they could not cope with their own living , way of life , teaching and preaching were briefly.
"
11551,"The worship of Ram Nemami of Hindus and the Sadal festival of the Jews and Muslims was celebrated with Dhumudham on the same day, in which people from both sides participated in both the heroes.
"
11552,"Even during such radical discrimination, it is necessary that Baba can be a miracle to do so.
"
11553,"Father himself had only given sermons based on his own work in life.
"
11554,"Sometimes the hollow preaching based on the things that could not be done has to be given.
"
11555,"The teachings of the Father were very simple and contemporary.
"
11556,"He had to say - do not destroy his hatred like a hateful act !
"
11557,"All the idea of , such conduct Sikh adopt.
"
11558,"Honor the woman.
"
11559,"These evidence is the form of Bhagwati.
"
11560,"Try removing your sad efforts to the poor.
"
11561,"It would have been said , remembering your dignity , not only a compassionate feeling .
"
11562,"His devotees were also impressed by listening to these.
"
11563,"Baba said - "" Where do I go ? ""
"
11564,"Even if it is my body, my one bone - bone , will fulfill your wish as you are now and will protect you.
"
11565,"From my head I am always keen on the interests of the devotees and will be my duty to bring every devotee to the stage of God.
"
11566,"I have given this work to Allah, and because of the divine commandment, I have to remain forever from this work.
"
11567,"Therefore, fear and fear of this folk and the other.
"
11568,"I never speak lies.
"
11569,"Such a grandfather, Baba promised and comforted them.
"
11570,"After E . NO . 1918 Dancing Day , at the age of about 80 , parents have to leave this male-female body.
"
11571,"His body was set to establish Krishnamurthy near the mosque only in a temple where a statue was set up.
"
11572,"This temple was constructed by the wealthy businessman of Nagpur, Saheb, to establish Krishnamurthy by obeying Baba.
"
11573,"When she told her father's father, she smiled with a lot of love and said "" Krishna ?
"
11574,"Look fine , God Almighty ! ""
"
11575,"After the demolition of the devotees, the devotees understood why Baba had said this.
"
11576,"There itself is the desire to be there itself !
"
11577,"The boutique also lovingly established Baba in the same temple with love.
"
11578,"When millions of devotees of Baba worshiped in the temple today, hundreds of truths have been experiencing the truth of the promises that are there.
"
11579,"It is beyond the hands of man to describe all the sages of Sai Baba.
"
11580,"Life was very amazing.
"
11581,"Hours had mysterious things, and there was always a dip in a supernatural joy.
"
11582,"Even though the body was seen in this folk, there were always an awareness filled with consciousness among other people.
"
11583,"War of religion
"
11584,"But finally, Prithvirayana Shah had to accept the decision and decided to attack Kirtipur.
"
11585,"After reaching there, taking along the Gorakhali army shields , swords and bowls, started looking forward to surrounded Kirtipur.
"
11586,"Local utility and the plow, from Kuta kirtipure male - narisahitako senakatarphabata Gorkhali army only after the war began to ring ghosanasvarupa waza.
"
11587,"And then, what was going on on the other hand , the army was moving forward.
"
11588,"After "" careful "" from Kirtipore, the words "" caution "" also came from the Gorkhali army .
"
11589,"Then the two were face - to - face .
"
11590,"On the other side of the Gorakhali army, Prithavarnarayan Shah appeared before the king and Kaji was seen from the other side.
"
11591,"But that could not be done today.
"
11592,"But Dhanwant has received good fortune to fight for the country, with Tendakara Narayan Shah, the King of Gorkha.
"
11593,"Let the flame go. ""
"
11594,"And Prithvi Narayan Shah, the "" front of the extent ,"" pointed out the war started on Justified together.
"
11595,"The one on the other and the other would go on to another, and the fire of fire was given.
"
11596,"During the period , the battlefield was heard throughout the universe , and the blood of the blood was opened in the tower.
"
11597,"The soldiers of both sides fell down and died.
"
11598,"Many Gorkhali rulers died.
"
11599,"The body of Kaul Pandu without the shear, almost 50 yards after the collapse, fell on the ground.
"
11600,"However, there was a sword in Kalu's hand.
"
11601,"Prithvirayana Shah was also shouting while shouting , shaving , hatred , apprehension, and fear was running with mixed temperament.
"
11602,"Then Prithvirayana Shah escaped Nuwakot nighttime without fear of fearing his fierce army before his armored army.
"
11603,"It was a golden opportunity for the history of Kirtipur.
"
11604,"The war lasted for 5 hours.
"
11605,"There is a genius called Ray.
"
11606,"Kartipur's subsequent injury
"
11607,"Due to ignoring the teachings of Kaalu, the Prithvi Narayan Shah was unable to sow.
"
11608,"Due to this, the dream of expanding the Gorkhas , which he had in his heart , covered with despair also disappointed.
"
11609,"This addition, Sunpratap Shah, called Yogi, who came from Salan, secretly called Prithvirayana Shah, comforting brother Bhagwantnath to comfort him.
"
11610,"Thus the nature of Prithvirayana Shah went well and he came to the first position.
"
11611,"Prithvirayayana Shah was very difficult to eat the loss of the defeat of Kirtipur.
"
11612,"Conversation with the vote
"
11613,"The main road of trade was also under the influence of the state of Nuwakot and Nuwakot had been in the hands of Prithavarnarayan Shah because of the financial misconduct of Kantipur.
"
11614,"So after a lot of work, Prithvirayana Shah succeeded in commerce with Kanthapur in the year of 1814 Vikram Samvat.
"
11615,"The following treaty deals between Kantipur and Gorkha were as follows :
"
11616,"A ) Use Kantipur as Gorkha and Gorkha in Kantipur.
"
11617,"B ) Sending two pieces of pure silver equal to the quantity and sharing the gold equal to the vote.
"
11618,"C ) vote regardless in both the Post and the Gorkha - his lawyer ( Messenger ) to keep.

11620,"E ) Keeping Gorkhas in Kantipur and in Kantipur in Gorkha.
"
11621,"F ) Gorkha to Kantipur, etc., to make Nuwakot going to business on the ballot etc.
"
11622,"The Approval letter of the above agreement has been as follows :
"
11623,"Five years after the date of promotion of religion does not apply for the fifth consecutive month, date of 18th day, 8 days of date shall be published. ""
"
11624,"The secret treaty of Gorkha and Kantipurwech could not be held for a long time.
"
11625,"How did the mammals mix with the Gorkhali agreement, which could not be found in Mall Mallkevich, as if it was not the mother's absence.
"
11626,"King Jayaprakash Mall of Kantipur, joined the Gorkhali and sought to harm Gorkh's business by sharing the shares of Nuwakot in Gorkha.
"
11627,"But how could this diplomacy be possible ?
"
11628,"Due to the agreement in Votan's trade, the net tanks could not be sent from time to time, as per the agreement, the Treaty of Prithvi Narayan Shah kept the business unanimously.
"
11629,"As a result, it dissolved in the trade agreement Vikram Samr 1815.
"
11630,"Due to this, the biggest damage to King Jayaprakash Mall's Kantipur.
"
11631,"He was not of mothers , nor was he of Gorkhali.
"
11632,"Prithvi Narayan Shah
"
11633,"When the battle of Prithvirayayana Shah was in Dohach, his brother Rahul Shah, with his brother, got upset.
"
11634,""" It is father to bus "" that side of the bed, bringing to them budhiyale generation and both brother - brother stayed in bed.
"
11635,"Then, "" Where did the parents come from ? ""
"
11636,"Where are you going ""
"
11637,"She asked.
"
11638,""" I am from Nuwakot and Dhanchok is the life.
"
11639,"What is the matter of mother, we are the people of King Prithvirainayana Shah , our King is trying to conquer Kirtipur.
"
11640,"So we have come to call us.
"
11641,"What to do ? ""
"
11642,"The two of them asked the brother.
"
11643,"Listening to their near and living budhiyale "" Such governance and fight for what I know, and ,"" she replied.
"
11644,""" No mother , we have heard when it comes to a lot of peaks.
"
11645,"Your bid is bitter, it's sweet to hear.
"
11646,"That's why we cried to Mother with the desire to hear the truth and the bad news. ""
"
11647,"The brother said.
"
11648,""" I have a sweet - sitho know. At first glance, and it is a practice fits. Your king is brave, but had not wise.
"
11649,"So your king must listen to the wise.
"
11650,"But do not listen to that.
"
11651,"Do not listen to Kalu's arrival Really killed your King.
"
11652,"And there are too many wild ones ? ""
"
11653,"The old man said.
"
11654,"After listening to the old age, the anger of the brother was seen red and the red light was also seen.
"
11655,"Perhaps even a old priest may feel that he is a priest and a tantrik.
"
11656,"It's a nice smile again.
"
11657,""" Yes , you all have to face our king.
"
11658,"We bring our King here. ""
"
11659,"Concerned language and voice spouse said.
"
11660,""" Will your king come to me ?""
"
11661,""" Mom comes , sure.
"
11662,"We bring ""
"
11663,""" L do not even come with , I will win this way vatai mouth. ""
"
11664,"The time was spent while doing so.
"
11665,"In the same way, the old lady's daughter-in-law gave the vessel in two stages and put them in the pistol kept in a dry blanket.
"
11666,"Then the old man said, "" Eat your father's father first. ""
"
11667,"After this the face , "" said after the brother - brother of washing hands and began to eat rice.
"
11668,"When Prithvirayayana Shah was eating the steam from the middle of the plate, brother Ruthurved Shah started eating gears from the side of the plate.
"
11669,"The old girl looking at the time she was eating, said to Prithavarnarayana Shah - "" You and your king are the same thoughts.
"
11670,"The idea of ​​that grandmother ( showing Ruthurved Shah ) might be the idea of ​​the brother's brother and brother-in-law.
"
11671,"Because eating and drinking , you eat and eat , your king also wants to win between the middle and the middle.
"
11672,"These babies should attack the front side as they swallow the vineyard on the side of the plate , so on the battle.
"
11673,"Give your advice to your king. ""
"
11674,"By listening to the guest, old man once again got upset.
"
11675,"But guests later assured.
"
11676,"During sleeping, Prithvirayayana Shah said to the old man - "" Mother, you are the priest of Bhairav, here you are.
"
11677,"After victory of Kirtipur, the valley is in my hand.
"
11678,"Then I will offer one round of the year to Bhairav.
"
11679,"Your blessings always need me. ""
"
11680,"After this, Prithvirayana Shah returned to the elders early on the next morning, giving some money to the elderly and to offer some cash to Bhairav.
"
11681,"Jethan and Sasu too are captive
"
11682,"The grandchildren of Hulchokk opened the eyes of Prithavarnarayan Shah.
"
11683,"Before the attack, the surrounding terrain upatyakamathi Kathmandu Valley - gained the right to maintain their focus on what happened.
"
11684,"Due to victory of Makwanpur, this program is not only merely Kirirtipur but also easy to conquer the valley, Prithvirayana Shah made plans for the capture of Makwanpur.
"
11685,"Due to being insulted from the marriage ceremony, the feeling of retaliation was on the face of Prithvirayana Shah's fate.
"
11686,"Vikram Samvat, on 18th of the year, on the 7th day of the month, the Gorakhha army attacked Makwanpur.
"
11687,"Diwardhan Sen ran away from fighting.
"
11688,"But his mother , wife and son captured the Gorakhali army on the capture of Nripkot.
"
11689,"And the Terai regions of the Tarkha kingdom , in the Makawanpur state and the surrounding districts, Parsa , Bara , Sarlahi, and Mahavitri were part of the Gorkha kingdom.
"
11690,"But the senseless Tulvainarayan Shah laid his bags and his mother-in-law alive.

"
12221,"According to the Bhagwati temple, the name of the village is strictly reliable even though the name of the village remains strict.
"
12222,"The construction of this temple related to the history of this district is estimated in the Middle East.
"
12223,"In the meantime, this temple was destroyed, the new temple was rebuilt on the basis of the ruins.
"
12224,"Although the temple is new, the idol inside is old.
"

"
12231,"In 1324, the rule of this dynasty was ruled out in Darut by the lord of Delhi's Muslim ruler Jasudin Tughalak.
"
12232,"Saptari also seems to have been under her control due to the victory of the King of Mukunda Sen's son Lohang Sen by winning her victory campaign from Makwanpur to Koshi.

"
12236,"Thus, Saptari Nepal has become an important part of Nepal.
"
12237,"This temple has a goddess temple.
"
12238,"It was unknown as to how this temple was established when trying to find some evidence about it.
"
12239,"There is a huge pond ahead of this temple , which is the first seaside , which must be established or even earlier.
"
12240,"There are statues in that cave and the residents of the region are described as widowed by widow Brahmin Chani Nani and Chilinil Thakur.

"
12245,"Beyond the wall of the temple, a wide range of pollution pathways have been constructed , where devotees teach Ramayana , Gita and other religious texts.
"
12246,"The original goddess of this temple is Bhagwati as a stranger.
"
12247,"In the middle of the throne there is black sandstone statue of black color.
"
12248,"The head of the famous Ranga of the statue is clearly blown on a stone.
"
12249,"The statue of the statue of the statue depends on the left side of the statue , respectively on the south , mashesh murdeni and on the right , the statue of the same color of Chamunda and Bhairavi.
"
12250,"These statues have been found there at the time of seeing the existence of the temple, which is worshiping a hereditary priesthood.
"
12251,"In the south - west corner of the temple, the original statue is a bedroom of Shivling's color.
"

"
12253,"When cleaning the pond in front of that temple, various statues of stone found in the pond are kept in the pool.
"
12254,"Tourists and guests also visit this temple to visit this area.
"
12255,"Temple worship - the text of the priests , who are coming rituals are completely pesanugata.
"
12256,"First - before the house of worship - the text of the priests, though tantric methods, insufficient knowledge of the current system of Tantric priest normal way of worship - the text is.
"
12257,"Nevertheless, the information found on the throne of the temple with a tantrika, which is worshiped by a mechanical method, is found from the priest.
"
12258,"In the Kartiki and Maghi Ekadashi, the temple has a huge fairy look.
"

"
12260,"Wrestling competition and cultural programs are also organized in addition to the attack on this fair.
"
12261,"Bhagamasta Bhagwati and other idols in that temple are made in the pure Pal Vanshi style.
"
12262,"High sample of Palavanhi idol construction style is evident from the inspection of the statues of Simmundgarh.
"
12263,"Thus, the statue of idol architecture seems to have been associated with the idols of the temple like Smurm.
"
12264,"Due to the establishment of Bhagwati Bhagwati, there has not been any evidence yet, because of this, Kimbadanti has to be present in this area.
"
12265,"The establishment of this temple is as follows:
"
12266,"He had set up his cool goddess Sarakhshwari Bhagwati in the last few days of his remaining life to spend his remaining life.
"
12267,"The village was corrupted by the lion king sakra Fri - Skara - Raut has to be considered.
"
12268,"Here are the following criteria to confirm this argument : -
"
12269,"First of all, the temple like Shakra Chhambhnam, established by Shakra Singh Dev . M . A canopy is found on the east side.
"
12270,"Second , almost 1 above that temple . 5 . M . There is also a fortified place in the village called Lalapattati.
"
12271,"The walls of the above wall are still present.
"
12272,"Before that there was a king's residence Jan - concept that also lives in this area is a king strength.
"
12273,"Thus the existence of King Shakra Singh Dev is proved to be in this area.
"
12274,"Final , but the most reliable source sculpture can be taken.
"
12275,"Mosaic , a mosaic color , image, full equality is seen in the beginning of kalakarita sakra lion statues made of this artist Dev reached there before.
"
12276,"Even though there is no reliable historical source mentioned clearly, eye-catching eyes can not be shaken.
"
12277,"Diet New , Unhealthy New : Danger New
"
12278,"As the mountainous community goes on in the influence of extermination, the tendency of eating habits is in place of change.
"
12279,"The dramatic situation of change is in the urban middle class, but the change in food habits and nutrition of the village is probably dangerous.
"
12280,"Step Arjel
"
12281,"The habit does not go soon , even on that, food habits are not going too soon.
"
12282,"What we can cultivate , how we cook, and how we eat, is the fact that Ferrin is very difficult.
"
12283,"And at this time there is a halt over the mountainous hills of the Himalayas.
"
12284,"Nutritious maize - Bhutamas have disappeared and Makaka's fascinating flowers have come to her place.
"
12285,"The sandwich and the soda filled with soda have taken place of cottage.
"
12286,"The breadth of a large quantity of dry bread is prepared.
"
12287,"And crops of crops that are brought from paddy and other outside are cultivated in the nutrition-friendly local crops in Lake Bessea.
"
12288,"But when the potato entered into a sheep's lunch from a century ago , then the influence of outer elements increased.
"
12289,"Top selling vegetables have been made in Kathmandu's vegetable market Ranchukeshwar.
"
12290,"About three million years ago, the local farmer did not know about this Kurillo.
"
12291,"Naturally, it is natural to change the habits of food in all civilization and culture.
"
12292,"But how is this change gradually, the society automatically molds it , itself .
"
12293,"This was never before ; Now - new and exhaustive cooking and eating methods have been attacked on traditional food.
"
12294,"Because of this change, how does it make a society lose opportunity, and they must always accept newborn foods.
"
12295,"For example because of the tradition of consumer protection provision of adequate social mountainous western countries unlike OK ' bread ' with hourly increase is not ready.
"
12296,"Who should say that a banana was very good in the tea bag than a piece of powdered bread in the tea ?
"
12297,"Eating of food
"
12298,"Local foods have always been balanced by the eyes of nutrition throughout the years and throughout the world.
"
12299,"This balance of food is based on the climate and environment of environment , soil fertility , irrigation, and cultural basis of society.
"
12300,"After external forces attack, the first thing is to eat balanced foods.
"
12301,"The modern packaged kittakkukuks have been replaced by cholera.
"
12302,"Instead of fresh fruit, they have only juice.
"
12303,"Sodapans used by multinational companies have taken place of freshwater water.
"
12304,"Sowing , harvesting crops full of easy-to-annapataharule traditional and paustikatale Tong.
"
12305,"The food pattern gradually comes back or planned, the society really accepts it and benefits from the new possibilities of eating.
"
12306,"Maintaining nutritious balance in the diet is an important part of traditional food.
"
12307,"At least half of the western Himalayan society is surprisingly surprising.
"
12308,"The people of village villages have not been affected even more than modern foods by stirring food items and drinking food brought by foreign aid.
"
12309,"Institutions have been unable to identify new species and new types of foods.
"
12310,"Changes to all food items are dangerous.
"
12311,"In fact, there are such substantial changes , which have been helpful to society.
"
12312,"In recent times, the use of biomass milk and vegetable ghee in Nepal is taken in an example.
"
12313,"If people can buy easy access to the public, it is also beneficial to produce cheese ( milk-made ) in the eastern country.
"
12314,"Another thing is that the interference of external foods with sudden and intense moves easily eradicate the state's nutritional status.
"
12315,"Therefore, there is a need for discretion and caution in this matter.
"
12316,"For example, based on the success of foreign experts and the success of Himachal Pradesh, horticulture officials encouraged to make apple farming in the surrounding area , but not so good.
"
12317,"And because of what they did, they never cared for local fruit like Amba.
"
12318,"Yogesh Vaidya says - "" syaubhanda guava is very adilo , it bhitabhina C . Is found, and it is also called a cholesterol control. ""
"
12319,"Modern dysfunctional European formats have followed traditional foods with a nutrition source.
"
12320,"It is especially a good source of proteins for vegetarians.
"
12321,"Still, the quantity of cough is consumed only.
"

"
12812,"Today, people have begun to burn the hill of Tarai to spend easy living from the mountains on the basis of the settlement of the settlements.
"
12813,"Migration become (Migration) problems are prone to sin today all major cities.
"
12814,"It is well-thought to imagine creating new cities rather than imagining making new houses in Kathmandu , Patan and Bhaktapur.
"
12815,"In this regard, keep in mind the following.
"
12816,"Again the hypothesis and texture does not make it eligible for additional populations.
"
12817,"( 2 ) The valley of this valley is known as the most fertile soil in the world.
"
12818,"This valley, which has such soil, supplies two percent of the total agricultural production of Nepal's food.
"
12819,"It is not fair at any cost to put land in such soil.
"
12820,"In Bhattihati alone, there will be two million people who are more than Nepal's population.
"
12821,"The minimum feature (Basic Convenience) of the law is not good.
"
12822,"( 5 ) For the same future, in urban areas, urban areas are seen in the increasingly increasing urban growth.
"
12823,"( 6 ) In any of our cities, there are more people in the house than the rich ones, because the city is built to rent more than the houses in the city.
"
12824,"Thus, the tendency to make capital of the country is invested in a wrong way.
"
12825,"More importantly, money is liquidated.
"
12826,"But the money invested in the house does not give any profit to profits.
"
12827,"Only one thing can be shared , peace in mind.
"
12828,"So if the house is added to Rs 5 lakh rupees, as it is beneficial, it will be ten years later.
"
12829,"Again the rent from home is own. ""
"
12830,"We have such a poor perception.
"
12831,"However, it disables the government's investment policy and provides money to liquidity.
"
12832,"Again, the house built once in life does not matter otherwise.
"
12833,"If sold, then it is still non-homeless.
"
12834,"So, it is not even to deal with the fact that to sell things which will not be sold and the price will be so much tomorrow.
"
12835,"( 7 ) There is no future possibility of other business in our lives.
"
12836,"Such industry owners are inclined to start selling shares.
"
12837,"Just like Yak and so on and Radheshamam.
"
12838,"If big people do not want to say that sadness , damage to government level and also stop the industry off, like West Nepali breeds.
"
12839,"On the other hand, administrative officials or employees who earn bribes or corruption, do not think that they want to invest more like a home.
"
12840,"Due to the reason, the government does not ask any employee to "" get money from where to make this house . ""
"
12841,"Therefore, such employees make a landmark house in the city and provide public facilities to their homes.
"
12842,"These houses are often built in the valley and the big cities.
"
12843,"Because of the power of these people own urban planning or Town planning to do the caring.
"
12844,"For its magnificent generation, the house made by the former family of the Panchayats Sushil Thapa, made at the land of Sagol Gupti of Kamari Temple in Kamal Pokharari.
"
12845,"Otherwise, from any of the ringroads ( Point of Ottawa, the government made by itself ) was not allowed to drive the motorway.
"
12846,"Thus, by creating an unusual home with the view of security for greater security than different personal use, a city built in the city can not be developed in a plan.
"
12847,"( 8 ) It also makes the city neutralized by not only the most rationalist.
"
12848,"Therefore, environmental pollution has risen recently and has remained steady.
"
12849,"Currently there is no winter like twenty years ago in Kathmandu, and in summer even now, the first glow is very hot.
"
12850,"Twenty years ago, in the months of winter, the stream stream of Kathmandu was wasted on the pipe pipe.
"
12851,"But this is not the case.
"
12852,"All this has recently become an accelerated development of urbanization unorganized in Kathmandu.
"
12853,"Similarly, if we knew that children and people would play paddy in Chhattisgarh twenty-six years ago, then even when the Vagamati river opened in the water, the dungplung counted.
"
12854,"( 9 ) Again the villagers have started polluting the Valley Kathmandu and establishing Bhaktapur industrial sector and establishing electricity at Bhaktapur.
"
12855,"( 10 ) Vataghat of any city in the country is not properly repaired and consumed.
"
12856,"The old temples and buildings that have been ruined by both the government and the public have not been able to do so.
"
12857,"( 13 ) countries need to feature in any of the following amounts (Minimum Convenience) s are not.
"
12858,"As pavlikavasa enough , telephone booths , bus stops , rest or post Chautari , Park used.
"
12859,"( 15 ) In the city, the rise of the aggressive and many people has started to become very busy and very frozen city.
"
12860,"The city is gallowing much faster.
"
12861,"( 16 ) The attention of the whole Nepali community is currently concentrated in Kathmandu and has kept all the tendencies to come to Kathmandu and leave their village.
"
12862,"Since then the city's pollution is increasing day-by-day.
"
12863,"This also leads to a divine dream of strong and clean air assurance.
"
12864,"In this perspective, we should pay attention to the first village development.
"
12865,"This checklist is affected by the following three basic things -
"
12866,"At this time, this valley of fertile soil will not be used.
"
12867,"Remember that today our borders and borders are open to India.
"
12868,"It is the absence of them to live and to live without permission.
"
12869,"For such a fascinating example, the land represented in the decked national Panchayat . E . Honorable Hem Bahadur Mall and Deepak Vohra are doubled nationwide.
"
12870,"In such incidents, political people were involved in such acts of violence in the country.
"
12871,"In such circumstances, when a local village seeks to start life in the city of Dijbhai, foreign citizens are benefiting from their interest in the village.
"
12872,"Even if the Nepali workers are not generous and hardworking, we get Indian workers as well as indigenous owners.
"
12873,"More than that, the Marwadi class of the city feels that the supermarket can be indoors.
"
12874,"( 17 ) People from the village and mainly in Kathmandu, people are also looking to work and work in search of work.
"
12875,"For that reason, I have also opened some of these points in the "" Unemployment "" chapter ( public declaration part 2 ) in the unemployment.
"
12876,"Generally, after a village arrives in the city, the city's windwaves have become desolate and their mind is not being cleaned.
"
12877,"It seems to be a way to solve every kind of policy and solving various natural and cultural problems.
"
12878,"Not only that, in the city of Nighi, the peak of unemployment has also begun to attract some civil terrorists and very low level businesses.
"
12879,"However , they are not clean in any way like a village.
"
12880,"Its magnificent generation can also be determined by the life of Navaraj Subedi.
"
12881,"( 18 ) After any village person comes to town, Hattat is unable to return to his village from simple life here.
"
12882,"He may have a comfortable life experience in the city, even if he is eating in the village of Uttar village, he can play on his mother's side and let him go hungry in the city.
"
12883,"He is not ready to eat the barbarians in the village.
"
12884,"He is ready to go to the village to meet the sick parents.
"
12885,"The emotional life of urban pollution premium can Centruies Nepal (Sentimental pollution) , including, we can see that.
"
12886,"But, instead of doing this, it has been a rivalry in the city of resorting to the rest of the country, making a house at the edge of the river and the valley of Vasi.
"
12887,"The city of Bhaktapur is called nude or city ​​of plateau .
"
12888,"Due to reason, the Lok Sabha and mediocracy were justified in such a place where farming can not be cultivated.
"
12889,"This process was in place since twenty years ago.
"
12890,"However, the process of fatigue which has been happening since the time of recent times has become blooming and nowadays, people are now cultivated in farming land.
"
12891,"Due to this, there has been a huge disaster on our farming land and food and nude production has gone wrong.
"
12892,"Gorkhapatra Institute
"
12893,"Privatization is not a problem solved
"
12894,"It is natural to increase interest in the public that which institution will first be privatized after the Nepali Congress government brings the proposal to privatize some institutions.
"
12895,"After this I would be privatizing the Gorkhapatra Institute in connection with this, I contacted Communications Minister Vasu Risaji.
"
12896,"In fact
"
12897,"I told him - is not it right to decide ?
"
12898,"He said with great emphasis - the democratic government has not used printing media anywhere .
"
12899,"The minister, who took the habit of showing himself a little busy job, did not listen to me - Buy a stock !
"
12900,"Let's tell the Gorkhapatra very slowly - it does not seem like me , is it necessary to do so as to others ?
"
12901,"He hindibata - you do not understand the weather - that reaction began.
"
12902,"In any democratic country, the government has not used the printing media itself - it is true.
"
12903,"But no one has said the print media as the government of the government itself, and does not say it.
"
12904,"By breaking this simple thing, this Nepali Congress is trying to trace another 9 1 years like Gorakhpapatra to prove itself democratic.
"
12905,"On the contrary, government services are waiting for two months in Gupta.
"
12906,"It does not benefit us Homa , fully-sighted decision mantrijiharuko welcomed the government should not seek to undermine.
"
12907,"The institute is fake.
"
12908,"The account is not correct.
"
12909,"No institution has been able to profit from the profit of the corporation.
"
12910,"If you want to connect a new machine, you should still keep the face of the government.
"
12911,"There are more than required staff.
"
12912,"The system is lazy.
"
12913,"Even after millions of rupees of the government, the availability is zero.
"
12914,"Considering this reason, the Gorkhapatra Institute feels the need to privatize.
"
12915,"Government responsibility - efficient management of government investment through the institution must be able to have full control.
"
12916,"If the government is unable to fulfill its obligations, the government proves disability.
"
12917,"Such a disable government can not stand in state power for long periods.
"
12918,"So the government did not have to worry about its obligations.
"
12919,"Let us consider the geographical situation of our country and consider the mindset of educated and illiterate people in the country where 80 % of illiterate citizens are citizens.
"
12920,"It's easy to say privatization.
"
12921,"As soon as privatization, sales should be opened in the company's stock market.
"
12922,"Thus, when selling shares in an open market, it can not be restricted to buy or buy it.
"
12923,"After being able to ban it, the money with which he gets a lot of shares.
"
12924,"Now everyone knows that there is more money in the market !
"
12925,"So, with more money, shares are bought more and the old and original newspaper of the country becomes a foreign community.
"
12926,"So it is futile to speak privatization by giving the supplication of democracy.
"
12927,"Instead, how can it be done on the right path ?
"
12928,"How does it control within its set limits ?
"
12929,"How can the country , the public and the government benefit ?
"
12930,"Government should take care of it.
"
12931,"Like us, in the country, the government needs the print media in addition to electronics , it does not seem to be controversial.
"
12932,"Instead, the private sector, government newspapers after the defiant behavior is - it is our biggest complaint.
"
12933,"In fact, if the government had to maintain democratic behavior, the private sector's newspapers had to help and get up.
"
12934,"This does not mean that the government is sharing money.
"
12935,"Therefore, the government can not only democracy by justifying the policy of the emerging policy.
"
12936,"9
"
12937,"Hundred days and democracy
"
12938,"The same maze is capable of staying in power for a long time, and some will get power over a short time.
"
12939,"However, the change remains at its own speed - we must accept it.
"
12940,"Citizens of any country ask for their peace security with the government of that country.
"
12941,"Service and Auspices are expected.
"
12942,"After this, the desire for mental and physical development also takes place.
"
12943,"Only those who understand these things can only use the government.
"
12944,"The government can not run only by the language of ' democracy ' .
"
12945,"Prayer Girija Prasad Koirala is 100 days.
"
12946,"It is a long time for a hundred days of conducting power.
"
12947,"If a competent person or group reaches the power, he will start giving his worthy effect on public in a few days.
"
12948,"He overwhelmed by the burden of their obligation to honeymoon or khojibhanda and ease day - night in the name of efficiency of their work begins to present evidence.
"
12949,"But the current government has not been able to take any concrete steps in the matter within this period.
"
12950,"It has not brought its economic and political program to light.
"
12951,"Right in the way, peace and security have not been able to control.
"
12952,"Not only this is a smooth run of daily administration.
"
12953,"Considering this, it was 100 days available to us.
"
12954,"Of course, there is assumed that the leaders - we started the movement to power samhalnebittikai staff , we did not receive the opportunity to show my work.
"
12955,"But it can not be said and found.
"
12956,"Because as a parent of a family, the obligation of his son does not fit on the shoulder of his son !
"
12957,"In addition to lack of control, the inflation can not even be internationalized .
"
12958,"When they reached the power in general elections, the elected leaders of the nation in a decision destiny - the line will be constructed moment we are going through.
"
12959,"Our right or wrong decision is starting our light or dark path.
"
12960,"So if you lack the ability to work Sirs Minister office - had to sacrifice, or you can take the help of qualified counselors occurred.
"
12961,"The habit of listening to the counterpart , the thinker and the intellectual.
"
12962,"All things have to be left for opposition only.
"
12963,"Many decades of use from the power side over the decade, people of this country, who have been pressed by guns and Pilates, have no longer been able to tolerate.
"
12964,"Fogatia Assurance and Kora Principles always need to have cheap food and peace security than democracy's speeches.
"
12965,"Therefore democracy is not a tool for the country and countrymen.
"
12966,"This fact did not forget the ruling leaders.
"
12967,"10
"
12968,"Not liked
"
12969,"The ministers who have reached the post of ministers have not considered themselves as a member of the government.
"
12970,"It has started to seem like a lack of administrative experience that has been advocating for years of self-interest and a group of people without capacity.
"
12971,"Ministers who have been in charge of conducting the state are ignoring their time in unnecessary work and religious tensions from morning to evening.
"
12972,"The government does not have any work to do.
"
12973,"The ministerial award is not a given item, nor the part of the parental property !
"
12974,"Rs . 48. - 68 - The difference is about 40 % .
"
12975,"Let's say friend, remembering that there should be no difference.
"
12976,"Did not hear the news of the House last week ?
"
12977,"With his alarming statement, many problems in the country begin to come in front of me.
"
12978,"The market has hit the market very quickly.
"
12979,"Today, the market is completely uncontrolled.
"
12980,"Non-profit merchants are busy to increase the prices by raising artificial deficiencies.
"
12981,"Market prices are growing as a nightclub for the night.
"
12982,"On this side, the government does not look forward to doing anything.
"
12983,"What is the reason why the actions and utterance of the work that they can not even stand for a week ?
"
12984,"Have some answers to the public ?
"
12985,"He answered the tongue and said - Do not say it now , so remember that food will not be lacked in the country until the new crop is ready !
"
12986,"It has not been able to know so much even today as much as possible to know the results of predicted and printed food.
"
12987,"Instead, with the Indian Trade Corporation, the government had reached a contract to buy 60000 tonnes of wheat and 25000 tonnes of rice.
"
12988,"This is just the pillar that stands on the side of faith.
"
12989,"To maintain it, people in power should be able to establish themselves in a more intelligent way.
"
12990,"What got the same speech or wrong in itself, proved to be preached - spread the problem can not be solved by making.
"
12991,"There is a need to eat food at the right price than the speech and statement here.
"
12992,"The market value will be determined in the ratio of public income.
"
12993,"Which of the Governments of this Government do ?
"
12994,"The current government has the answer ?
"
12995,"11
"
12996,"Dust come !

"

"

"
13062,"Farming - could do , hoe - hoe run , grass - leaf cutting , cattle - dinga , sheep - goat rearing its people, and the main work was submitted.
"
13063,"Such a simple village house - cottage living in an old woman, and the villagers of their livestock - dinga sheep - goat grass near the forest began feeding herself.
"
13064,"From this profession, he collected grain from the neighboring neighbors, he used to carry his life.
"
13065,"One day during the same cattle - goats graze in the woods when he suddenly vanadevee vision and the gift of the bunk , siddhisameta garichin received.

"
13077,"However, talent and power of Rambhavevi are unusual.
"
13078,"Often the fulfillment of women's caste is a common concept that Goddess gives immense favor.
"
13079,"We do not come from among the people - their own kind of demand as opposed to the plate to take the gift of the goddess , plates balipujasahita not necessarily offer.

"
13103,"Mandava sage curse proves that farming - the fruit of life seems to be going to the farmer's never come up speed.
"
13104,"Even today, many people do not do good things from the grain produced here.

"

"
13108,"Because of most of the blood pressure, blood pressure discomfort can come very low and may be like Shock .
"
13109,"Here are some things about what naturally can be done : -
"
13110,"( A ) The symptoms of his body - his way are.
"
13111,"If someone does a job, another effect appears.
"
13112,"He is according to his body.
"
13113,"Everyone does not have a feeling.
"
13114,"Someone got up early in the morning and bought a glass of milk. Within 3 hours the whole panoramic starts thinking and gets lost again.
"
13115,"Someone feels cold while eating this hot milk.
"
13116,"Clear in the morning to get some stomach - nut eats cherauti think.
"

"
13118,"No gua nuts ( raw nut ) eats also feel cherauti.
"
13119,"Cherauti launasakne thing or the way each man - his way is.
"
13120,"Regarding this, self-determination should be shown by the patient.
"
13121,"Once the detection is detected, pressing should be recognized.
"
13122,"If it is detected, it is very good and easy to press for a high blood pressure person.
"
13123,"Because the blood pressure on high blood pressure 3. After 4 times the pressure decreases by itself.
"
13124,"Therefore, if there is no such blood pressure on your own, it should be kept with a leaf, and after hiding the age of high blood pressure, it can be done.
"

"
13351,"1 . The status of Hindu religion and women in Vedic society
"
13352,"Early Rig Vedic society of early society ( e . E . 2000 - 1500 ) originally was based on livestock.
"
13353,"Patriarchy society development was already in the pipeline , the priest , Ganapathy , senapatijasta Men is elected positions had become the norm.
"
13354,"However, the expected growth nabhaikasakeko slaves in society because of class contradiction was intense , as a result of the existence of the state had not yet come.
"
13355,"The nature of society was republican.
"
13356,"Work was done between men and women.
"
13357,"But in Rigveda, there was a change in all these things.
"
13358,"The role of women began to decrease in social and religious work.
"
13359,"The institution of marriage became tight , purusaprati wife of loyalty led to increased demand , multi-practice arose wife.
"
13360,"Soon, the field of women started getting cautious.
"
13361,"The first Vedic people were the worshipers of the fire , the sun , the sun , the water , the vessel , the river , the jungle , the mountains , the mountains , the natural powers.
"
13362,"Now, respectively, the amount of supernatural devotion began to increase.
"
13363,"Indra , WSU more ancient gananetaharulai substituted supernatural Ganadevata.
"
13364,"Traditional high maternal goddess worship - reputation began to wane the father dominated the high gods.
"
13365,"The effect of this whole situation was naturally increasing in women's communities, and their social status and dignity gradually decreased.
"
13366,"Rgvedakalako late ( around e . E . 1500 ) from the Vedic society, slavery began to grow.
"
13367,"Vedic people started making warrior unbelievers removed as slaves - servants .
"
13368,"Vedic people also entered into the age of ailing farming.
"
13369,"In this new situation naturally, religious beliefs that were practicing drugs and controlling slaves started to be born, and this necessity also started to embrace the state of the kingdom in the society.
"
13370,"Not only that , the Uttar Vedic period ( Upanishad period ) is seen as stupid and philosophical women , like Gurgi , Matteei etc.
"
13371,"But earlier she was not like Veda Mantra, a female woman.
"
13372,"Naturally, not all the men could have been educated or not in the immediate backward society.
"
13373,"You are a song , I am the music , you are the earth , I am the sky. ""
"
13374,""" This should be my heart in my heart , this should make my heart your heart. ""
"
13375,""" We live for a hundred years , a hundred years see ... . ""
"
13376,"( Rig 8 / 3 / 27 ) and more.
"
13377,"Such statements indicate that the dignity and status of the woman is good during the instantaneous times.
"
13378,"But in many places and people there was no such trend.
"
13379,"Rig ( 10 / 145 ) on the wife's husband to love his sautaprati mantra is to reduce the read.
"
13380,"So Veda ( 10 / 15 9 ) from Queen sacile indraki lost his many glances and do not know what killed.
"
13381,"Berne ( 1 / 14 ) states that "" Yama am ready My wife is making you put the bus. ""
"
13382,"There is also a mention of widows in that time.
"
13383,"The story of Madhavati's Mahdi Bhatti also shows the same.
"
13384,"There is a single mathematician reaching many kings and walking on them, making children capable of emperor, does not consider him as a character or helper.
"
13385,"Similarly, the woman who took the stomach of others, even after having a child, would be considered pure.
"
13386,"Because it is also found in ancient texts, it is clear that this practice is widely seen in Vedic period.
"
13387,"It married women - Relationship - break ( divorce ) the rights are evident.
"
13388,"In short, in Vedic period, the situation of women seems to have fallen even worse.
"
13389,"2 . Second phase of Hindu religion: the fall of women
"
13390,"The main basis for that entire activity was the fastest development of the slave practice and hard labor based on it.
"
13391,"The same labor provided sewage to the development of agriculture , animal husbandry , diverse crafts and trade and new intellectual philosophical movement.
"
13392,"About the Shudra, the Brahmin writes "" Shudras are the servants of others and can be kept and put to them willingly , even to kill them. ""
"
13393,"Manusmitha says - "" Even if the owner leaves, Shudra can not get rid of the slavery , because slavery is the natural work of Shudra . ""
"
13394,"( 8 / 414 ) Thus, the Sudras backup group can also be used as a slave always ready status was wonderful.
"
13395,"Such a subtle and complex slave practice based on the race did not appear anywhere else in the world's history.
"

13540,"The references in Rig Veda as the Devasur Sangram are the wars in the same valley.

"
13549,"The Ramanti society could not afford to cultivate civilization in systematic society.

13550,"Since the topic is very serious, short-term discussion can only be discussed.
"
13551,"Though ideas and cultural struggles continue between the Aryans and the Rethanes, it is found that some of the Upanishads, written by Gautam Buddha, are found.
"
13552,"Today, the idea of ​​Arya Civilization is not yet left.
"
13553,"Today, the civilization found in India is Hindu civilization , which has started its beginning from the beginning of the Rigvedic period.
"
13554,"Between Arya and Hindu, I have not tried to distinguish myself.
"
13555,"Arya is the life and ideology that is found in the rigid rituals mentioned earlier before coming to contact with the Asathans of India.
"
13556,"The Aryan Lifestyle system is reflected on the codes of this magazine , such as Maiman Yajurveda and Samhodand , because the source of these codes is essentially Rigveda.
"
13557,"The 33-year-old god of Puranas has become the result of an intercourse with the Asuras, not only the Vedic origin.
"
13558,"Asur means that non-Arya represents all Indian caste and species , not only the Dravidas.
"
13559,"Rama is seen by Rama in the name of religion, rather than Ramkatha based on social history, Ram is the best , sublime and prosperous society than Ayodhya .
"
13560,"Though all of them are known as Buddha after the Indian society, its social life and values ​​are visible to non-Arya sources.
"
13561,"After the conquest of memory on Shruti and the memory of superiority , I would not deny that the accreditation of Arya tolerance can also be born.
"
13562,"Later on, non-Aryan influence increased on Indian society.
"
13563,"And there was little relation with Rigveda in various religions and afflictions of the Tantriks of Shakti sects.
"
13564,"But all of these unrealistic thoughts and flavors are found in the Indian society with power force.
"
13565,"This secret period could not be decisive.
"
13566,"In these last attempts, non-Vedic , non-Brahmin , non-Hindu effects are abundantly reflected.
"
13567,"Indian history is the history of foreign invasion in India.
"
13568,"There is a suggestion that the Indus Civilization itself was largely non-dravid and foreign.
"
13569,"And Arya's waves came from abroad.
"
13570,"Minerals get buckwheats i.e.
"
13571,"There are no proof of new entrance for 1000 years.
"
13572,"The foreign invasion that started from Alexander continued to evolve, until 1962.
"
13573,"What happened in the 9th century, all the foreign visitors from India, from the sea route, came from India, had been dissolving in Indian society.
"
13574,"The nature of the Aryan Brahmans was natural inadequate.
"
13575,"Therefore, the more Hindu Hindu civilizations should be born.
"
13576,"All these things are estimates , arguments and concepts.
"
13577,"There are no facts behind them , but the facts available are very insufficient.
"
13578,"The need for archaeological sciences of Yarnir is visible.
"
13579,"That time, in India, there has been an increase in magnitude over 30 years and in negligible Nepal.
"
13580,"This balance will be very difficult to correct the imbalance in history.
"
13581,"In the development of Hindu civilization and life system, the Republic of Nepal should have contributed significantly.
"
13582,"But to say that is simply unresolved.
"
13583,"We need proof today.
"
13584,"Dr. Leningrad . Shetkenko presented a great hank of Nepali historian and archaeologists for her short work of a short period of time.
"
13585,"We have to move ahead with this research even in the financial interest of the country.
"
13586,"Spirit of the Spirit in the End Vice President
"
13587,"The Aryan thinkers are trying to abandon the last two possible source sources and rendering that the root cause of the entire creation is ' Satta ' .
"
13588,"That talk has been seen very clearly in the talks between the evolutionist , aeronautic and the WhiteChat.
"
13589,"The Upanishad's first mantra will declare - 'The only spirit was in the beginning in this world.
"
13590,"Arco was not an investigator.
"
13591,"He thought that he would create a public. '
"
13592,"The fact that to prove is that initially it has been accepted in the Upanishads.
"
13593,"Upanishad has shown the following creation as follows :
"
13594,"The soul created three of the first three people and made them folk lumps.
"
13595,"In order to build a folklore, he took the water in the people and made a man and his various Indians and organs.
"
13596,"Its origin and its origin created fire , air , sun , direction , vegetation , moon , death, and water.
"
13597,"He welcomed the male body as ' Sutra ' meaning good shelter.
"
13598,"After solving the questions of such elements, etc., they will ask for hunger and thirst in the human body.
"
13599,"Naturally, the creation of grain from water was created to suppress the hunger.
"
13600,"After the grain was available, the grain received the man by the Apan Air ( inside the mother-in-law ) .
"
13601,"No systematic argument has been given behind this cycle.
"
13602,"One day Padmapacharya said to Shankar - Maharaj !
"
13603,"There is a lot of pilgrimage on the earth that I want to go to the pilgrims to bathe.
"
13604,"So if you give me orders to go to pilgrimage delightfully, please.
"
13605,"I will go to those pilgrims and make a bath.
"
13606,"Shankarji said Gurtha is the meaning of all the pilgrimage.
"
13607,"It is the same fruit to stay with the guru and stay in the pilgrimage.
"
13608,"Anyone who listens to the speech of the Sadducees and in the heart, is equal to all the pilgrimage baths.
"
13609,"So you have taken the fruits of all the pilgrimage by staying close to me.
"
13610,"There is no need for you to travel pilgrimage.
"
13611,"Traveling on pilgrimage must endure many kinds of suffering.
"
13612,"There is no food during the time and there is a lot of work to walk.
"
13613,"Many labor may also cause many diseases in the body.
"
13614,"Beta walking habits tend to be like chants.
"
13615,"Moments are not just a momentous moment.
"
13616,"The soul is not able to worry about the elements.
"
13617,"Because there is an endless journey in the pilgrimage.
"
13618,"It is not only the smell of pure thought.
"
13619,"It is not written in the scriptures that pilgrimage and pilgrims should visit pilgrimage.
"
13620,"When Shankarji preached Padmapadacharya in this way.
"
13621,"And Padmapad said.
"
13622,"Lord !
"
13623,"My heart has never taken away the pilgrimage.
"
13624,"You should give me permission to experience the happiness of the pilgrimage and then again in your step.
"
13625,"Although there is a lot of suffering in pilgrimage, many lands and gods are also found.
"
13626,"The virtue of the virtue is not received without sadness.
"
13627,"The pain is also the body of the body.
"
13628,"I do not have any harm on it.
"
13629,"Because Shankarji covered the pity of Padmapat, he ordered that he would travel to pilgrimage.
"
13630,"By command Padadaparaji walked on the pilgrimage and Shankar remained on the mountain.
"
13631,"A few days later, one day Shankar took care of his mother's death.
"
13632,"Now go to the maternal grandfather.
"
13633,"He also fulfills his promise.
"
13634,"Then Shankarji got there and went to Mathasam in a short time.
"
13635,"Shekharaji's mother had been waiting for a long time.
"
13636,"Mother was pleased to see the son.
"
13637,"And the mother said, son !
"
13638,"Now my last time has come.
"
13639,"Now tell me that the word which I listen to, let me break the bond of my birth and the dead world.
"
13640,"After listening to the mother's statement, Shankar said preaching the anointing spirit for a mate.
"
13641,"The book "" Sadegha Sahasriri "" is the name of Shankar that the mother had preached .
"
13642,"After Shankarji's preaching session, mothers too gave up the body.
"
13643,"Sankarajile parents cremated the body - Funeral and dasagatra form of his hand.
"
13644,"Due to the condition of giving charity and actions as per the meaning of the mother, it should be a loneliness.
"
13645,"It did not have the authority to do all these things.
"
13646,"The words that blamed Shankarji came to ears, and Shankarji cursed them that "" You will not be unrighteous, you are not against vagina.
"
13647,"Your house will die , and those who ask will not ask for your stay. ""
"
13648,"Shankar completed the promise of his mother and walked there.
"
13649,"Padmapacharya traveled along with the disciples while reaching his maternal uncle, Maa asked me with a skill and gave me all the monks food with respect.
"
13650,"The monks eat and sit in a safe place.
"
13651,"And the bishop said, that, with padmapadacaryaka What - what are the issues the book ?
"
13652,"Padmapadacharya said that the formula is of the yoke of the speaker.
"
13653,"According to uncle's request, Padmaparaji started to speak to Mama.
"
13654,"Hearing him, he showed happiness from the outer things, but he was very sad inside.
"
13655,"However, he also sad heart out - out, he praised the book for the big.
"
13656,"His mother was a great Kedendandhi Pandit and a wicked man.
"
13657,"Later, wickedness was born in his heart, and the house was burnt in his own house for the purpose of destroying them.
"
13658,"So all the books were burnt and consumed.
"
13659,"Padeshpad came back from Rameshwar.
"
13660,"Then he realized that all the books burned in a fire in a fireplace in the house of uncle.
"
13661,"My wisdom is not burnt even though I have been suffering from sadness for some time.
"
13662,"If my mind is at the same level, then we will get started again.
"
13663,"Mourning for books is useless.
"
13664,"Mama talked exactly with Bhangja.
"
13665,"And uncle thought that if the kitchen was still a book, then it would be useless if I was home.
"
13666,"So now the nephew lost wisdom - bhrastra that measure intelligence is destroyed, then this man should not be able to work.
"
13667,"As such a determination, he was also a crown of tundri ( kundruk ) as a tantrik , and wore the vessel in the meal.
"
13668,"Thus Padmapacharya's spiritual intellect consciousness came to Mulin.
"
13669,"At that place a Brahmin met him.
"
13670,"Everyone got great pleasure by listening to the news of the skillfulness of Guru Shankaracharya from the Brahmin.
"
13671,"After consulting Guruji, soon after consulting each other, they would consider removing the suffering of long-term suffering.
"
13672,"Then and all the villagers departed to Kerala.
"
13673,"In a few days, Guru Shankarkar came to visit.
"

"
13680,"Again, unclean things were cooked by unclean food and we were not allowed to know.
"
13681,"That's why our intelligence also became fierce.
"
13682,"Now the beginning of the book we begin to write, then the subtle things are not in mind.
"
13683,"Lord !
"
13684,"What kind of crime did we commit.
"
13685,"Let us command this reason.
"
13686,"Shankar said.
"
13687,"You were jealous with Suresh Saracharya.
"
13688,"He cursed that ""the texts of the orange you created will not be prevalent. ""
"
13689,"So this is the curse of his curse.
"
13690,"Now you do not regret your mind.
"
13691,"The book of the Vatican theme called Panchpadi, I will write to you.
"
13692,"The poem was written by his heart that he built the Panchipadi scripture.
"
13693,"Padmaparaji was very pleased to read the Panchpadi script written in that article.
"
13694,"Shankarji had a long time sitting in the same place.
"
13695,"The reputation of the land was spread in that country.
"
13696,"The King of Kerala also came to see Shankareki listening to his scholarship and his reputation.
"
13697,"In the stage of doubt, keeping the head, said "" Lord !
"
13698,"Raj Shiromani is my name.
"
13699,"It was your wish to see you today. ""
"
13700,"Rajshiromani was also a great poet.
"
13701,"He also made many texts and plays.
"
13702,"The questioner asked the king whether the texts you made became famous in the world.
"
13703,"The king said to God !
"
13704,"I made three verses of the drama , and when the fire reached, they burned and burned.
"
13705,"After listening to the king, Shankar read the three plays with the mouth and told the king.
"
13706,"The writings that the King himself wrote.
"
13707,"The King was surprised to hear those plays.
"
13708,"There was a feeling in the heart of the king that Shankaracharya is being a great Yogiraj.
"
13709,"So he knew my texts by Yogal.
"
13710,"Again the king prayed that God !
"
13711,"Let me write to those three texts.
"
13712,"The shooter wrote three plays to the king.
"
13713,"The King again doubts that God !
"
13714,"If I have the service to do for you, be commanded.
"
13715,"They have no right to work.
"
13716,"You also treat them with them.
"

"
13718,"Keep this Panchapatra texts accounted for by you.
"
13719,"If you always study the Panchapatra texts, your heart will be purified and peace in the soul will also be done. ""
"
13720,"According to the King's orders, he wrote the Panchipadi texts.
"
13721,"Then the king went to his home as Shankerji's order.
"
13722,"Sankarji went from there to Suddnava's king.
"
13723,"Suddhanwa King came to see Shankarjee after hearing about Shankarikar's arrival.
"
13724,"Then the king did a great deal of doubt.
"
13725,"Situated for a few days, along with Sudhunwa king, along with the disciples, he went out to Shankarji Digvijay.
"
13726,"Walking there, Murderjung Dham arrived at a short time.
"
13727,"And all the people accepted acceptance of the fact that God Almighty spoke truthlessly to all the people there.
"
13728,"Advantage Vajpayee preached that place and then went to the place where Shankarji Tulvani was named.
"
13729,"All the people of that place were worshipers of power.
"
13730,"Hearing the arrival of Shankarjee, all of the worshipers of his power gathered together and started worshiping and worshiping power and coming to his house.
"
13731,"You too accept our opinion.
"
13732,"Because there are two things in this regard and salvation.
"
13733,"There is not only the smell of your heart.
"
13734,"There is no juice in your salvation.
"
13735,"In our opinion, the first five substances consumed are the ones who love for everyone.
"
13736,"These five drinks are wine - meat - fish - money - sex are.
"
13737,"These things are the best ways of life.
"
13738,"One of them is also interconnected with each other.
"
13739,"The person who feels an empty woman without drinking alcohol and meat-feeding is that animal.
"
13740,"For her full - full joy comes.
"
13741,"Even if there is no money, all these tasks can not be completed.
"
13742,"Without eating meat all foods are equal to grass.
"
13743,"Those who want to enjoy the benefits of this public , it is right to accept power.
"
13744,"Even when we are saved, we get the power of power.
"
13745,"There also we are better - better bhogaharulai the indulgence by ourselves.
"
13746,"The power of the whole universe is power only.
"
13747,"First he was in despair as in his glory.
"
13748,"Again the power of the devotees, that power came true, that by the worship of worship, man is saved.
"
13749,"Therefore, the worshipers of power are drinking and waking up in the world.
"
13750,"Now you too accept the same power as you can never welfare without thinking without power.
"
13751,"Then the questioner asked those worshipers - who is that power ?
"
13752,"Do you have the power that is rooted ?
"
13753,"If you say it is root, it is bad to worship the root.
"
13754,"Because whatever is root, that knowledge is beyond the desires of desires.
"
13755,"The root of that image can give you fruit.
"
13756,"If you say that it will give you anxiety by striving with anxiety.
"
13757,"If it is different then that conscious form can never be done.
"
13758,"Because conscious power can never be different from the consciousness and also integral.
"
13759,"If the integral is divided, then the power of ideas, such behavior can not be broken, and different - different also can be.
"
13760,"The conscious energy differs from consciousness and how it can be integral.
"
13761,"It does not contain any illustration and can not be a form of consciousness.
"
13762,"Because you have power in the world and seen only one power.
"
13763,"You imagined that you have a statue of power.
"
13764,"Chetan Bazarayev is the universal form of a formatting pattern.
"
13765,"Living in a single place can never be able to live.
"
13766,"So your imagination is all false.
"
13767,"Again, as you imagine the power and worship of your worship, it is all against the altar.
"
13768,"It is not written in Vedas and in scriptures to worship this kind of thing, and writes to Mahabat , those who drink.
"
13769,"Those who practice behavior against the Vedas say hell.
"
13770,"Your conduct is against all the pains.
"
13771,"You can never be the master of salvation.
"
13772,"Because you can never come near the means of salvation.
"
13773,"By worshiping power, salvation is not written in the Vedas anywhere.
"
13774,"But by knowledge, only salvation has been written.
"
13775,""" Rather-wise liberation "" is not saved without knowledge .
"
13776,"This is the rule of Shruti, and then Vedas has written the worship of consciousness.
"
13777,"The worship of root power is not written anywhere.
"
13778,"The whole universe is called fiction and lies.
"
13779,"If you accept power even more than the Brahma, it is a liar.
"
13780,"So, the opinion of your power seems to be unrealized.
"
13781,"There is no power of power from the universe.

"
13987,"From ancient times, people have seen these things.
"
13988,"These arguments are found differently in the stories and concepts of various stories , fiction stories , mythology , religious texts etc.
"
13989,"For example, traditional religious beliefs can be taken.

"
13996,"They believed that some of the gods of the God of God were climbing on a small boat and stirring up the mountains.
"
13997,"Different - different kinds of culture and religious beliefs of many socaiharu will rakhneharukabica this year.
"
13998,"These were not arguments but arguments.
"
13999,"Grill astronomer Nicholas Copenhagen highlighted many facts on the ground based on the Earth's Earthly Earth, 1543.
"
14000,"Because of this, Copenhagen had to be humiliated and punished by that time's society and ruler.
"
14001,"But many subsequent evidence was confirmed by later scientific research that Copenhagen's statement and the fact that the discovery was correct.
"
14002,"Scientific hypothesis and principles of construction
"
14003,"Religious beliefs and beliefs about earth's evolution were defeated with the development of science.
"
14004,"Its place began to adopt the scientific concepts and principles of earth's creation.
"
14005,"Now many facts about the earth have come to know exactly the facts.
"
14006,"Microscope ( telescope ) to the invention and Astronomy (Astronomy) - the development of various truths regarding the factual basis of the earth to the DDCs present.
"
14007,"Even so being , the earth one universal principles regarding the origin is not already grounded.
"
14008,"It offers various ideas.
"
14009,"And , the facts and information available to the earth are still incomplete.
"
14010,"Some of the conceived hypotheses
"
14011,"He thought that the age of the earth could only be 75,000 years old.
"
14012,"German philosopher Kant and French mathematician Laplas made a statement that Buffalo was made of a solid earthquake.
"
14013,"According to them, many pieces were removed from the hot bough dough, and they became increasingly shiny and shiny.
"
14014,"These bodies started walking around the big body.
"
14015,"Thus various planets and sun became the result of.
"
14016,"This hypothesis of the convergence of the Solar System is called "" Diagnostic hypothesis "" .
"
14017,"Another hypothesis about the origin of the solar system is called "" tide hypothesis "" .
"
14018,"According to this hypothesis, while the sun is moving through the thick bough of the hay, different parts of the planet should have to be divided into some plan.
"
14019,"According to Galaxy's hypothesis, the dust in the galaxy became a sprinkled sun and then the same attraction has been believed to be different planets.
"
14020,"According to this, in the universe, the huge group of air and dust particles went down and became the sun and the various stars.
"
14021,"Over the sun, more air and dust , water, and ammonia gas collected Earth and other planets.
"
14022,"In the process, the air and dust not included in the process made satellite and meteoric.
"
14023,"According to this hypothesis, the earth was solid and cold since the beginning.
"
14024,"There were also radioactive elements in various dust dust on earth.
"
14025,"Due to the decline of these radioactive objects, the Earth started to shake up and it started to erupted with great power.
"
14026,"In the solar system , chemical structures of the planets , sun and other stars are very similar.
"
14027,"This confirms that their origin is from one object.
"
14028,"The study of the hormium and hydrogen gas found in the sun is estimated that approximately 5 billion years ago the sun must have been formed.
"
14029,"From the study of radioactive objects found on earth, Earth's age has been confirmed to be around four and a half years.
"
14030,"Thus, the origin of the Sun and the earth is estimated to be near.
"
14031,"Earth's foundation
"
14032,"There are nine planets in our solar system.
"
14033,"Earth is one of nine planets.
"
14034,"But the living environment is only available on this planet.
"
14035,"Earth's shaped surface - some above the chutti is like a spiced gutter.
"
14036,"Depending on the basis of the earth, the earth can be divided into two.
"
14037,"A . Outer circle

14038,"B . The intermediate
"
14039,"A . External board
"
14040,"The Earth is surrounded by atmosphere , water , and earthquake.
"
14041,"These three bases make the earth's outer atmosphere.
"
14042,"Atmospheric
"
14043,"The atmosphere is different types of air.
"
14044,"It originally nitrogen ( 78 . 08 %) and oxygen ( 20 . 9 4 %) is made up.
"
14045,"The excessive atmosphere of these vehicles also causes dust , pollution , substances , etc.
"
14046,"By the height of the earth and the temperature there, the atmosphere can be divided into five different layers.
"
14047,"A . The following Board ( Troposphere )
"
14048,"16 km from the surface of the earth . Min . The atmospheric level of the above is called the following board.
"
14049,"This system will be more affected by human activity.
"
14050,"B . Samatraph Mandal ( Stratosphere )
"
14051,"It is from 16 to 50 km . Min . It is spread now.
"
14052,"There is a level of ozone between 20 to 50 miles in the center of this circle - which protects the Earth's living creatures from preventing the pollution coming from the sun.
"
14053,"Atmospheric levels above this do not directly relate to the temperature balance of the earth.
"
14054,"C . Medium ( mesosphere )
"
14055,"This layer is 50 km . Min . To 82 . Min . Spread in the middle
"
14056,"D . Tapiyamandala ( thermosphere )

14059,"483 km from the surface of the earth . Min . The atomic layer above is called exosphere.
"
14060,"Hydraulic
"
14061,"Approximately 71 percent of the total area of ​​the earth is covered with water.
"
14062,"The part of the earth covered with water is called Jalmundal.
"
14063,"River - stream , lake , ocean lithosphere is made up of all of the hydrosphere 9 7 percent is covered by sea water.
"
14064,"Water is very important for life.
"
14065,"More than 60% of our body is part of water.
"
14066,"Not only this , the existence of the first living creature was also seen in water.
"
14067,"With the help of the heat of the ocean, the water of the sea flows and becomes above the sky and becomes water.
"
14068,"This water is stored in the ocean by sea.
"
14069,"Thus , water cycle keeps operating in the water by taking liquid , gas and solid form.
"
14070,"Biochemical
"
14071,"Earth's part of the living thing is called a biochemical.
"
14072,"The whole part of the atmosphere , the upper part of the upper atmosphere and atmospheric, has become a biodiversity.
"
14073,"The organisms cover micro organisms , plants and plants.
"
14074,"These organisms can be common or complex , venous or aquatic and varieties of tropical or cold areas.
"
14075,"Organisms can not be found from the palm of the sea till the Himalayas.
"
14076,"The basic unit of organisms is carbon.
"
14077,"Apart from this, oxygen , hydrogen , nitrogen, etc. also find in micro-organisms.
"
14078,"Biosphere plants producing plant (Producer) are.
"
14079,"They are based on the life of all other creatures in the food produced.
"
14080,"B . The intermediate
"
14081,"The surface of the earth and the lower level is called the inner circle.
"
14082,"Do not vaijnanikaharubica internal makeup of the earth - heresy is.
"
14083,"The final dispute of the dispute has not yet begun about solid , liquid or gas in the inner part of the earth .
"
14084,"The Earth's temperature increases by depth.
"
14085,"It is estimated that the temperature will be increased by 30 degree centimeters of kilometers.
"
14086,"Such pressure on Earth's earthquake also increases as well.
"
14087,"Earth's atmosphere can be divided into three parts :

14089,"2 . Mantal &
"
14090,"3 . Core
"
14091,"1 . Outer letter
"
14092,"The uppermost layer of the earth or the world is called the outer sheet.
"
14093,"It is originally made of leafy and ignored rocks.
"
14094,"Its soil is found on the top of it.
"
14095,"Various rocks change soil from natural and organic verbs.
"
14096,"This part contains various organisms and plants.
"
14097,"Man and whole creatures get shelter and food from this level.
"
14098,"The thickness of this paper is estimated from 8 to 40 miles.
"
14099,"The leafy rocks and granite and basalt letters are found in the vast area of ​​the earth.
"
14100,"The outer leaf of the seafront is somewhat thin.

14103,"The two-thirds of the Earth's part is in this letter.
"
14104,"Its thickness is estimated to be approximately 2900 km.
"
14105,"Generally, this letter is divided into upper and bottom manually and divided into two parts.
"
14106,"Thickness of the upper part is 50 miles [50 km] under the sea and is 80 to 120 kilometers [2 km] below the continent section.
"
14107,"Iron and magnesium silicates are found in this paper.
"
14108,"Bottom mantle is very boring.
"
14109,"It is found in more quantity of silica oxide.
"
14110,"3 . Core or center
"
14111,"The whole part of the earth is the core or center.
"
14112,"This part can also be divided into outer and outer core.
"
14113,"The chemical structure of the outer and inner core is almost the same.
"
14114,"In this letter, nickel and iron are found in more quantities.
"
14115,"Thickness of this part is estimated at around 2300 km.
"
14116,"Continental flow
"
14117,"In 1912, Germany's climate and astronomer Alfred Wagner brought the first thought that all the continents were stuck in one place.
"
14118,"The idea of ​​Vnnner was not recognized by the scientists of that time.
"
14119,"But the evidence given by Vipnner and the heritage found on earth has now been proven.
"
14120,"Wickner's idea was that the Earth's plots were similar to the pre - communal Cambridge ( pre - Cambridge ) supremacy.
"
14121,"This plot is called "" Penjia "" .
"
14122,"It surrounded the sea from around it and it was called "" penthalasa "" .
"
14123,"The plot broke out when the time consumed.
"
14124,"In the entire life of Mahabhakal ( Palazzhavik ) of 42 million years ago , the earth was clearly divided into two parts.
"
14125,"The north side of the plot was called the land of Gangawana on Angara and the south side.
"
14126,"These plots started increasing in the north direction.
"
14127,"That was about 34 million years ago, if the Antarctica distance south of Carboniferus was south, Africa arrived somewhat.
"
14128,"The plots started to drop at 5 to 10 centimeters during the year to grow north.
"
14129,"In the middle of the medieval supremacy ( Jurassic period ) the first time in the North America and Africa holidays.
"
14130,"At the end of Creteius, Grindland left the UK separately.
"
14131,"South America and Antarctica, such as Nutan ( Eosin ) , are approximately 400 million years ago.
"
14132,"According to the principle of the continental flow, the outer embryo of the earth or the earth is divided into 6 large plates.
"
14133,"These plates are : Pacific plate , Eurasia plate , American - Andhra plate , Australian or Indian plate , African plate and Antarctic plate.
"
14134,"The 6 large plates and several C - Small Plato too.
"
14135,"Each big plate covers one or two continents and large parts of the ocean.
"
14136,"All the plates of the earth are dynamic.
"
14137,"Changing the physical structure of the Plato Aeon kalpadekhi forward - backward walking.
"
14138,"Scientists agree that large plates have risen up on some parts when they stir together.
"
14139,"It is clear that even when the ocean creatures are found in the seaside of the Sagarmatha, it is sometimes under sea.
"
14140,"Scientists say , there was a tetris ocean at the Evergreen Seagoditha.
"
14141,"But from the north, the Eurasia plate and the Indian plate from south to south, it has built the seagrassa in the sea.
"
14142,"Rock
"
14143,"The surface of the earth is made from the mixture of different metals and metals.
"
14144,"All the earth-building things are rocks.
"
14145,"The clay breaks become dust only.
"
14146,"The rocks found on earth are not unconnected due to the qualities of color , size , volume , height , structure etc.
"
14147,"On the basis of a banot, the rock can be divided into the fabric , the pond and the concrete structure.
"
14148,"But the most appropriate method for classifying the rock is its foundation and the basis for construction.
"
14149,"According to this, geologists have divided the rock into 3 parts.
"
14150,"These may be : igneous rocks (Igneous rock), scaly rocks (Sedimentary rock) and change the rock (Metamorphic rock) .
"
14151,"Fire burning means fire.
"
14152,"The liquid rock ( magma ) that is taken inside the earth will become the surface of the earth, and it becomes hard and flame rock.
"
14153,"Such rocks arrive at the surface of the earth when volcanic eruptions occur.
"
14154,"About 75 percent of the rocks found on the surface of the earth are rocky rocks.
"
14155,"Good luck - Shall we grab ?
"
14156,"At present, the fashion has become a synonym of modernity.

"
14160,"Now look at the footwear seen in the beach.
"
14161,"The fiance's franchise does not seem to be fatal like alcohol or applied substance, but it has also deteriorated the society.
"
14162,"Therefore, it will be realistic to talk about it.
"
14163,"It is human nature to seek a fiction, attractive and beautiful.
"
14164,"This nature is more than someone , but in humans only.
"
14165,"It is also her right.
"
14166,"It should not be harmful.
"
14167,"But ""all over the world. ""
"
14168,"After many, medicines are also poisonous.
"
14169,"As such a phenomena, such as the phenomena, the poison reaches to the society.
"
14170,"Today , the youth's volume ( youth , young woman ) has a lot of complaints about the increase in the size of the phenomenon .
"
14171,"It looks true even when looking at the road.
"
14172,"Even in those ages, manuscripts used jewelery jewelery as well.
"
14173,"But with the change in time, changes in male sexual abuse also changed the tradition of jewelry and men were free from its unnecessary burden.
"
14174,"However , in the women's fashion, there was no change in the practice like jewelery and clothing.
"
14175,"Let's talk about the religious texts i.e.
"
14176,"In those books women are made nonsense and they are used as a model of luxury and a luxury instrument.
"
14177,"It should also be given to our Hindu texts that the women should make a fascinating task.
"
14178,"The idea that "" women's vagina grandchildren stole threads "" is a sign of good fortune. "" It is upset in our society.
"
14179,"If you look at the village house, this idea becomes more apparent.
"
14180,"The growing phase of the urban sector is also the focus of the same perception.
"
14181,"Because every current result is the result.
"
14182,"How badly the female society became so intriguing, it could not be used in the context of other change in relation to the standard singularity and marriage.
"
14183,"The idea that the woman should be beautiful and beautiful, buried in such a strong roots in a female society that she became a natural ritual.
"
14184,"This thing becomes clear from being able to use Singar's tools even if any girl starts to understand little.
"
14185,"Therefore, today's fashion "" symbol of good fortune "" is just a changed form.
"
14186,"There is no place to blame women only.
"
14187,"Why could not the men who opposed the beauty of the beauty parlor could not resist that furrying , vermilion-shaped cavitypot in marriage ?
"
14188,"Large steps can be taken even by a small step.
"
14189,"In the menstrual society, which practice does not apply to men ?
"
14190,"However, the society of men who are given responsibility for every malnutrition is only a miserable thing to be unfortunate.
"
14191,"Even in the society, the concept of Ramayana , Mahabharata's war has also been caused by women.
"
14192,"But a sensible person understands that the Ramayana is not due to a woman because of the sexual intercourse of a male like a raven.
"
14193,"Similarly, due to the Mahabharata or other warfare, there is no ego of an infinite ambitious man, not a woman.
"
14194,"That is why "" every male has a hand over the success of men, "" acknowledges the scholar.
"
14195,"But most of the intuitive and discreet squares say "" men and women are handsome in the fall and failure of menace . ""
"
14196,"But the same person quickly leads to collapse and failure , which is uncontrollable , uncontrollable , invisible, and arrogant.
"
14197,"Return to the subject.
"
14198,"These verminations , which are considered to be a fortune mark , are really symbols of weakness.
"
14199,"It has also come to be clear from the recent mass movement that has been stolen from Kausali to Melijagat district, from the full concentrated district.
"
14200,"Although it was clear that these are the signs of weakness and weakness , it was clearly clear.
"
14201,"Superstition is found in our society when females make a beautifully beautiful dance on this festival, but the birth of heaven becomes another apple.
"
14202,"What is the wonder if our societies get involved in such a superstitious tradition ?
"
14203,"Today's fashion is the result of the same blind tradition.
"
14204,"About a few years ago, an article was published in Gorkhapatra, written by a woman.
"
14205,"Which was written - "" stole Hark ( Tingle ) has to be the husband of attraction. ""
"
14206,"Attraction is natural , after having a husband, what is the fascinating attraction necessary ?
"
14207,"Why is the attraction necessary while attraction brings a problem ?
"
14208,"Due to the tremendous form of population problems, there is no attraction in husbands in today's time.
"
14209,"In urban areas, the urban women of the illiterate women are also exploited.
"
14210,"The bump must assume that the tiny mini-skirt, which is a pencil moving bean or a binding machine , is accepted with joy in the market.
"
14211,"In the name of a woman who is naturally weak, in the name of female females, such polymer , shoes , ornaments have become more weak.
"
14212,"Not only this, this dress is also insecure and costly for the woman.
"
14213,"Even though this is not going to change.
"
14214,"What can be done here now, can only be used for Nepali clothes ?
"
14215,"Does the kurusaururu or penstart have a bad smile ?
"
14216,"If this uniform arrangement has been arranged by national sentiment, why should men of women not make arrangements for the entire student to wear indigenous clothes ?
"
14217,"In this way, there may be an increase in the footwear of the girls, so that the uniform can be arranged.
"
14218,"But also for corrosion control can be made uniformity in the skin or other lungs.
"
14219,"Return to the other side of the beach.
"
14220,"More sarimathi woman's skirt ( outer ) put hindnupardacha it appears at that.
"
14221,"It is perfectly true that , their religion , culture Maintain.
"
14222,"Its domination , its identity is the same.
"
14223,"But the purpose of culture should be according to time , place and situation.
"
14224,"At every time , in every situation , when the culture is embraced in every situation, itself itself takes place .
"
14225,"Changes to other dangers left for particular and time-consuming are natural.
"
14226,"Time flow is powerful.
"
14227,"It should be accepted.
"
14228,"One side of the two compulsory aspects of the same society, goes beyond culture and religion to oppress many exploitation.
"
14229,"But the other side of the band of bound , lagamarupi stolen , grandson , puffy , fair is not ready to give up.
"
14230,"The bond is considered to be feminine, making it safe and long-term.
"
14231,"Today's pathetic condition is the reward for this.
"
14232,"It does not even appear to be surprised.
"
14233,"For stridharmale woman so overwhelmed that he's no question that why we can not how , it is not.
"
14234,"Every woman's dress , actions are filled with the desire of men.
"
14235,"Is it easy to use the whole party as favorable ?
"
14236,"As a result of any phenomena, if it is itself deadly, women do not do anything by any means.
"
14237,"Similarly, the present artist is also a Jagat.

14239,"In the name of the advertisement , some thick refineries are also ready to show rewards on our artists.
"
14240,"Whether Charlie soap or advertisement of cool fan , the advertiser gives more priority in organism and the artist accepts it.
"
14241,"Today's time is a challenge for women.
"
14242,"The time has gone too long , but the woman has not been able to step up at the speed of time.
"
14243,"Today, the women's society has come to think about how to change existing morality , rituals and blind traditions in society.
"
14244,"Even if women want and try , not even in the village, there can be a lot of changes in urban society.
"
14245,"There is no mention here that the Jammu and Jandexi addict can also be brought to the highway.

"
14435,"But when I'm Gautam !
"
14436,"I'll touch your height , Ashok !

"
14438,"Your heart shakes up !
"
14439,"How many thousands of years and vibrant hoccieka also proved to be , sangrieka proved to be !
"
14440,"A Buddha , Ashoka , Gandhi is in the context of advancing the primitive nature .
"
14441,"It is not our heart to say that we are your ancestors and you are your children.
"
14442,"So, by keeping the Buddha in the chest, we will only kill the goddess and weigh the axis of om man.
"
14443,"Ashok, who is mentioned in the same flag, talks with Awaas, and we are looking for the cannon and missile to bring peace after the conquest.
"
14444,"In India , you are not Alexander , you are not mihiragula , you are not Mohammad Ghaznavi.
"
14445,"The country is an invasion of the invasion of Alexander , the attack of Hanuman , the terror of the Timur line , and Shahabuddin , Al- Qaeda , and then the British.
"
14446,"You have the experience of self-determination.
"
14447,"You are free now
"
14448,"Nepal , you are not going to go.
"
14449,"But you know that how painful it is to suffer from the tremendous flavor of dogs , sheltered shelters , which are being born in itself.
"
14450,"Still, you remained free.
"
14451,"Well , let me be proud that sadness !
"
14452,"India's illusion is not the luck !
"
14453,"You shrugged
"
14454,"Friends tell the truth, the truth !
"
14455,"I did not patyaekai , you are out is so decidedly well.
"
14456,"I did not think you would kill me.
"
14457,"I did not imagine you can go down too much.
"
14458,"Because you see, I have Ashok , Mahavira, I have to see , Gandhi, I have to find.
"
14459,"Where can I be unbelievable by blaming them ?
"
14460,"Even Gandhi still walks there on the air.
"
14461,"Mahavira still speaks to the people there.
"
14462,"Ashok still remains in the heart of there.
"
14463,"But you could not believe when you looked at the border locking the border, it's a pedestrian Ashoka's step !
"
14464,"I understand that in our context, it tells me a good message in the direction of change , indicating the future of Colto !
"
14465,"Friend , you should be blessed with the freedom fighters of your country !
"
14466,"It may have been hard to create a favorable situation by troubling the troubles of solving problems.
"
14467,"But how many unbelievers choose friends !
"
14468,"Will my arrogance be seen and you are fire and forget the tolerance of Gandhi ?
"
14469,"Is my behavior so tiny and you shout and forget Mahavira's message ?
"
14470,"Am I so unbelievable and you will be afraid and keep Ashoka out of control ?
"
14471,"Believe Nepal, it has already erupted the gulf.
"
14472,"Now do not believe the gun , hand Buddha santipatra ( gulapah ) and is the bodhi tree branches.
"
14473,"He is not hot in the thirst , if the hunger of the Himalayan shadow is awakened, then yes.
"
14474,"In fact, some khukuri is light and the gun knives , but instead of looking for our chest , no border can be touched.
"
14475,"What do I say in context ?
"
14476,"The decision came from the gun and bandukale problems , solutions are sustainable and how people lived without the rest of rebellion ?
"
14477,"Missiles and molecasts do not even believe the true omnipresent , but it is seen in Korea , Vietnam , Cambodia , Lebanon , Afghanistan.
"
14478,"It is known that there will be a small molecule for it.
"
14479,"But after looking back to Russia and America, we are unbelievers - their beliefs , self-esteem , beliefs , presentations , and emotions !
"
14480,"Where are the countrymen who can bury the peacock of blood for one piece of soil and I bow down the head before the weapon , and take a bath on the front of the blockade ?
"
14481,"However , I wish you , Ashoka !
"
14482,"Your India too.
"
14483,"To get up, the ground needs to be needed : How funny does anyone say when I wake up on the sky ?
"
14484,"I am still tired of the sky , speaking in the air and in drowsiness.
"
14485,"I thought of being the Sagittarius, on the foot of Phulchowo.
"
14486,"What I say is that you are screaming !
"
14487,"Where are the fifty-meter meters of marijuana running around , and there is also a panoramic yard !
"
14488,"I am there where the corner started to walk.
"
14489,"I happen to like the bhaidiechu that was yesterday , the day before I was.
"
14490,"My roads I proud of !
"
14491,"My Bands I Have Pleasure !
"
14492,"My Industries I Relied !
"
14493,"My achievements I have won !
"
14494,"You are not the road , I do not say , there is no industry , I do not say and there is no achievement.
"
14495,"Of course , such as comforting awards , singing and drinking and prayers for the peace of the dead.
"
14496,"Oh !
"
14497,"Pride with others has to be proud of you.
"
14498,"It does not mean that you can walk.
"
14499,"Why are you so frustrated ?
"
14500,"My achievements !
"
14501,"Look at what you 're thinking slowly ?
"
14502,"I have born someone.
"
14503,"Somebody woke up I got up.
"
14504,"Someone walked away.
"
14505,"Is not this that you , squeezing me and all of us ?
"
14506,"So if anyone sees me, do not think that I hate him.
"
14507,"How often do I have to respect someone else ?
"
14508,"At times, can it sometimes be fierce in practice ? What can it say to the question of dignity ?
"
14509,"Can anyone say no more intolerant, and no one can seduce anyone ?
"
14510,"Where can the little thing be said in the contaminated air of immunization, and where there is no risk for walking steps ?
"
14511,"It is so good for you.
"
14512,"It's so good for me.
"
14513,"Therefore, there is also a disease in the pharmaceutical medicine that causes diseases and doubts, and this risk rises to risk.
"
14514,"My friend !
"
14515,"And fritters grow thorns in my life and know how deep I am.
"
14516,"And after taking a line of limbs and getting two liters of oil, I am preparing to stir up the fat and stir up the fat and stirring it into the neck !
"
14517,"Yes , you do not say that there is no pain in the steps taken.
"
14518,"But I am seeing a warm future there.
"
14519,"I am seeing today's dry path of life and rising up.
"
14520,"Is there any sunrise ?
"
14521,"Where is the facility uplifting the country ?
"
14522,"Where did I wake up and talk about the future ?
"
14523,"Mercy - The development of donations can not be ascertained by the development that even corners , small airs are also inconvenient to terrorize.
"
14524,"The velocity is too early , it's up to a snake.
"
14525,"Oh , so far away, I have come to see how far the dream is , Oh !
"
14526,"My Nepal !
"
14527,"You bamcis agony , you always bamcis steam vapor , you always distracted the bamcisa nakhiyaikana , you risk irritating the bamcis no.
"
14528,"Is that still the way to survive ?
"
14529,"The country that never has to bear the risk !
"
14530,"The country that never had any trouble in history !
"
14531,"The country that never has an end !
"
14532,"Tell me what is happier than this, and do not appreciate your fate ?
"
14533,"Perhaps this is what happened could curse that somehow , do not you do not you uklanchas jharchas.
"
14534,"Humility does not eat people weak , poor country is weak.
"
14535,"Why are you not able to do so ?
"
14536,"And even the dry ground floor will give you a date.
"
14537,"The tribal people of Nepal are political , social , economic , educational , and administrative.
"
14538,"What are the causes behind these tribesmen ?
"
14539,"Is the society behind the culture and the culture behind it ?
"
14540,"The reasons for this are to be considered analytically as I think.
"
14541,"Analysis of this analysis should be taken from the time of integration of Nepal.
"
14542,"Current land - part of what was the history ekikaranabhandapahila.
"
14543,"22 / 24 states that caste were kings , they rise and fall of states, how ?
"
14544,"At that time , how was the different aspects of the Mongolian tribe like language , culture, social status ?
"
14545,"Nepal's current history is silent about these incidents, when we read the history of other countries thousands of years ago.
"
14546,"The civilization of Mohanodaddo , the ancient civilization of Egypt is a history of thousands of years ago.
"
14547,"But 250 years ago, Nepal's various land - part of why we read history and ties, paudainaum ?
"
14548,"Have historians of Nepal been compelled to write any power.
"
14549,"The writers of Nepal have not been able to write.
"
14550,"Do historians of Nepal try to certify this ?
"
14551,"Past Nepalese rulers were related only to the specialists.
"
14552,"The dam vision - angle with the ethnic Mongolian history and culture try to get rid of the money.
"
14553,"Therefore, it is difficult to analyze with the incident of the integration before integration.
"
14554,"The reasons behind the integration of tribal tribes of Nepal are in my view as follows.
"
14555,"1 ) Ethnic division by giving protection to religious and legal beliefs based on Hindu philosophy.
"
14556,"2 ) The lack of language and scripts.
"
14557,"3 ) Fall of inspirational history and culture.
"
14558,"4 ) Disaster of creative power from foreign military service.
"
14559,"5 ) Neglected view of statehood for tribal people.
"
14560,"The Hindu philosophy is considered to be a developed and ancient philosophy of the world.
"
14561,"But this vision is divided into four folds of inner human being, the weakness of this vision is a drop.
"
14562,"Deputation of state power is fundamentalism of Hinduism.
"
14563,"Due to that, the philosophy of Hindu philosophy remains alive.
"
14564,"After the occupation of the Magol rulers in India, Aryan Gaurus, who developed this developed Hindu, entered Nepal and west in Nepal.
"
14565,"This view of Mangal tribesmen of Nepal separated from the same time when the water was cleaned.
"
14566,"After the integration of Nepal, the legitoes made by religious accreditation to Hindu philosophy were protected and it was ignored by Mangal tribesmen.
"
14567,"During the 104-year Ranaasan period, it reached extreme levels.
"
14568,"After the integration, ethnicity of Hindu culture was increasing in state power.
"
14569,"In the Rajasthan, these tribesmen did not have any disadvantages and disadvantages.
"
14570,"Since then, the effect of Mongol knowledge was decreasing.
"
14571,"Buddha's philosophy is more effective than the religions of the world, and this religion has treated human beings as equality.
"
14572,"Although Nepal Mongolian ethnic language, culture diversity , rituals custom , fake and found the same level of culture.
"
14573,"Buddha's vision matches more with the ideals.
"
14574,"Therefore the culture of tribal tribalism was neglected from the state.
"
14575,"The influential people of this tribe have been pushing others on the fundamental culture by henceforth ethnic differences in Hindu philosophy.
"
14576,"The religious belief of Hindu philosophy was considered to be only two states in Nepal and India, entitled to statesmen.
"
14577,"The policy rules arranged based on this philosophy recognized the low level of net population and water drainage.
"
14578,"These beliefs came to the end of 2007 years directly after consolidation of state power.
"
14579,"These years are not directly valid until 2007.
"
14580,"But, since the power of state power is transferred from that recognized culture, it can not be said indirectly.
"
14581,"Regarding the reign of Ran Bahadur Shah, the writers were sentenced to death.
"
14582,"It was a time-long campaign for today's time.
"
14583,"The 62-year-old Bista Hath has got a place in history.
"
14584,"The 62-year-old voter's reign during Veerash Kashar's rule has seen such opportunity as the Hindu philosophy in the state's power.
"
14585,"It took a little bit over the 104-year-old regime.
"
14586,"Bela's rulers a . B . C . Divided into three levels.
"
14587,"A . And b . The level of the children was considered as the Honorable King of the King 3 and Prime Minister.
"
14588,"Which was born from a spacious region or a bridegroom.
"
14589,"The lower level was considered neglected.
"
14590,"Born from the mother of three people of Janjati . Class rulers brought a great deal of support for bringing democracy to the 2007 year revolution with financial , intellectual support.
"
14591,"Mahavir Shamsher , Suvron Shamsher , Rudra Shamsher etc.
"
14592,"Since the Mongol people ignored religious and legal beliefs, there was no negative recognition in the administration.
"
14593,"Because of this, the people of the country, who were specially admitted to administrative and religious levels, were victims of the exploitation of the feudal imperialists.
"
14594,"Neither religion nor ethnic Mongol hitakonimti law , not administrative appropriate person , nor culture, as well as lamps.
"
14595,"Chakrabuuh was created from all over the exploitation.
"
14596,"Its effect has not been removed from our mental , social rituals till today .
"
14597,"Due to the dominance of Hindu philosophy in the center of politics and the neglected view of the Mongolian culture, Mangal tribesmen also gave their sultan to the culture.
"
14598,"Thus, through the Hindu religion, 4 level ethnic beliefs were found and legitimately supported that belief, the original culture was ignored here.
"
14599,"It's a matter of research.
"
14600,"At the time of Mahabharata, Arjun came to Nepal and confessed to the battlefield of Mahat Bharatiya Janata Party and proved to have been a warrior in the battle of Mahabharata, after receiving livelihood and fortune training.
"
14601,"But it is a fact that these tribal people of Nepal were called to ""get rent "" .
"
14602,"When you use a new language and culture, it becomes self-sufficient to automatically follow once again.
"
14603,"Thus, due to lack of their original language and scriptures, these tribesmen suffered administrative neglect.
"
14604,"The English language and script was developed thousands of years ago.
"
14605,"And its empire spread to the world too.
"
14606,"Though British rule left in India, English language domination has not left.
"
14607,"Since the language and religion received protection from the state government, the neglected behavior of other languages ​​and tribal people had to be done automatically.
"
14608,"Thus, the language of fundamental genocide appears to be scripts.
"
14609,"Even in the 250 years of unified Nepal, there is a language and other important reason for scriptures not to accommodate 2 % in Magolaj tribal administration .
"
14610,"Keeping language and script-oriented approaches, Nepali language does not have to be a negative attitude before the first fall.
"
14611,"Nepali language is a national language and medium.
"
14612,"Depression of compression does not allow the language to speak based on language and language.
"
14613,"But by constitutional accreditation, today it is necessary to develop and protect these languages ​​and culture.
"
14614,"This voice was brought after the poll.
"
14615,"It's important to take care of it.
"
14616,"Official approaches are positive based on our voice.
"
14617,"Then only the very neglected Nepal of Orginal Nationality comes to be an important component.
"
14618,"But, if the Nepali speaking language of Nepal does not behave like a similar legal recognition, then it will not be usable.
"
14619,"This voice should be more focused on the support of other groups.
"
14620,"The lack of inspirational history and culture : -
"
14621,"People of any country are raised by that country or the history and culture of the world.
"
14622,"DR. Sun Yat-Sen's inspiration raised the morale of Maoists and Chinese people.
"
14623,"Mahatma Gandhi's actions arose Indian people.
"
14624,"After the integration of Nepal, the history and cultures of this tribe were not covered, because they did not have the motivation and encouragement.
"
14625,"According to Bhanwakak , the Nepalese people had united the same as Nepal Narayan Shah , so that the people had promoted the language.
"
14626,"He was a tears poet.
"
14627,"The ruler of that time struggled with the ruling, but the language that is united by the language is wrong.
"
14628,"It was only the first time that the Nepali language was spoken to be more common than the Bhunbhavas.
"
14629,"Which has not been written and investigated.
"
14630,"In the first radical world war, many Mongol tribes spread the highest rank of English (V. C) throughout India, respecting the kingdom of India.
"
14631,"But they (VC) will bahaduraharulai (Nepal) 5 to the Government of Sri dignity alone bamboo clothing javosa jivikakako not batosamma.
"
14632,"We do not have to go in favor of that tradition yet.
"
14633,"Likewise , only photographs of conscious writers , historians , social and political leaders are found in the postponement of postal tickets .
"
14634,"Why can not the pictures of brave Nepalese recipients (V. C) be found in the postal ticket or other special features?
"
14635,"This is the cultural difference of Nepal itself , all of these reasons are neglected negative views for the population and culture of native people.
"
14636,"In Nepal's history or in literature, in religious or administrative matters , these tribesmen do not have to give self- inspiration , inspiration and keenness.
"
14637,"Nearly 2000 Wighi land has been occupied in the dangers of the heavenly Gupti of Puthan.
"
14638,"This opportunity has been just a hundred years ago.
"
14639,"Similarly, some of the land revenue in Terai districts around the Lumbini Zone 9/10 million endowments, institutions deposit declaration.
"
14640,"Can ordinary Nepali raise money from the Grapes of the Gutty collected in the dungeon space ?
"
14641,"Thus, history of history and culture of the population has been stroke through one's ethnic ethnic culture and history.
"
14642,"Hierarchy of power by foreign military profession : -
"
14643,"After the Treaty of Sugouli, Mongol tribes became indigenous in the Gorkha army of India.
"
14644,"Fighting for combatants was defeated by combatants.
"
14645,"Nepal's power is limited.
"
14646,"It was not a sequence before Nepal integration.
"
14647,"Only after being neglected from the ruling party, this culture has become foreign.
"
14648,"In India , the number of Nepalese exile in the British Gorkha region is visible , but Magar , Gurung Rai Limbu , Tamang appears.
"
14649,"Nepalese foreigners who did not post over the superiority did not get opportunity to learn higher psychology , administration , academic art , technical , knowledge , and nothing.
"
14650,"Only learning that attacking dictatorships by teaching their minds and desires.
"
14651,"The returns of discretionary power are not exactly the way to show inspirational ways to their children.
"
14652,"That reason, it was naturally easy to push these tribal culture into a beauty sip and lack of art.
"
14653,"The quantities of Bishmishar came and expanded its quantities.
"
14654,"Nowadays, in India and in the UK, Gorkhha regiments should have been given a pseudonia conspiracy after getting less facilities and opportunities than the citizens of their country.
"
14655,"Jhapa
"
14656,"After Jhapa fall
"
14657,"After throwing the bench to Kathmandu, I dried up Jhapa.
"
14658,"Q kandapachi campus. Zi. A. Not even
"
14659,"Riot, assault, vandalism were common at that time.
"
14660,"In order to remain absolute in the movement, there was a fear to save the same life.
"
14661,"A teacher woke up and puts a paper in front of me.
"
14662,"""What's wrong with the Master Saheb? '
"
14663,""" O my God , give me a break from the school and take it out of school. ""

14670,"We recommend other things. ""
"
14671,"After a while, the police comes with a snack -

14672,"The double scalp has stopped biting.
"
14673,"Immediately, the police are sent , but those who are not found are found.

14677,"The team is dispatched with local leaders.
"
14678,"Despite similar problems , local workers , journalists and intellectuals received good support because the problems were in a hurry.
"
14679,"At this time, only 12 days after staying in Jhapa, I look forward to turning to Morang.

"
14689,"I cheered from the brief DR. Said the situation.
"
14690,""" Come in ten minutes , but keep the staff inside. ""

"
14696,"DR. Kusturi Malala, who was brought to death by the doctor, had made the doctor a model for the procession.
"
14697,"Until then, there was a stance of not knowing the dead and the child.
"
14698,"The baby is placed in the incubator.
"
14699,"Emergency patients were discharged and the emergency also stopped.
"
14700,"We are talking , do not leave the hospital even if you are talking - that patients are kept stopping.

14824,"The staff used to rebel , but Communist never took the name of his minister.
"
14825,"There were few Congressmen who understood such commissions made by the Communist presented at the forced force in the movement and made political views.
"

15149,"Exclusively there were regular tasks that I had to run twice in the month of television and radio program.
"
15150,"The ' Apparel ' quarterly edit was required and the ' social service news ' was to be used monthly.
"
15151,"I was also the founder editor of this newspaper.
"
15152,"But all these programs were closed after I walked.
"
15153,"Radio and TV . Too . The program stopped coming from.
"
15154,"The magazine also closed.
"
15155,"Of course, all of these programs were conducted for me, as some of whom probably thought.
"
15156,"Shortly afterwards, my hand came to another letter that was threatened with the council's proposal to convey the goods.
"
15157,"Reply to this letter on September 14 , 2047.
"
15158,"It's not my position to keep those things.
"
15159,"But in your determination, do I have to think seriously ?
"
15160,"After extending these items, how much time should I pay for the salary ?
"
15161,"Should I have confusion on your determination if I did not pay for a penny even after seventeen days ?
"
15162,"Still, do you believe that by trying to plot a conspiracy or blocking the sword or delaying another reason ?
"
15163,"Therefore, if you pay for Jeth and Asar's salary, I will immediately explain the items with me.
"
15164,"It is also my moral duty.
"
15165,"The letter was given to Prime Minister and Minister for Labor and Social Welfare also.
"
15166,"After that I went to the highest court to seek justice.
"
15167,"Let's go to the court.
"
15168,"Social Services National Coordination Council , Secretary of the Council Diwakar Chand and other four employees made an opposition. I gave the corridor to the Supreme Court.
"
15169,"I made a subject matter that my removal council was against the law.
"
15170,"Supreme Court Judge Prachandra Anil, a member of the Islamic Republic of Israel issued a verdict on why the reasons for "" the reasons why they were fired "" in the name of the opponents .
"
15171,"And on this issue, my advocate was lobbying by senior advocate Mohan Kishna Kharel.
"
15172,"I have to experience a lot of things in life.
"
15173,"Or I am coming to experience many things that happen in my life.
"
15174,"I read the court TT .
"
15175,"But the first time the foot was taken at the court house.
"
15176,"Of course, I have proved to be the first person to get the court in our family.
"
15177,"The news was issued due to the Supreme Court's verdict on August 1 , 2047, printed in the ' Review ' magazine.
"
15178,"This news makes sense for the Council.
"
15179,"Horror and stirred up.
"
15180,"And on that same day evening, the Council's drink came to my house at 7 pm.
"
15181,"On my 2-month salary, the additional one month's salary paid me a check and a letter of three-month salary.
"
15182,"Add a month's extra.
"
15183,"I did not have to pay for three months.
"
15184,"And check the check again at that time.
"
15185,"Also , please send me only my earnings.
"
15186,"Or do I send the solo of my two months ' only to the correspondence council.
"
15187,"I knew the fraud of some of the council members.
"
15188,"Some of the people there made the principle that the people should be taken away from their lives.
"
15189,"They often tried to steal people by stealing them.
"
15190,"So I always tried to be careful with them.
"
15191,"Today, I was forced to tell Niamarambar Acharya's house to bury the drama of them.
"
15192,"Let's go to their house for 6 in the evening.
"
15193,"I had a rope in the chest.
"
15194,"And I had also had a newly created novel.
"
15195,"That is, ' some thinkers of society ' had taken a gift.
"
15196,"I gave this book to Acharya's private secretary, Santat Acharya , saying , ' Brother ! Keep this book in the hands of Minister of State.
"
15197,"If possible, you also want to meet. '
"
15198,"With regard to the minister, he was very busy with a statement of Senate.
"
15199,"And through Sanat Acharya, I left all the incident about police arrival today in my house.
"
15200,"And requesting all of these information to the Minister, I went away from there.
"
15201,"My way was in the imagination of some of the council officials.
"
15202,"That was the only orphans in the palm trees that survived.
"
15203,"Imagine such people, at eight o'clock in the night I will come home.
"
15204,"The face of my council was in my senses like a demon walking in my eyes.
"
15205,"Actually while I was in the council, I often argued with such people.
"
15206,"I did not even imagine the discrimination of such wicked people, one inch from their personal interest.
"
15207,"I had already heard that their main weapon was just a knife , flute and conspiracy.
"
15208,"But their trick was experiencing myself respectively.
"
15209,"However, with caution, sometimes the saints would have to embrace it.
"
15210,"Greetings must have been greeted by the spirit of craven conscience.
"
15211,"Today, I got rid of all these things.
"
15212,"In fact, the interests of others are not the interests of others, such as the shades of Nepal.
"
15213,"Such ineffective people have been walking on the dry streets without limiting the artificial badge of qualification.
"
15214,"That is, we have been moving forward to bury the Sujasjaz Nepali.
"
15215,"Discipline

"
15217,"The discipline which goes on , is called disciplined person.
"
15218,"This definition is equally difficult to follow and accreditation as easy as possible.
"
15219,"This word is not complete in theory only , its perfection is in compliance.
"
15220,"No - a great time - great people have also dhunmunieka anusasanarupi stairs.
"
15221,"When only one person in society dissolves discipline, his bad influence goes to the whole race.
"
15222,"Sage Vishwamitra breaks the discipline of his senses, as Maneka, the heavenly Apostle had to destroy the worldly life.
"
15223,"King of Dushanant forgot wildlife and eventually suffered suffering and depression from Shakuntala.
"
15224,"The heavenly dignified King later turned back to repentance.
"
15225,"Furthermore, there is only one discipline Indra , which could not even hesitate to see Maneka's impression by fierce fear of his power.
"
15226,"But today, it is only the word discipline sandalwood - the unwary God has offered the chapel with more filthy pratimajastai happening - has been.
"
15227,"Student - student independence, artidine teacher - the teacher is always the lack of job chatpatinchan.

"
15232,"Here is our speech is that we - their location , status and positions himself sikaum stay disciplined.

"
15239,"Trust , faith , boldness , support , etc. are synonymous with faith, or in fact a word of faith.
"
15240,"The way to reveal the belief of your honesty is a devotion.
"
15241,"Thus faith is a belief that one person is wearing an ideal feeling personally for someone else's upper level.
"
15242,"Similarly, the situation in which the hope of receiving something from these people is called the faith created from the level of heart.
"
15243,"Faith is a proper definition of faith - belief that hope to get hope .
"
15244,"Thus, all kinds of feelings give birth to faith by mental condition toward their beloved ones , followers , and themselves.
"
15245,"Faith should be raised from both sides.
"
15246,"The one limited to believing another is meaningless.
"
15247,"In that case, your beliefs can become a cause of unbeliever against that.
"
15248,"The belief that this inner heart has a memorable emotional idea.
"
15249,"It can be displayed by the task but can not be shown.
"
15250,"That is why it is the only picture hidden in invisible but emotionally.

15259,"Everyone who believes in his or her needs is to believe and be done, but most of the betrayers are also their own people.
"
15260,"The fact is that the person believes in the fact that his men say.
"
15261,"By exposing that opportunity, selfish people break their own people by lying lies by their own people.
"
15262,"The relatives are persuaded until their destruction is destroyed.

"
15291,"Desire can not be done.
"
15292,"Even if the nature or condition of adversity unfolds, hands may seem void.

15332,"He did not believe in that day.
"
15333,"Even if he did, he would be worried because he did not take it.
"
15334,"He was flinging on his own ground - "" Gyanani is known as Chetananshi Devi Bhagwati hai "" etc.
"
15335,"As a result, everyone kept the fruits , offerings in the southern part of the book.
"
15336,"Finally, after collecting all the money by paying Panditji, he did not take it and brought us all the goods to his house.
"
15337,"He was a strange nature.
"
15338,"He had nothing to do with him.
"
15339,"He completely removed from the lucky lips. He was a fully educated poet.
"
15340,"I also cleansed the ears with the mechanism of Ajpa Gayatri from his main point.
"
15341,"What I have understood is that everyone is the fruit of his blessings.
"
15342,"He was a lord like a King Janak.
"
15343,"Anyone who asked him would give an answer to him.
"
15344,"Even in my life, politics and practice had to be taken place both.
"
15345,"At one point , I was within politics , and at home I had to take care of home behavior.

"
15347,"The hazard threatened mentality.
"
15348,"After all, what is human nature , why did it happen to be worried ?
"
15349,"In the end, the unbelievable mind felt shrinking.
"
15350,"Similarly, Mr. Chirjvi's brother, Mr. Madhav Prasad Dhangelji, made a complaint with Chiranjeevi's brother.
"
15351,"At that time, the four sects of Sierra Leone were the merchants of the cargo station.
"

"
15354,"My eyes also open open eyes.
"
15355,"Even my chichrists had been tired.
"
15356,"Expense sources were many , but the source was the only farming.
"
15357,"That too would be the lowest income after getting married to Chandwind.
"
15358,"One day I went to Kanchanpur.
"
15359,"There was a doctor meeting with Laxmanyar.
"
15360,"I made my own problems with her.
"
15361,"He finds a lot of elite curtains in his honeymoon , I walked and walked .

15367,"At the spring, we ate the rice of a fire filled with offerings of Agnidav.
"
15368,"I was also a doctor of the doctor Yuganarayan.
"
15369,"He did not eat the vessels because he was shocked.
"
15370,"But that time was the same.
"
15371,"I was unable to burn the fire due to the fire.
"
15372,"Peer was also old.
"
15373,"I was fresh enough to have a land of Rs . How to pay.
"
15374,"Gathered for the visit to the holy place and collected a landmark interest bag somewhere and passed the land on October 15.
"
15375,"That time was the time of trial for my life.
"
15376,"I lacked fear.
"
15377,"Sadly, I was tied up with issues of issue.
"
15378,"There was a large settlement of the streets.
"
15379,"We camped up to the beach.
"
15380,"The work was done on the banks side of the Lohrahrah.
"
15381,"We reached the village at 5 o'clock.
"
15382,"The sun had dug out.
"
15383,"We were tired.
"
15384,"In the village there was one of the familiar Nepalese people in their own district.
"
15385,"I "" at night, because the stay here, "" says the activities and asked , "" here is how far bhaundaha ?"" That.
"
15386,"He said ""the closeness is near. ""
"
15387,"We said again - "" How much is it , or not it ?""
"
15388,"But he did not answer.
"
15389,"After all, the way we walk in there dedhakosa far , it dark desert night , Mars will be no exception.
"
15390,"At the dark, we shifted the road for one hour.
"
15391,"Then, after we got to the road 9:00 pm, we got to bed in the tired night.
"
15392,"The shops were all closed.
"
15393,"A shop was found in chaurea and we were on a dry chute with salt nuts.
"
15394,"At the same time, one of his relatives came and tried to introduce us.
"
15395,"After the couple doubled the Kayastha race, he took Douglas to the chapper and took his home.
"
15396,"I said I was alive.
"
15397,"I knew that same day there was a difference between Nepalese and widow's social behavior.
"
15398,"The first I familiarize Nepali did not vow.

15401,"All are awesome.
"
15402,"But the dacoas did not come there.
"
15403,"Similarly, the night passed with horrible situations.
"
15404,"Earlier this morning, the people got up in the market every morning at 8:00 pm.
"
15405,"Even though there is a lot of water in the air, it is also interesting to hear.
"
15406,"It was easy to do everything that I did to make it easier.
"
15407,"Because they landed the entire land with love.
"
15408,"They were happy to get a lot of money from the land that was killed.

"
15839,"We're sorry.
"
15840,"When some members ask when to find the meeting, and some say they do not have the decision of their party.

15846,"After all, the leader of the mass movement also demanded the dissolution of the Commission in the general meeting in Pokhara.
"
15847,"Actually it was possible.
"
15848,"The President told me one evening evening - "" Sunnatha !
"
15849,"In fact, this commission has no right and does not have to enter the commission without believing the public.
"
15850,"I will resign and it is best to do that. ""

15856,"The commission was dissolved, and thus about 3 - 4 days and bustle and mental stress and disturbed parts was capped.
"
15857,"It's cool.
"
15858,"This was a very decisive and big event in the country's political history.

"
15879,"This is my acceptance for me.
"
15880,"Even you have not been under action.
"
15881,"The person makes an impression about someone from the outside and hears one's mind , but the work may be different.
"
15882,"I have not worked with anyone, with whom I am familiar with twenty years.
"
15883,"Changed circumstances and references !

15889,"No matter how unusual I did.
"
15890,"It seems that administration of Sri 5 can also be very useful if appropriate attention and satisfaction towards the goal.

15891,"It seems like a lot of friends are also earning.
"
15892,"Expanding expansion is going on.

15901,"Religion Relativity , Religion Absolutely , Do not Know Religion
"
15902,"From the beginning, the origin of religion started to appear.
"
15903,"The president revealed his reaction to ""the things that were not taken into consideration of these things and the origin of such things. ""
"
15904,"However, religion , language reservation has become increasingly different from human rights , equitable definition of constitutional monarchy , judiciary and balance of balance .
"
15905,"At that time, anyone who had orally originated in his heart could have come to the office of the Commission.

15942,"If my bus was discontinued, they gave me a promise to put the city together.
"
15943,"I slept on the taxi.
"
15944,"Friends were shocked at the Kanai hostel.
"
15945,"I gratefully asked the taxi cadres to leave and came from the taxi.
"
15946,"Just did not come.
"
15947,"If I knew this, then, would I have more time with my son ?
"
15948,"Just did not come

15957,"The sun was not an accident.
"
15958,"In the grass, Tushno Shan was sitting in a shadow , as proud of us proudly said , ' Get a picnic !' '
"
15959,"The friends were flocking out of a thick mouth , while running to the hostel , sometimes running to the camp.

16011,"Do you have a fever ?
"
16012,"My dear and wise son, father ! Father ! ! Did you call me?
"
16013,"It was hard to remember.
"
16014,"And as many children, I used to do many things that would help me to adjust myself.
"
16015,"I remembered the relatives who had left my son in charge.
"
16016,"' If I get a little bit off, I'll run the office of the office. '

"
16053,"Perhaps possible ?
"
16054,"He was asleep and silent like Dulkuta's Sulghari.
"
16055,"The air was going to say no quietly.
"
16056,"Waiter was like a horizon.
"
16057,"Thakurji was like a lucky lord who was greedy to speak.
"
16058,"Students were shaking like a branch and leaf , were flooding as floods.

16060,"Laugh all the way
"
16061,"What kind of sentence does the saying mean to be inconvenient , symbolic or derivative ?
"
16062,"Do not know
"
16063,"If we do not like the plague - a plague began to spread.
"
16064,"' Flame of the fall ? '
"
16065,"A large hull is covered by the bus.
"
16066,"Whispered the trick.
"
16067,"I ran on to catch what I did not fall.
"
16068,"In fact, there is nothing more than five seven grains of potatoes.
"
16069,"Just run back
"
16070,"Limney and gurongsene saw white dogs like smoky lumps showing white teeth.
"
16071,"We arrived in the turbulence of the trunk and the corn.
"
16072,"Our bus is on the couch.
"
16073,"' Come on , go on the Koko bus.' '
"
16074,"I propose.
"
16075,"Others supported.
"
16076,"' Where and many, to reach the mountain. '
"
16077,"The recipient gathered the matter against opposing our proposal.
"
16078,"We do not know those who are unaware.
"
16079,"In fact, we have never been short of thought.
"
16080,""" Headache. '
"
16081,"Uma Bani said.
"
16082,"Paras also talked badly and hurt the head.
"
16083,"Both of them had slept with a cold salty and bowed down with the head of the cottage head.
"
16084,"Sinners !
"
16085,"It was like to screw the wicked on the other side and walk.
"
16086,"I looked far away from Kathmandu.
"
16087,"Dum Patt was looking for.
"
16088,"I thought, ' papistha ! It is because of me, I have not been able to bring my son-in-law. '
"
16089,"It was like that, that sinner, who used to smell the fire with a whirlpool fire.
"
16090,"We reached the mountain of Canyon.
"
16091,"Oh !
"
16092,"How good is my childhood.
"
16093,"I had spotlight , a little forest of , Fog come , thin settlements was like a highland village.
"
16094,"I am pleased with the sun's sunlight.
"
16095,"The cold air crew my hand.
"
16096,"Tamang C - Small jhupraharule asked why had not already ?
"
16097,"I'm just lucky to smile.
"
16098,"' Uh , that's the Trivuli river , the tindi from the same place.
"
16099,"My house should be there. '
"
16100,"The pole was used as a bargain, and it would have been like a stroke.
"
16101,"Vishnu showed me the walls , turtles and markets of Nuwakot .
"
16102,"I got to know some of the fun moments I had someday.
"
16103,"Deepak
"
16104,"Keshu saw the son of Kishore and again went to my heart towards Kirtipur.
"
16105,"My son used to find Deepak , Deepak told Siran.
"
16106,"They too would be pleased with us as friends, as young ones.
"
16107,"I looked at Deepak.
"
16108,"He was wise and gentle like Vakil Shrines.
"
16109,"I loved her affectionately, and I'd like to find out that Siren is also standing.
"
16110,"' Lamp ! You love your father very much.
"
16111,"You are also the mother of affection.
"
16112,"But father !
"
16113,"In the world there are such children of your age who are neither mother nor a father. '
"
16114,"But I personally said , 'The flowers are both good, even if there are gray-grounded ponds, even if the flowers rose in the car.
"
16115,"Because there are two flowers.
"
16116,"They have the same kind of atmosphere as they get.
"
16117,"What's wrong with them ? '
"
16118,"' Where are you? '
"
16119,"Where ? '
"
16120,"It's a little overnight.
"
16121,"Friends dug to search for a place.
"
16122,"I do not do this.
"
16123,"I did not know anything.
"
16124,"Where is the water ?
"
16125,"Where is a convenient place to live ?
"
16126,"I did not know anything.
"
16127,"I was new to this place.
"
16128,"All the friends chose a place on the west.
"
16129,"We started to grow water by carrying the buckets.
"
16130,"After the water was diminished, Pashupati's brother and Vishnu Brother Tamang went to the lamps.
"
16131,"I also followed.
"
16132,"I like this , in the winter , it was like eating cream cream cream maize in the winter.
"
16133,"I was in the search of Maca Bhatmas.
"
16134,"Tamang shops were wandering on auctioned slide.
"
16135,"Oh !
"
16136,"How sweet it is !
"
16137,"Breakfast is eaten.
"
16138,"A tomatoes sister also spoiled maize buttermass.
"
16139,"I felt so late.
"
16140,"We stirred up and stirred corn corners, and ran to Hul to spread corn fisheries to others.
"
16141,"The bus carrying us was stopped at a large level.
"
16142,"The stop bus was trying to knock down my classmate with love stirring.
"
16143,"What did he do ?
"
16144,"I walk
"
16145,"' Hey love ! '
"
16146,"I scream
"
16147,"The flame has already begun to fly - the water stirred down to the Fairyland.
"
16148,"To come to Anabhattan Khan, Rummati and dancing by drowning , Perhaps he might think so.
"
16149,"I'm lucky.
"
16150,"It's also a fun for the killers.
"
16151,"But at Hulma, the friends were busy working.
"
16152,"The image , the room , the driver, were preparing to shake.
"
16153,"Ram Prasad Dotri , Paras Hari, was patrolling at work.
"
16154,"Dumu , Sudha , Nirmala were flinging to Angna.
"
16155,"Ambika , Uma , Shanta and Prabha Sabha were busy working with the cutting edge.
"
16156,"A river of the sea was flowing.
"
16157,"The nearby gown was leaving the cashew cats.
"
16158,"Narendra was cutting onions.
"
16159,"Indira and Lakshmi were using rice.
"
16160,"The cats played in the trenches of the cats.
"
16161,"The two two dear spirits did not feel like Goddess and Awasthi.
"
16162,"Do not buy a horse
"
16163,"Wakil came just ahead of the family , but the irony of the said , his though , there was found to live.
"
16164,"It was like a displaced to live with a camp.
"
16165,"That was the reason , Captain Rapmunden.
"
16166,"He was then a prisoner of Birgunj jail.
"
16167,"The reporter was nominated in that house on the family.
"
16168,"The time of the Rana regime , the position of Jailar and the feudal rivals of Rampurman Thapa.
"
16169,"The Strength of Speaking ?
"
16170,"That was why it was also a difficult task to tell him to leave the house.
"
16171,"There was no remedy.
"
16172,"One day Govindrachandra went and said - ""It was to leave the house that we would have to pay the rest. ""
"
16173,"Go , I'll clear the house. ""
"
16174,"Then Narayan Chandra was also with him.
"
16175,"Sometime he also argued with Reporter.
"
16176,"The peripheral of that incident was destroyed.
"
16177,"Even an old house was very enthusiastic.
"
16178,"Felt alienated , now made some arrangement , some stability comes.
"
16179,"Really come.
"
16180,"But some other people also did not come together.
"
16181,"A long family had to become present in the house of three small rooms in the small room.
"
16182,"My novels "" One room in a city "" may have been mixed with that psychosocial psychology.
"
16183,"That's the reason too.
"
16184,"How long did the children say that no room for some children of that family?
"
16185,"They were really displaced and they did not sleep in the bedroom.
"
16186,"Tin trunk
"
16187,"It was the same experience , which was due to ease , but the inevitable was surprising.
"
16188,"While looking at that house, it was fierce , but it was small , insufficient , that means.
"
16189,"Although there was a large family coming from Birgunj to Raxul , there was no one in the entire family.
"
16190,"But another member was added.
"
16191,"Meet the bed
"
16192,"After staying in Raxau, Deepthioth quarter was pregnant.
"
16193,"Three sons were born , so this time they were looking for a daughter.
"
16194,"A Tamang named Meeta came to their house - knew that he used to do something , it does not know.
"
16195,"But that was ' knowing ' .
"
16196,"After pregnancy, Deepthali was shown one day after pregnancy.
"
16197,"He sprouted a mantle while stirring in a mantle.
"
16198,"Dipavatiko wanted , daughter or not.
"
16199,"So, when they showed the dog, their curiosity grew up.
"
16200,"Setele continued for by chanting , meditation after its ruling , this time chorai born.
"
16201,"It may be very fortunate to not see it in the ground , born on the bed.
"
16202,"It will be good
"
16203,"They may be , it has to be listening to some disappointment , the daughter's lack of desire to complete.
"
16204,"Or have they thought that the bridegroom is simple , seeing them without logic?
"
16205,"But how was coincidence , their immediate descendants were born as a son.
"
16206,"However, due to the fact that the matter of the ancestor was a little shaken or considered by an academic or a lack of illness , it could not be born in the bed.
"
16207,"He was born on the ground.
"
16208,"After the son, they have come to them , and they should have given birth to the cot.
"
16209,"Named Cheetchand.
"
16210,"Therefore, if Cheetchandra is born in Raksulha, all the memory , nature and introduction are started in Birgunj.
"
16211,"The name of the child was named Cheetchand Nevarnan and was in Ashwini constellation and Aries.
"
16212,"Later, the name of his name was Polar Chandra.
"
16213,"I was the same child.
"
16214,"Friends of the same name
"
16215,"I remember as their childhood , viraganjakai is.
"
16216,"Another one is remembering Nepalgunj.
"
16217,"If you could stay in Birgunj , once again , Govindrachra , my father , started working in Nepalgunj Bansar.
"
16218,"The airport has been there with his , den sahumahajanale remember loved blur.
"
16219,"It seems that our whole family in Nepalgunj was.
"
16220,"Once I scattered a scorpion.
"
16221,"Nepalganj was a place to scatter.
"
16222,"Scorpion bites I was unconscious that joined in , but his arms and I remember my mother wearing medicine.
"
16223,"The broken letter still appears in my right leg.
"
16224,"Another reminder is the temple of Baigeshwari and that side of the lake.
"
16225,"Nepalgunj is also nominated for Rabbed.
"
16226,"I still remember Rabbie's taste.
"
16227,"Many years after I went to Nepalgunj, I did not find anything else, according to memory, some changes were found in front of Bageshwari Temple.
"
16228,"There is another memory , lost the brother. Two years after I was born, the younger brother was Excellent Chandra.
"
16229,"He beaten one day.
"
16230,"Mama , Ishwesh Chandra , and I remembered walking in search of the best.
"
16231,"Later, in any house in Gaganganj, he was kept singing with a vaccine , a vaccine and a goat .
"
16232,"She found happiness after her mother's face was lightly light.
"
16233,"Later, on the Nepalgunj journey, I tried to know those places of Gaganganj.
"
16234,"Could not figure out
"
16235,"There was a family in Nepalgunj , which had a strong relationship with our family.
"
16236,"There is no memory of any other member of that family , except two sons, Tuturam and Maniram.
"
16237,"Tuturam was bigger than me , Dubai and high.
"
16238,"She ran away from a home alone.
"
16239,"Do not know what happened then.
"
16240,"Maniram was mine.
"
16241,"I was a friend and I used to play with him.
"
16242,"Later, our family from Nepalgunj returned to Birgunj.
"
16243,"Maniram left there.
"
16244,"He never again met in life with him.
"
16245,"After Birgunj, our interest increased with another family.
"
16246,"The door was also stressed.
"
16247,"It helped me to increase my intensity.
"
16248,"There was also a child named Maniram in that family.
"
16249,"Earlier, seeing this Manamaram, I remembered the memories of Nepalgunj's Maniram.
"
16250,"Later, the Maniram became close and intimate.
"
16251,"This memoramum is not clear , I've never met .
"
16252,"Anyway , I thought , gem is my congenital partner.
"
16253,"The school started to go 5 - 6 other guy by the name of the gem ( a girl of ) my friends.
"
16254,"But if the manisita was more closely , with whom house, and the family was juxtaposed with.
"
16255,"Manikhi was the father's name Balram Prasad Upadhyay , who was called all the head.
"
16256,"We also left the head.
"
16257,"His Rishiram , Sriram and Maniram were three sons. The daughter was one , Kameshwari.
"
16258,"After that, she became friends of our sisters.
"
16259,"Mukni Bajayya is known as a very known name that I do not even know what the person named Maniram's real name is.
"
16260,"Never forget even if you know it.
"
16261,"For us he was just ' Mukti Raiya ' .
"
16262,"If meanness , self dipavati mother's name also aparicitajasto me to grow ; Because of all he also addressed ' Mukti Raiya '
"
16263,"Mukini Riyya , mother of Manamam , had fought a lot in life.
"
16264,"He would have been listening to us once again and again by taking the wreck, not to handle him.
"
16265,"First memory
"
16266,"If someone asked you what is the memory of his amakopahilo , this is not easy for me to say that.
"
16267,"But there is an image like this.
"
16268,"Mother is opening a small wooden bowl and is pushing money, and I am standing with his chest.
"
16269,"He goes away , I am going somewhere.
"
16270,"No - no, when he is bored to deliver jhadkarnu lap.
"
16271,"I'll take it again
"
16272,"I am asking for food due to hunger.
"
16273,"This is the mother's first memory memory.
"
16274,"This is not the next
"
16275,"When it is , do not know.
"
16276,"But Birgunj is , know about.
"
16277,"May I have already mentioned , Mother was a tantle , a little bronze.
"
16278,"I remember her voice too.
"
16279,"But his memory as a woman of generous heart.
"
16280,"He had helped some people.
"
16281,"There was a clear habit of habit , and religious sentiments were strong.
"
16282,"Hannah's daughter of Leader's leader , grew up in Annapatha , so giving it to someone, giving her hands , and hands.
"
16283,"Donation was his nature.
"
16284,"His voice was abusing at home.
"
16285,"After eating a vessel, the mouth had to put a bowl of good dishes and kept on growing for a long time.
"
16286,"There was also a choice of eating habits.
"
16287,"I still like the same.
"
16288,"Occasionally thought , amnesty is also hereditary ?
"
16289,"This is seen in our family accidentally.
"
16290,"Others also enjoy delightful pleasures.
"
16291,"At the moment , while I was talking , maybe our family was walking towards prosperity.
"
16292,"In Nepalgunj , a person had bought a cry of crying while saying , a beauty.
"
16293,"The other was purchased but sold after that.
"
16294,"I never went there , so there is no experience.
"
16295,"Buying a funeral is to really take care of the scene.
"
16296,"The villages were more than one in a sense.
"
16297,"Our name was the exhibition.
"
16298,"There was also a separate village called Euphrates.
"
16299,"But besides that ; Bahrampuri , Betuna etc. Village was also under the Jinnahnagar.
"
16300,"Prachanda was called Bariyarpur.
"
16301,"But I only understood the solid meaning that a large village called Bariyarpur is divided into two parts , where the Gadhhi Mausoleum is.
"
16302,"The 5-year-old fair is famous.
"
16303,"When we went to the village, Variparpur came to Watto.
"
16304,"After the arrival of Bariyarpur, the feeling of anxiety was coming to the village.
"
16305,"At some time in Veriyarpur, some were found familiar and able to find out.
"
16306,"We stayed in bed.
"
16307,"The village was known to be known as Bethany , but it was far away from the Bethany Bastavik Shivikhar village.
"
16308,"How many times did I go when I grew up from the carpet crop?
"
16309,"Bethany was considered to be an ancient village.
"
16310,"How old is that the residents of the village could not say.
"
16311,"I often tried to know its ancient times.
"
16312,"But most of the villages were unread.
"
16313,"They did not have that idea of ​​time and history.
"
16314,"How many people would even tell their age as Khathabhavi?
"
16315,"Once one - two children borne aimaisamga asked his age.
"
16316,"She told her age 12 years.
"
16317,"If so many told that , there was a huge forest in Bethlehem.
"
16318,"As Beth - forest settlement , the name of the village is Bethany.
"
16319,"But when we went there , there were some remains of the alleged Vatican - forest.
"
16320,"Instead, a large circle of bars appeared.
"
16321,"The village was standing on the south side of the living village.
"
16322,"On the other hand , I did not see the village , it was only the same branch .
"
16323,"Every time the village has been seen from the far away , the support of the person would have to reassure his tiredness again and again.
"
16324,"The gangriers were seen that it seemed like an illusion.
"
16325,"Most of the big man was Birta our maujajasto sock , which they have received Rana rulers were pleasing or other means.
"
16326,"Just like our masculine shimser was a disciple.
"
16327,"Even though I never saw Neer Samsmers , that was the name in the receipt , as a invisible lover , but we have a name called bump .
"
16328,"Every year, the lender who used to make a funeral had to explain the vendor by defying the freight with each year.
"
16329,"The freight vendor used to eat that there was no other system , I did not know.
"
16330,"In the part of the lord, Malopot came to be an extraordinary addition to Tara.
"
16331,"Although it was not mentioned anywhere receipt of practice, but it malapotajattikai "" mandatory "" was considered.
"
16332,"The Raiti was very poor or if he could not give a one-day day, he would have left the knife.
"
16333,"But sometimes it would show even more rigidity.
"
16334,"Moreover , what would happen to the lord , the greatest benefit was to be subject to death , whose responsibility was to be a liar.
"
16335,"Apart from that, other Alanias were also likely to have the opportunity to take place in the name of Bayarasi village , which was a liquid and could not be repayed.
"
16336,"In reality, such a wish was made when there was no fun.
"
16337,"If a person was a liar, his loyalty to his loyalty had also touched the number of cases of similar land.
"
16338,"In that way, we were now a lender. Maybe Rs . 1600 - Bhai . Rs . I had bought the story.
"
16339,"Our settlement was in place.
"
16340,"Our house in the village people ' court ' Ah, and we are the owners.
"
16341,"The word ' boss ' was emphasized on the back of our name .
"
16342,"Like , Dhan Boss , Gopal Boss , God Boss.
"
16343,"It was fine here. My name was a terrible mixture.
"
16344,"People outside of the pole and taking my name ' bitter ' were saying , the household Everyone Me ' linchpin ' writing.
"
16345,"The villagers did not know that it was the bad name , so they used to call me , the ax.
"
16346,"I had the habit of addressing that same.
"
16347,"However , we were the owner of the village due to the village , getting a long feudal antiquity.
"
16348,"My overall childhood is divided into two parts.
"
16349,"Virganj and Vituna.
"
16350,"City and village
"
16351,"That is why I have the influence of both places , consciousness and in subconscious levels.
"
16352,"This effect still persists, and this can also be seen in my writing as well.
"
16353,"Fight and match
"
16354,"Bai and mother's relationship was of traditional nature.
"
16355,"Mother did not have to bear injustice, but she had to endure from the beginning.
"
16356,"Now he was the head of the housewife , so it was good .
"
16357,"But if I remember that , sometimes sometimes I had to drop my hand on my mother.
"
16358,"Let us stir up and uphold the autonomy and anarchist nature and activity.
"
16359,"Bihar dependent
"
16360,"Nepali Communist Movement had to go through the sad situation of differences , division and division in the 20s.
"
16361,"When the 30s arrived in the decade, unity efforts started with foot.
"
16362,"In the 40s, the integrity or integrity is increasingly moving forward as the main principle.
"
16363,"In the late 30s, Communist organizations, known as a different name, more than 1 dozen different names, have remained united to the tune of half a dozen.
"
16364,"The fact that building a single integrated communist party is still a far-reaching goal.
"
16365,"At the same time, it is definitely to reach that goal.
"
16366,"The change in the situation of the situation is very different from the person's imagination and desire.
"
16367,"So the situation is in a disadvantaged state.
"
16368,"In other words , now it has no future and can not be a subject of attraction.
"
16369,"Although the attack on communal forces of communist anti-communal forces globally is not new , it is still going on in a single voice.
"
16370,"Communist parties and socialist system are temporarily going through a kind of crisis or a difficult situation.
"
16371,"In our country, the minority of reactionary forces of the Communist principles , ideas and desire to defeat not only the law , tyasakaviruddhama are actively lagirahekai.
"
16372,"The majority of the people are exploited - the working people want to see its pioneer and are also actively supporting them.
"
16373,"That integration was also warm and welcome from the public level.
"
16374,"Recently, the CPI ( United Nations ) separatist policy of the group and the people who differed with views differ greatly.
"
16375,"Magazines have mentioned that they also want to work with our party and want to work together.
"
16376,"Thus , especially after the integration between the two parties , our party has been established as the basis of the Nepali Communist movement.
"

"
16806,"Even though my father was alive I was not so upset to read the school.
"
16807,"But since 1993, I began to study in difficult circumstances.
"
16808,"That is, when my father died, my life became like a dark night.
"
16809,"My father was unexpectedly shattered after the father's protection was separated.
"
16810,"Say, after the death of my father, the dangers of distress were crucified in the heart of every member of our house.
"
16811,"Due to the desperate financial situation of the house, I began to become a bad situation respectively.
"
16812,"And then I started swinging with my toll's respectively.
"
16813,"Then I started working hard to work hard in my guilds.
"
16814,"In their instructions, I had to carry large loads.
"
16815,"The gangs were robbing my hair , hair and hair.
"
16816,"I was also doing all the tasks of the gang until I reached.
"
16817,"At that time my name was called "" Brother . ""
"
16818,"I went to their trap and went to the furnaces respectively.
"
16819,"Laughter of the flavors of the furnace was losing my friends.
"
16820,"And while sitting in the rug of the young lady's nurse, my cowboys lived in the area until my herds were not found.
"
16821,"Also, in my glass they also added alcohol to the liquor.
"
16822,"But even though I was in a bowl of inspiration, I never consumed more alcohol.
"
16823,"Instead, as much as alcohol was added to my cups, I always poured alcohol to the ground.
"
16824,"I was getting rid of this kind of doll friends.
"
16825,"From those behaviors, earthquakes continued to continue in my chest.
"
16826,"So I was wondering to be free from that unfair situation.
"
16827,"And after some time, it was also successful to break away from such incidents.
"
16828,"I wish my heart was not found again in life.
"
16829,"But again, by force, I reached the trap of the neck.
"
16830,"The gun also gave me a lot of money.
"
16831,"The necklace of that time was also foolish , obscene, and immoral.
"
16832,"Even if I did not want, I got to be caring for such a kid.
"
16833,"In addition, I had become the crew of that calf.
"
16834,"But a few years later I was very successful to get rid of that trauma.
"
16835,"I was a boyfriend my boyfriend.
"
16836,"My friends expected one thing after meeting me.
"
16837,"Because of my father's death, I was in white clothes.
"
16838,"By applying a little bit of white clothes, I met my friends to reach Yatkatol.
"
16839,"In the previous fall of white coat, which was recently added to the short cut, I got to the place to share my friends with the food.
"
16840,"And to buy foods, I could sometimes get money from my uncle.
"
16841,"My mama sometimes visited my bedroom to see my mother.
"
16842,"After the mama got found in my house, I kept muming at my head's head.
"
16843,"After meeting with mother and mama came out of my house, I used to ask two rupees for mama.
"
16844,"At that time, a lot of money got plenty of coffee and juice.
"
16845,"And by buying them, I would bring to my friends where I was.
"
16846,"Actually at that time, my friends were stuck at me.
"
16847,"They would have my natives in relation to my friends' relationship.
"
16848,"At that time, my nephews used to call me "" uncle "" .
"
16849,"Sharadman Singh , Bhuvwanman Singh , Shankarman Singh and Girija Lal Shrestha of my nephew were attached to me .
"
16850,"And that week I was always eating such foods.
"
16851,"The yatkhatolama my bhanjaharumarphata other - other friends were going to increase the number of.
"
16852,"And all Yatkha's friends used to call me "" uncle "" .
"
16853,"Actually my time had gone to a very dark spot.
"
16854,"At that time, I did not want to call the meaning of my life.
"
16855,"After that, my condition was being proven that the person was deprived of the same attitude.
"
16856,"Although my heart was disappointed, my mother was really optimistic from me.
"
16857,"My mother was deceived as if my son was big.
"
16858,"Most parts of my life remain in compliance with my nephew.
"
16859,"At that time , Shardaman Singh , Bhuvwanman Singh and Hasamaina Singh were the queenjansaji who came to get close to me in the house .
"
16860,"These often used to eat , stay and sleep in my home .
"
16861,"And my father also loved my grandfather.
"
16862,"What is more fun in the childhood , than eating and eating ?
"
16863,"So , when I was not too late playing, I was never overwhelming , and I was never overwhelming.
"
16864,"Of course, I had to keep doing this job.
"
16865,"Similarly, when we arrived in Yatak, the luminous lions were coming.
"
16866,"The monster was called Moti Kaji.
"
16867,"Sharaddam Singh never used to leave our party.
"
16868,"The family's house was Pananakzai.
"
16869,"And Ganeshman Singh also used to come back in our playground.
"
16870,"To Ganeshman, we had to address the heroic brother.
"
16871,"The best person in our days was Diamondakaji.
"
16872,"The diamonds were also bigger than we were, and the age was twice as high as ours.
"
16873,"In fact, after he had gone to Hulkaji in our Holi, we were worried about him.
"
16874,"So only until we reached the door of Hirakaji, we could have justified our group.
"
16875,"But after the arrival of Heera Kaji, we soon became lazy.
"
16876,"Although we were scattered by his appearance, he lived there.
"
16877,"There was a separate room in our place to play in Yatkha.
"
16878,"In fact, a room on the floor of a house was divided into the name of the school room.
"
16879,"In that same room our balcony would be morning and evening.
"
16880,"There was a bed in the same room room.
"
16881,"And that bedding was lovely.
"
16882,"So she often was slipping in the same room.
"
16883,"Yachtokal was not the place of my home.
"
16884,"But the harmony of Banjwaniji gave me the feeling of my toll by Yatkotto.
"
16885,"And I was also familiar with the entire house of that toll.
"
16886,"Because every child of that toll was counting on my nephew.
"
16887,"Or say I was lucky for their dear ones.
"
16888,"So at the time of eating daily meals, I would also be invited to the house of Yatkha.
"
16889,"At that time I was a student of the High School.
"
16890,"But at that time some of my friends had gone to India for studying.
"
16891,"Actually I was very sad when I was separated with them.
"
16892,"After leaving our group , Motikaji , Pannakaji , Bhuvanaji , and Girivalal went to Benaras, and he went to Calcutta.
"
16893,"But even though they went to such a developed place, they would have been in trial.
"
16894,"And I would have passed in the High School High School.
"
16895,"After knowing the details of our exam, Gujmanman Singh encouraged me.
"
16896,"In fact, I often encouraged to nurture , inspiration and affection diirahanthe.
"
16897,"At that time , Gumanjuman Singh was the one who planted a brave plant in my distress , fatherless , and anxious heart.
"
16898,"Guanjuman Signo was also my son-in-law.
"
16899,"That is , the sister who raised me up with milk , Gengman Singh was Maheshwar of the same Parvati.
"
16900,"Actually, my second sister Ganga Devi who loved me a little.
"
16901,"In my childhood life, his help was helpful , goodwill and motivation , fed up, and were awakened.
"
16902,"I loved to read.
"
16903,"I would always go to Koching Class in the morning except school.
"
16904,"My master, who taught in that coaching class was Khadgaman Mall.
"
16905,"And along with me, Gauri Prasad also used to go to study at times.
"
16906,"Gauriprasad was the grandfather of Kaka Vishnu Prasad.
"
16907,"But Gauripasad was older than five years old.
"
16908,"I rose up early in the morning and prepared my lesson.
"
16909,"But Gauri Prasad used to honor the morning sleep very much.
"
16910,"So she used to go to the throat , full , saturday and coaching classes on Tuesday.
"
16911,"Or else, when he was inclined, I walked with me only.
"
16912,"Gauri Prasad did not get English education while doing so.
"
16913,"And after studying four, he was admitted to his work.
"

16953,"How to be engaged in and that we destroy . P . My question was centered with.
"
16954,"So it is better to move Gandhi from the ideology before the movement.
"
16955,"If Gandhi made an emblemless movement by destroying the British empire from India, we could eliminate Rana by adopting the same path . ""

"
16962,"And from there he was brought to prison in Sundarij.
"
16963,"V . P . In a few days after the arrival of the jail, the market was shattered , and they arrived at India at the same time.

"
16966,"Organizational work was conducted rapidly with the anti-Rana deviation.
"
16967,"At that time Ganeshman Singh had also traveled from India to participate in the movement.
"
16968,"So, she was also looking for a secret by Rana's spouse.
"
16969,"And with this reason, his brother Moti Kaji got rid of his brothers and sisters and came to the place where I was.
"
16970,"If she enters my house and is worried , "" Mama ! Mama ! To help keep the underground underground. ""

"
16976,"Regardless of whether it was underground or openly openly, I had fully followed my duty.
"
16977,"In short, all of these things, I went through my chest to succeed the revolution.
"
16978,"After the arrangement of the Nepalese People's Congress, the convenience of the instrument began to feel as if the two factions of the National Congress were after them.
"
16979,"On the other hand, Koirala was a faulty office and some worker, but was negligible.
"
16980,"Only V. in the Indian socialist party's ball . P . The anti-Koirala campaign was on.
"
16981,"Even if the Indian people had been able to run, Koirala, who was not a member of the Indian Congress, had become a member of the Congress Congress, but did not fill the party's activities.

"
16990,"Former Sri 3, Bhim Shamsher's son, was a son, and other rare rites also took place here.
"
16991,"The attempts of the Indian socialist parties and the Indian Congress departments, according to the advice of the Indian Congress, began to be very tremendous.
"
16992,"The National Congress Koirala team also indicated that it should be the one who could overcome the leadership of the leadership.
"
16993,"There was a great fear that leadership was trying to protect them.
"
16994,"Regmi Goot was also invited to match.
"
16995,"But his allegations, even if he was a member, did not get the opinion of looking for leadership.

"
17013,"I will also see that.
"
17014,"The train was racing with the speed of its speed.
"

"
17033,"This new vision is set up in front of the most important objective of Nepalese National Congress, this new political institution. ""
"
17034,"Reading the above phrase shows that the main purpose of the National Congress was not to maintain the sovereignty of the country by bringing the democratic system in Nepal.
"
17035,"Instead, it had put Nepal's ultimate access to India in the end.
"
17036,"Addressing Patna, the Congress was working to open the Central Office in Lajaj.
"
17037,"After meeting with the Chief Minister of the party, he also met with the chairman of the organization at his own camp, Mahendra Vikram.
"
17038,"Both the people urged to join the Democratic Congress in collaboration with the Congress.
"
17039,"But what did the listeners listen to, did not inspire to move ahead.

17055,"Fortunately, the investigation was sponsored.
"
17056,"In Patna, there was good news about the Chhattisgarh Congress.
"
17057,"Comparative view of the organization's activities, more than democracy was negligible.
"
17058,"After leaving the house, after walking to protest against Rana Shahi, it was reasonable to do even more work by using the opportunity to get opportunity.
"
17059,"In Patna, the Indian Samajwadi Dal convention received an opportunity to see Patna Lavan.
"
17060,"After hearing this, Koirala Gut was sure to know that the Indian socialist party was a fonts of Nepal.
"
17061,"At this time Sri Shank Prasad Nepal came out from the Nepalese People's Party (Maoist).
"
17062,"Nepalji Rana ruled out foreigners as foreigners, but Rainshahi feared the fear of taking charge of the government not working.
"
17063,"That time the government was considered political offense even then.
"
17064,"He had all his own Rana government in the absence of reading allowance but did not work after foreign exchange.

17075,"Even in his statement, I also set my right.
"
17076,"The first duty was to destroy Ranaashahi.
"
17077,"The responsibility of duty is to be self-sufficient.
"
17078,"But what is the virtue of others?
"
17079,"So doubtful doubts seemed to have been put in concrete work rather than lightweight in Kakra.
"
17080,"As a result, I also entered democracy in the Congress.
"
17081,"Ranaashahi's opposition was made to prepare polls.
"
17082,"Accordingly, "" Nepal Call "" was given to Shankar Prasad and the writer of this line.

"
17184,"He brought the upper layer , but I did not work.
"
17185,"Even though my strangers did not come to favor me , I realized that friend's trick is running.
"
17186,"One morning the starring me called out and asked - "" Have you gone to Ganeshmanji ?""
"
17187,""" No , I have not been , go no reason.
"
17188,"I said
"
17189,""" That's okay !""
"
17190,"The stars returned to the room.

17195,"When Mike was touched by a talk of poor talk from the government, Shukantala Devi of the announcement gave Mike his face.
"
17196,"Do not talk here , how to request the government to do nothing ?
"
17197,"Another morning, with my family I went to the radio station - to show father reading the news.
"
17198,"Dinesh was my sixth year old son.
"
17199,"When he tried to send out, he cried out loudly.
"
17200,"The voice of the cry Michael tiped.
"
17201,"The star listened to a lot of fun in this incident.
"
17202,"But what ?
"
17203,"There should be any means to solve.
"
17204,"There was nothing like that.
"
17205,"The room was small , and the same place was mounted on the same table.
"
17206,"Around the same table, Rashim Rajya Laxmi , Alice Rana , Murari Krishna Sharma , Prakashman Singh , Rajendra Kumar Gupta and I ( Harri Shrestha ) .
"
17207,"There was a conversation between the same table and writing in a small chit.
"
17208,"One day after work of Nepali news, Prakashman was living in the light of his stay.
"
17209,"I was reading the news.
"
17210,"The lightweight mashed with the back of the table.
"
17211,"The place was narrow , they could not get up.
"
17212,"Everyone forgot that he sat behind Mike.
"
17213,"All the lazy laughs.
"
17214,"I am laughing reading the news.
"
17215,"Hatharahar Tarini came to my face , but I could not stop laughing , Mike touched.
"
17216,"Later someone raised the light.
"
17217,"At that time the radio station did not go through , only an enthusiasm was only running .
"
17218,"To show this, I have raised the subject here.
"
17219,"There was not a Harbin and Tablasawaw in that room.
"
17220,"Although other means, which is , after work; he went.
"
17221,"The newsletter was written sometime by pressing the newspaper.
"
17222,"This radio is a story of Nepal.
"
17223,"Murari Krishna Sharma worked as a radio reporter.
"
17224,"Despite the lack of qualifications, he was able to write the national and international news in the same table as he did not listen to the radio.
"
17225,"But his work is just about to write news.
"
17226,"He could not read.
"
17227,"Once they reached the news.
"
17228,"There was a rage.
"
17229,"There was a small cantine on one corner of the radio building.
"
17230,"There was nothing , tea , bread , vitamin and cigarette.
"
17231,"We ate there.
"
17232,"Basudev Luitel also used to go to the same canteen tea.
"
17233,"Eating a morning tea hariprasadale BASUDEB said - "" A ... It is damaim , kliyoriyoneta play. ""
"
17234,""" Why not already say ?
"
17235,"What is the tea after eating ?
"
17236,"Wonderful ! ""
"
17237,"It's hard to break the old ritual once.
"
17238,"Basudev was the Uttar Pradesh-based pure Brahmin.
"
17239,"At that time, he could not return to the old ritual , nor come to the new ritual.
"
17240,"Vasudevji was the correspondent of Gorkhapatra at that time.
"
17241,"So he used to come to radio broadcasting from Nepal.
"
17242,"One morning after the news broadcast, Tareen Prasad, while keeping the Mike Agad and addressing someone, was abusing her freak.
"
17243,"I came to know later.
"
17244,"In response to the letter sent by someone, he abused him.
"
17245,"It was asked in the paper - Did women break even menstrual like breakdown of democracy ?
"
17246,"Or did a woman stop living in a monthly period of time ?
"
17247,"If not, why do women always stay living with men ?
"
17248,"The letter apratyaksata : rasmirajyalaksmi and Alice Rana should have been targeted.
"
17249,"I wrote a rupee to play my husband in the year 2013.
"
17250,"It was Rupp - ' Struggle ' .
"
17251,"Rupas included in the program to broadcast from the radio.
"
17252,"Broadcasting Broadcast - It's time to come, but the characters who played as a wife did not come to know , it was a big deal .
"
17253,"Knowing when he was invited to call home - the locker was killed in a locked door in the room that the girl would take part in Rupak.
"
17254,"I got hurt
"
17255,"In the same way the Kamalavati came.
"
17256,"I told him the truth.
"
17257,"He never participated in the same parallel with Vinar Harsel Rupak.
"
17258,"The name of Lakshman Dhanwanshi, playing as a male character in this form, is not inappropriate.
"
17259,"Just thinking of the women's social environment for more than seven years ago, I raised up the rupee.
"
17260,"That was not the drama to play on the platform.
"
17261,"What hesitation on such a thing ?
"
17262,"So, how can I forget those women in Nepal early early in Nepal by breaking such complex bonds and bringing new modes to society ?
"
17263,"Here, the radio has taken Nepal for the early 2013 year.
"
17264,"On the singing, Koilidevi , Kishori , Geetevi , Tardevi, etc. came out, so many women participated in the news branch.
"
17265,"Among them, I remember Trilokak Karki , Siddhi Shah , Shyama , Sukunya Viva and Lakhi Devevi.
"
17266,"Many women came to serve outside the same radio as Nepal.
"
17267,"Therefore, the contribution of women to the rise of radio in Nepal will continue to be unforgettable forever - to remember the honesty.
"
17268,"Tareen Prasad, who took an interest in radio quiz program, was of a frustrating nature.
"
17269,"' What is the difference between the telephone lines and the lanes of Nepal ? He asked the radio in the quiz of the question - Nepal's telephone line is reduced soon.
"
17270,"It is the winters of wild living, even more. '
"
17271,"His quiz was similar , the answer to anyone who would like to be entertained.
"
17272,"One morning , I was resorting to Rasmiya Rajya Laxmi , Kishore Devi , and I was sitting in the radio of Nepal .
"
17273,"Teenager laughs
"
17274,"She was very smart and delicate , but her voice was sweet.
"
17275,"Support of the situation generates demolition
"
17276,"[ 6 ] Writer's discussion on the long comment that the advocate Ganesh Raj Sharma presented in the same magazine regarding the interview published in the weekly weekend of Asad , 2046. ]
"
17277,"Ganesh Raj Sharma, while studying at the University of Atalism ( whether he is in the process of recruiting even in Banaras ?
"
17278,"There was also aalism. )
"
17279,"For the first time, for the first time in the period of more than 30 years, it has been concluded that it has been concluded twice a week and has exchange of courtesy.
"
17280,"I would be happy to see such a person by using my full intellectual power over the published details of the interview weekly on the tape !
"
17281,"Regardless of the debate necessary - even in the issues I raised and on other intensive issues.
"
17282,"But Ganesh Rajaji now kept his thoughts publicly, and again I did not have the need to raise it earlier.
"
17283,"Immediately I was bound to have two reasons to raise my pen.
"
17284,"Second , v . P . Why should I follow after calling for sister-in-law sister-in-law to be cautious about the reason for the ability to attract Koirala ?
"
17285,"I also tell the future of the country I thought of the power represented by the argument of Ganesh Raj, who kept the illness on my theory.
"
17286,"Where do I start ?
"
17287,"In this situation, I will make my statement more clear on every topic raised by reading every paragraph of Ganesh Rajaji's article.
"
17288,"There are no 16 paragraphs !
"
17289,"In reference to the first paragraph
"
17290,"Comparing to a common citizen of Nepal like a man, Novel's prize in Poland is like the insulting revolutionary article of Valera.
"
17291,"That too, I want to believe Ganesh Rajaji that loyalty to Wales for Poland and the feeling of prosperity for the people of Poland is also in Nepal for Nepal and Nepal.
"
17292,"So, the foreign aid which has come to a great extent, its influence and achievement reaches to poor Nepali people.
"
17293,"The answer to this question is not to give Ganesh Rajaji a former economist secretary.
"
17294,"He can be honest about his analysis.
"
17295,"Ganesh Rajaji , even though he knows everything , one thing is not known.
"
17296,"The recent government in Poland has the role of old countless debt burden, after raising the U.S. financial capability by asking for more support.
"
17297,"According to Mr Versea's dream, Poland's future is still to be built.
"
17298,"The other thing Ganesh Rajaji has not remembered.
"
17299,"If Nepal does not want foreign assistance to the question of political process, if the Sri Lankanists take American help to keep political development going on in Poland, do not they ?
"
17300,"If even the rule of rule governed by rich countries in Poland , would be buried down in the eyes of Ganesh Rajaji , even if Mr. Ramesh buried .
"
17301,"Even after reading the statement of Ganeshjeejji, he himself is a democratist, in his statement about foreign aid, I am trying to make a small amendment.
"
17302,"Keep this unanswered government out of this help.
"
17303,"Such governments will then be able to use other aid coming after sleeping after the government coming from the democratic system.
"
17304,"I am not anti-foreign aid.
"
17305,"Do not give Ganesh Rajaji to the monopoly that welcomes the help of his country building.
"
17306,"But where I say about foreign aid that is used as a weapon of exploitation and counter-regulation policy and behavior.
"
17307,"In reference to the second paragraph
"
17308,"It is like that in Ganesh Rajaji's main complaint I have been in India's economic development.
"
17309,"I am not a follower of anti-India or anti-China nationalism.
"
17310,"Regardlessly, the subcontinent countries of the philosophical philosophy are also developing, and where there was no earlier, the democratic state system is also developing respectively.
"
17311,"So, as appropriate as Ganak Rajaji's macrojale, he feels appropriate to him, he is only selfish to the realistic and other regretful powers in the society.
"
17312,"In fact , the difference between ' Laos , Vietnam and Cambodia and Nepal ' , ' Pure economist ' could not be understood.
"
17313,"But Ganesh Rajaji should understand.
"
17314,"Cambodia , I have not seen the statistics of Vietnam.
"
17315,"Again Burmese "" military socialism "" of misery by my mention of the Democratic samajavadakobarema mean that , he also did not understand.
"
17316,"Now there is something about Singapore.
"
17317,"40 years ago Singapore ( not even a separate state at that time ) and Nepal is not close to how close to Nepal's economic standpoint.
"
17318,"After all, I am putting it guarantee interview Kathmandu Pashupani free or not before they were finally Mathadhis my monastery , do not have right now.
"
17319,"Instead, anti-democratic radical democrats, Communists ganesarajajijasta tarkamabhanda things that some force is , to me that would be equally invalid.
"
17320,"Communists are at least bourgeoisie whether it is not democracy's job.
"
17321,"This is his theory , in this argument there is no sense of social discrimination.
"
17322,"I do not think that Ganesh Rajaji did not understand these odds and this Chhatriai.
"
17323,"Do not let 2057 do it right now.
"
17324,"Regarding the third round of paragraph
"
17325,"This is why Ganesh Rajaji has been overlined.
"
17326,"Me alone supports me that economic growth does not stuck in democracy.
"
17327,"On the other hand , I also make the point of personal intervention.
"
17328,"I do not say that he was extruded with intercourse.
"
17329,"My prayer is that when there is more interference with the basis, no one can abduct his freedom.
"
17330,"If not only prayer but his freedom seems to be embarrassed, I will hurt the human rights organizations.
"
17331,"Alarm , if there is a contraceptive, despite the need of democracy for economic development, the trend of waiting for economic development for democracy is also in the new way.
"
17332,""" Democracy and Economic vikasasamgasamgai for existence compelled to go with ' Ray.
"
17333,"How good it is to read more !
"
17334,"But what should be done by democracy and financial development as well as the democratic economic development is becoming awaited ?
"
17335,"To keep the democracy happening in the country, with more than 18 months before placing the democracy together, to show the flap from this method in the country.
"
17336,"Now the democracy took place after 30 years of departure.
"
17337,"The patterns of these two human needs are you going to walk along ?
"
17338,"My idea of ​​foreign aid is very polished by Ganesh Rajaji and his backsteps.
"
17339,"The thing arises here again.
"
17340,"Therefore, it has become duty to remind him more.
"
17341,"The basic point of view is that foreign aid is also a means of domestic revenue or savings.
"
17342,"The system of use of such resources makes political process.
"
17343,"The people are struggling to get the help of foreign aid with the help of foreign aid.
"
17344,"Do not mislead the illnesses seen in the health sector.
"
17345,"Overseas people in the field of trade are looted . Zi . L . Has applied
"
17346,"What school open ' license ' need - ' free ' primary siksakonimti also.
"
17347,"However, the public has opened an open license practice to sell business from the dollar by earning blood.
"
17348,"So clearly speak together , not many foreign - help children after the people had risen from tuition and survive famine.
"
17349,"Experts of how much foreign aid is available in Nepal is not Henry Kinsner.
"
17350,"With the name of a small man like a Kiszer . P . There may be a great deal of love like Koirala.
"
17351,"Because a large number of people do not have to look at the statistics of figures , facts , and that is not their work.
"
17352,"If I do not believe in the world as much as a special knower, this is a matter of concern.
"
17353,"According to the bank received the comparative data according to the most recent year ( 1987 ) , foreign aid Nepal received $ 9.
"
17354,"When Bangladesh's share was 15 dollars , 8 dollars in Pakistan's part and $ 2 in India's share.
"
17355,"Five , six , seven and eight cute
"
17356,"Ganesh Rajaji has sent a question about democratic socialist theory and behavior.
"
17357,"In the same discussion, this debate can not end.
"
17358,"It continues to be a human society.
"
17359,"I do not have to be under the absolute proprietary state of the means of production in democratic socialism.
"
17360,"I have expressed my interview in Sweden that Sweden did not take nationalization policy.
"
17361,"Ganesh Rajaji speaks more fatally in France.
"
17362,"Ganesh Rajaji has accused me , saying that I was buried in the foundation of feudalism.
"
17363,"It is a matter of knowing why he should fall down so much.
"
17364,"In my view , the character of the Nepalese newborn structure is different from medieval feudalism.
"
17365,"Even the exploitants of that time, their feet were on their own feet.
"
17366,"Although they had earned property from exploitation, their savings would have been to increase the business of the country.
"
17367,"At that time there was no foreign power and support to fill the feudalists.

17368,"Dynamics Explore : Uninterrupted Bugs Inside Indravati
"
17369,"1. Progressism : Changes
"
17370,"The countries with communist political system have traditionally analyzed the values ​​of art , literature , and cultivations by the dialectical approach.
"
17371,"The method of viewing and analyzing the current life of the world has also been established materially.
"
17372,"In real sense, the current life is flowing on the basis of diverse needs and many wraps exploring mobility.
"
17373,"The flow of mobility in life remains in the same way as communism and non-imperialism.
"
17374,"It can not be confused by the political system.
"
17375,"People in the society are automatically moving.
"
17376,"Nepali society life - method of the progressive effects of attraction is not free of course.
"
17377,"The economic method of this society is given in the Semi-Semantic tradition.
"
17378,"The fact that Nepalese life has been automatically adopted in the process of progressive progress.
"
17379,"Christopher kadvelako thinking - procedures can not be relied Unlike human progressiveness.
"
17380,"In this way, the Marxist society - a vision of human development in the history of classical or ethnical where the eternal search for the progressive value is accepted.
"
17381,"This eternality should be considered to be the achievement of global progress.
"
17382,"Yathasthitimulaka realism and overall realism of realism analysis is divided into two field.
"
17383,"In this way, if two types of analysis are given in a cheap way, the first can be called bourgeois realism and the last is known as progressive realism or socialist realism.
"
17384,"This last progressive realism also shows two branches - Critical realism and socialist realism.
"
17385,"On this basis some talents are trying in Nepali literature area , in which novels like Ramesh Vikal , Parrata , are seen very prominent.
"
17386,"Ramesh Vikal is the nutritional of critical realism.
"
17387,"Their efforts reasonable and informed approach ' continued flows Indravati ' novel stands as eloquent.
"
17388,"In this way, semi-feudal rites and newborn predictions are going to develop.
"
17389,"The social view of social , economic , political and social life is also seen to be cautious.
"
17390,"Life beneath ' what's happening , the already and what should be ' to naniyali hommine gradually trend is nearing its end.

"
17395,"In the context of the novelist, the long-suffering devotees have tried to establish the fame of the novel, not to come to their tale of reputation.
"
17396,"Ramesh Vikkal, the author of the story collection in ' Virano country ' in 2016, is now tired of a long history of three decades.
"
17397,"Nepal's social system also appears to be changing soon after the arrival of Jesus in the twentieth century.
"
17398,"After the year 2007, the feudal system which was overwhelmed in Nepal became semi-feudal trend oriented.
"

"
17400,"In this perspective, the values ​​of art literature and cultures were also present in front of us by dividing and dividing.
"
17401,"But all of these programs have been shaken to the political direction in the rituals of Nepali society.

"
17406,"In the context of Nepalese literature, Ramesh Vikal is also in the novelists who are expected to resolve the various differences of Nepalese society.

"

17658,"Later, Bhima Mukha met him at the same hotel and sent his address and I wrote the first letter to him.
"
17659,"And our letter was started.
"
17660,"He wrote in the first reply - I'm going to get away soon , so write a few days later on the address.
"
17661,"In addition, he had sent the Badoda address.

"
17671,"I did not count
"
17672,"Our marriage took place in Fergun 2027.
"
17673,"We opposed our marriage from both of us.
"
17674,"This wedding of different adventures did not accept the family of both parties.
"
17675,"That's why he too came to Suki Pokhari alone and I was also a bridegroom from sister -in- law's house.
"
17676,"Even after marriage, we did not come to Kathmandu , Uttu Uttao Pokhara and started living in the house of Bhai ( Sherchan ) brother.
"
17677,"When we reached the earthquake, he started to hit him and hit him , and his wife behaved very well.
"
17678,"Then we stayed there in a separate kitchen, after 6 months.
"
17679,"After 6 months, we did not want to go to Kathmandu.
"
17680,"The Neerari society was not like that today.
"
17681,"I was naturally difficult to run in a culture , environment, and society, to be able to adapt to the culture and environment of the world.
"
17682,"That's what he thought - we had to go to Hutuda.
"
17683,"There is our home - land.
"
17684,"There was no army and no one to care ( asagopala ) also gave us shelter was advice.
"
17685,"But Nagendra Thapa did not let us know.
"
17686,"Go there if your "" carrier to "" do away with it , so you can just sense that he should stop them.
"
17687,"I missed too much.
"
17688,"After all we did not go.
"
17689,"After that, we lived in Sagol and only stayed for a year.
"
17690,"There too 8. More than 10 years later, we have built houses in Maharajgunj.
"
17691,"Swimming and Swimming
"
17692,"I was just married to him - he used to sing only in Gopal Yongchan music.
"
17693,"He used to practice both the guests sitting at home.
"
17694,"This is the case that he has doubled Meera and Gyanu Rana.
"
17695,"Later, while singing in the music of Divine Khilling, he used to spell at home.
"
17696,"He , a musician , was not listening to songs by listening to the song.
"
17697,"But it is not always possible for singing for a month.
"
17698,"The shortage of time started to stir.
"
17699,"Otherwise he started practicing by listening to the cassette.
"
17700,"For the songs of film, he used to practice in "" sound track "" .
"
17701,"In the lyrics of the song , a flute , a violet, or a viceroy was drawn , and he used to practice it.
"
17702,"He has all sang songs that Ranjit Dai ( Gajmer ) has played.
"
17703,"Later 2 When it was anxious to hear the difference in 4 days, he used to pass that song.
"
17704,"I also helped in choosing songs and music to him, but the final decision was to be alone.
"
17705,"Sometimes I did not like the song I loved.
"
17706,"He did not sing where he felt.
"
17707,"He often had to tell me all the songs and I liked everything.
"
17708,"Harivakash Kathu has given him a song to find out that he is ""a stranger to me . ""
"
17709,"The written song in his sign is still with us.
"
17710,"I ran a cassette player always uses the return - not , tape has some full - not - jamcdathem.
"
17711,"It always seemed good to hear that he did something new.
"
17712,"In that case, I have 2 songs of the song. I had heard three tunes.
"
17713,"The tune of the tune that is from the radio today , the first time , by selecting the cache enclosures on the ground , I heard it.
"
17714,"Once again I loved it and I did this.
"
17715,"He also made a joke - "" So, you stole the sunisakyau privately , I will "" surprise "" would strengthen bhandaithiem.
"
17716,"Another interesting event about this song is.
"
17717,"He had to tell someone about his new songs from the telephone if he was only one of the oldest brothers.
"
17718,"They used to talk about one-hour conversations.
"
17719,"I sat on the telephone's receiver, and he was listening to a hungry boy playing the hormoneum.
"
17720,"Sometimes the sequence of famine was on the backdrop and sometimes the song of the song was released in his will.
"
17721,"Later, when peace came down, he did not even consider this rhythm.
"
17722,"But when he recorded, he did not listen to anyone's advice - we recorded rhythm as our mind.
"
17723,"But today the same tune is dear to everyone.
"
17724,"He had never been able to make his decision.
"
17725,"I have only seen recording two of his songs.
"
17726,"That too his deeds.
"
17727,"One day he said - everybody rushes to the radio to see my record, why do not you know why.
"
17728,"I also thought why , why not ?
"
17729,""" I love the virtue "" and "" record you forget "" .
"
17730,"One of the things at that time still reminds me.
"
17731,"He had to stay alive.
"
17732,"That day there natikaji brother , Dr . Raman was also the tutors.
"
17733,""" You bhulda "" that song "" that you survive without notice muskurayau "" That was a row.
"
17734,"DR . Tertil asked him to quit and ask - "" What are you saying?""
"
17735,"He immediately answered ""-"" that girl's name is. ""
"
17736,"We listened to it. ""
"
17737,"I felt like it was in my first experience - there is nothing more to do with alarming things like watching the recording.
"
17738,"Repeat the same line - repeatedly .
"
17739,"Now could "" track tuition "" is - pieces can be arranged by singing , it was time such arrangements.
"
17740,"Narayanogopal and Radio Nepal
"
17741,"He always complained about radio Nepal.
"
17742,"One of the country broadcast - via , that the government owned , Radio Nepal, he said that recording was a good law should be.
"
17743,"But when recording there, there would be no one available for exclusive music vendors.
"
17744,"The teachers of the discipline also did not have much to say.
"
17745,"The musicians who had rampaged themselves and battles themselves had also gone to tea when the recording began.
"
17746,"It was difficult to start dating at the beginning.
"

17769,"If the special work was noticed at that time, then the ticket would be cut off.
"
17770,"Despite this, even if someone entered a ticket without ticketing and showed the program, he would be compensated for his repayment.
"
17771,"That's why he became a very lucky person.

18026,"Even after the sovereign power comes into the hands of the people, the representatives of the people who are elected from the public can adopt any of the republican or statutory monarchy.
"
18027,"On the other hand, democratic movement should not be fulfilled if the sovereign power comes to the hands of the people.
"
18028,"That movement is not complete even after the establishment of the republic.
"
18029,"Some people think that the republic is a principle of communists.
"
18030,"Communists believe in republic.
"
18031,"That's true.
"
18032,"But the republic is also among the capitalist democracy, and some of the capitalist democratic parties in the world have fought for the republic and do it.
"
18033,"But even if democracy is maintained , the capitalist , capitalist democracy can not be considered as successful.
"
18034,"Like all backward countries , even in Nepal , democracy can be successful and complete without any new democratic revolution.
"
18035,"In this long process of democratic movement, the question of transferring to the public is universal.
"
18036,"However, while maintaining a democratic system in Nepal, the primary and early question has not been resolved for a long time.
"
18037,"Thus, the politics of the last four decades has become an important part of the country's sovereignty.
"
18038,"King Tarbhavan announced the Constituent Assembly in the interim constitution of 07 , but there were various types of conspiracies for taking his power in his hand quickly.
"
18039,"That thing did not have any special significance and importance for them.
"
18040,"For such interim constitution, King Tribhuvan does not give any credit.
"
18041,"It is likely that he wants to focus power in his hands , there is no harmony between the interests of democracy and the monarchy.
"
18042,"King Tarubhavan says that the abduction of the rights of the court and the attempts to maintain their direct and vigorous rule once again.
"
18043,"As stated above , according to the Constitution of 07 years , the Constituent Assembly had to be announced only in the year 2007.
"
18044,"But soon King Raja Turboban and later Mahendra saw that such anarchy threatened to exist in the existence of monarchy.
"
18045,"Therefore, a plan has been initiated against the Constituent Assembly on behalf of the Rajdhavar.
"
18046,"So when they did not formalize the election of the Constituent Assembly, the constituencies of the constituency were constantly delayed and delayed.
"
18047,"The result was that the elections in 200 years would end only at the end of 2015.
"
18048,"The . Cu . Instead of the Constituent Assembly, after accepting the Parliament's election on the basis of the constitution given by the king.
"
18049,"After leaving the slogan of the Constituent Assembly, there will be a parliamentary election . P . It was said - "" We lost fantasy , we got the realities. ""
"
18050,"His opportunist , unprofessional and wrong approach is largely accountable for the Panchayati dictatorship system, which is maintained in the country for 30 years.
"
18051,"Of course it is ""to a great extent "" because it is primarily responsible for the monarchy.
"
18052,"017 vegla year to prepare the background - with different political parties with various - in different ways contributed to the king.
"
18053,"For that, decisive and primarily . Cu . Responsible , whose agreement with the king concluded the election of the Constituent Assembly last.
"
18054,"People tyovaheka Council , Vice-democratic party and the Communist Party of tyasakalagi vegla - with different amounts are accountable.
"
18055,"The . A . Pa . She could not survive from that kind of trumpet.
"
18056,"There is a long history of such type of conflict within the party.
"
18057,"The second episode of our party ( 2014 ) clarified the need for the struggle to be fought by clarifying that the king was conspiring against the Constituent Assembly.
"
18058,"The Darbhanga Plainam ( 2018 ) struggle against the ruling King of the majority reached extreme levels, in the Rashtriya Annonation ( 2017 ) , Rayamajhi group was expelled from the party.
"
18059,"Today, in our country, the new history is replicating in the old history.
"
18060,"In that situation, the old history associated with the question of the Constituent Assembly and the Constitution can help us to understand the present situation.
"
18061,"But how weak is the foundation of democracy in the absence of sovereignty ?
"
18062,"How big did it make a deal by compromise in the question of the Constituent Assembly Election ?
"
18063,"017 years told
"
18064,"Today again, a multi-constitutional constitution has come before us and is based on its elections.
"
18065,"In comparison to the Constitution of the 2019 constitution, the universal power in the present constitution has been implicitly accepted in the public.
"
18066,"Land that has been kind of constitution , on the basis of legal monarchy is not the place to be divided.
"
18067,"Of course, during the construction of the constitution, we should compromise on our side weaknesses by eliminating our statements and based on limited achievements.
"
18068,"But at the time when the wing of the rising rise and the global support of it, it was really a betrayal of the public to withdraw the back of the movement and withdraw from the movement.
"
18069,"The . Cu . The leaders of this repeat repeatedly - it was not wrong to withdraw the struggle.
"
18070,"At that time, they had devoted their objectives to multi-party system and legal monarchy.
"
18071,"According to their interpretation, the objectives were fulfilled and the constitution declared on December 9 had proved that.
"
18072,"So today, the constitution , "" black "" and "" regressive "" batauneharukaviruddha they are to grow the fastest are attacked.
"
18073,"To explain this, we need to consider the new constitution.
"
18074,"The main weakness of the present constitution is that it was not manufactured by the Constituent Assembly.
"
18075,"The Constitution prepared by him on the draft prepared a lot by King and Congress too.
"
18076,"What exactly is the source of the Constitution for us ?
"
18077,"That matters more and more importantly.
"
18078,"If the election was held by the Constituent Assembly, the real source of the Constituent Assembly was public and the power to transfer the sovereignty to the people was like lightning day.
"
18079,"But, in the form of the method or constitution of building the current constitution, the basic question is not resolved.
"
18080,"Read the constitution, the king announced November 23 as per the declaration spastasita "" We inherent constitutional power and special rights "" have been mentioned.
"
18081,"Street conditions of Valley : Problems and suggestions
"
18082,"Kathmandu Valley is moving towards urbanization with rapid speed.
"
18083,"During urbanization, the number of households is increasing at the rate of thousands.
"
18084,"In that sense, the city's city can be more than just the development of urbanization more than urbanization.
"
18085,"The situation of the road seems to be one of the main reasons after seeing many problems during the urbanization of Kathmandu.
"
18086,"It is not just a problem that is not necessary in the street.
"
18087,"Due to lack of maintenance of the roadside roads, there has been a lot of difficulty.
"
18088,"There is a lot of houses in the area due to the lack of schematic roads in the Baneshwar area, which is the most dense settlement of Kathmandu.
"
18089,"Samakhusi Sanepa of Lalitpur , Lagankhel , manabhavana , Ani and the same is true of jaulakhelatira.
"
18090,"How are roads ?
"
18091,"The planned housing system of public roads because most local people is coming - your personal property is made to leave.
"
18092,"After construction of raw roads, the process of becoming a strong road seems to be very unusual.
"
18093,"In order to blacklist any urban road, local people will be required to provide recommendations of the respective vendor and head office.
"
18094,""" Where is that only ?
"
18095,"It's just a pitch to understand how important it is , "" says a staff of the Road Department Planning branch.
"
18096,"But important to separate the adharaharumadhye "" Access is also "" that the new residents of the village to come Kuria contact: Krishna Atreya are confident.
"
18097,"Eventually, there was work through one of the reachers.
"
18098,"According to them , seeing some places including Maharajgunj and Thapaath , the street-colored road is seen in private homes.
"
18099,"They all are important. ""
"
18100,"Importance but not public
"
18101,"City problem
"
18102,"The problem of road inside the three cities of the valley is its own.
"
18103,"These 5 % of these eclockes have to be hampered to reach four ports and the motorcycles of Tempo.
"
18104,"The road to this city, which is home to another house, is the homes left behind in the house.
"
18105,"Such situation is in most parts including Sukukaloka , Toothadi of Bhaktapur , but the old part of Patan is not less than Kathmandu.
"
18106,"However, compared to Kathmandu and Patan, the management of slope development of Bhaktapur has been good.
"
18107,"Even though the streets inside the city look small, they are busy looking at the pedestrians.
"
18108,"Low roads do not waste the roads in such roads.
"
18109,"But the road bike , jog , bike and road position that while it pours temposamma looks very bad.
"
18110,"Do not drive the way ...
"
18111,"It is very visible in the Valley to find the only way to build a house, not only the road to see the road before making a home.
"
18112,"That's why the later searched bats have become narrow.
"
18113,"The slope exhaust and dirty molding problem does not work properly.
"
18114,"In this context, waste waste management committee said that in the Valley, the worst waste problem problem in the valley has been in the towers.
"
18115,"The water of the road inside the house
"
18116,"The road was shaken after the first water.
"
18117,"Getting over the yearly shaft, the surface of the road is found very high in the surface of the house.
"
18118,"However the road has not stopped moving.
"
18119,"There are many houses in Baneshwar and Vijaybazar in such flags.
"
18120,"What importance to which road?
"
18121,"Due to the loads of traffic of the Valley roads, it is not properly classed.
"
18122,"Due to which requirement of excessive traffic roads also has not been able to concentrate and expand.
"
18123,"The slope and water pipe underneath these roads seem to be more troubled.
"
18124,"Not only this, limited width of Gyaneshwar Sallaghari road from Maditvi Chowwoti seems to be inadequate for one-way ride.
"
18125,"One-way segment
"
18126,"According to statistics obtained from the Department of Railways, there are a total of 518 km of roads in the valley.
"
18127,"It has been blacklisted only 254 km, and the remaining Khandasimath is 163 km and the road is 101 km.
"
18128,"Many of these roads have been hit by blackmail.
"
18129,"However, with regard to concrete study regarding urban traffic planning and road traffic, seeing a wide range of roads, one-round rules have been taken in some broader roads.
"
18130,"But road management does not appear correctly before implementing this rule.
"
18131,"Regardless of the improvement of the road, this rule seems to be only one-purpose objective.
"
18132,"Misery , darkness, and again ...
"
18133,"In the same way, the rules for water supply and sewage should be submitted to the road office before the vacuum pipeline is dissolved.
"
18134,"But the maintenance of the road does not appear in the time.
"
18135,"In connection with this delay in the related branch of the road department, the drinking water and sewerage institutions were informed that the news should not be stopped at the time of work.
"
18136,"As we work, we give it information on the day of work or the next day to the street office. ""
"
18137,"An engineer related to the road office , Vishnagaragar , had a distinct opinion.
"
18138,"Even if it is talked about, it is automatically weakened.
"
18139,"Moreover, the connection between drinking water and dried pipe does not work properly if the water is eroded, the road is also being damaged.
"
18140,"Can not walk water and drained pipes without road ?
"
18141,"Of course, but budget budget is that costly budget with us ?
"
18142,"A responsible official of the road department asks.
"
18143,"So it is consumed , it is finished and .. The process is not a quick startup process.
"
18144,"Road speed and driver's death
"
18145,"Rainwater flows on the road due to rainfall , there is no need for the road to be needed.
"
18146,"In such water and hilly-moving roads , the means of running the water and the hills are running , we abuse the driver.
"
18147,"But we have not given attention to the condition of the road.
"
18148,"On the other hand , the loyalty of the driver , pedestrians , and traffic police is also tremendous to us.
"
18149,"Drivers and pedestrians say the traffic police is an oppressor.
"
18150,"The traffic police always sees the driver as a prosecutor, and the pedestrians think foolishly without riding knowledge.
"
18151,"Due to accident and accident
"
18152,"The number of accidents in the year has increased due to the busyness of street roads and road shortage.
"
18153,"Due to the increase in the accident, pedestrians , driver and traffic police have shown each other to the accident .
"
18154,"However, there are only one consensus on the road management of all parties.
"
18155,"How much and why are the vehicles ?
"
18156,"German citizen working in the World Language Camp . Troy says - "" 75 per cent of the private cars in Kathmandu are worthless. ""
"
18157,"Similarly, the Panamic Enhancement Project, Tim Lider of Bhaktapur, is seen by American citizen James Dennis, to move from Bhaktapur to his residence in Dedikot.
"
18158,"But Nepal's trend is oriented towards the lack of pipes on the ground.
"
18159,"So , in the year 2037 , there were 15 , 204 fuel driven vehicles in the valley , and in the year 2041, till 30841 reached Asarar.
"
18160,"This number has reached 42451 in the year of February 2046.
"
18161,"On the basis of the figures mentioned above, compared to 2037 years, the number of vehicles now has doubled three times.
"
18162,"What is the pollution except for the accident ?
"
18163,"It has not been studied.
"
18164,"However , if the roads in Kathmandu valley are kept and if the roads are covered, it has come to a distance of six kilometers.
"
18165,"Parking problem has also been complicated with this old age.
"
18166,"Everywhere there are schools, but there is no choice for it.
"
18167,"There is no effective way of controlling speed control of the girls' road.
"
18168,"No sound disorder ( Horn is prohibited ) on the hospital , if there is an example of all of these illiterate examples, then it is longer longer.
"
18169,"What is the situation in the coming years ?
"
18170,"City development
"
18171,"But according to the law, work committee members do not look so effective.
"
18172,"What to do and can do
"
18173,"Due to the means of transportation and mass density, within the next ten years, many roads will feel narrow.
"
18174,"That is why the construction work for the next 50 to 100 years should be considered as a way to build roads.
"
18175,"Due to sustainable development and good management, it is not appropriate to repay the lake or work time.
"
18176,"Road construction , roads and street lights is not fashion , that where others see only good.
"
18177,"M . NO . 1989, made me love for the day of Phygus, and my child Lalita Kumari took away the infidel of the newborn in the space for ever.

18180,"Trouble came with a friend who came alone.
"
18181,"If my mother was living, my father would not only be my only one.

"
18185,"Then I'm sick of Mathritar's disease.

"
18851,"Contacts and conversations with vagina help Sali to put a new way and direction to put her in the future of the world.
"
18852,"Similarly, after Vijayuju's murder, his wife was killed , Sally should be treated as fortunate , like income earnings.
"
18853,"This relation between Sally and Vainju is ultimately social.
"
18854,"If we look deeper in our society, Sali and Vegetables are not limited to socialism only.
"
18855,"Due to economic reasons, the relation between salty and vagina is deep and dark.
"
18856,"2020 years ago.
"
18857,"There was a ruler , I knew.
"
18858,"His mother-in-law was not a male or female child.
"
18859,"She had married the eldest daughter.
"
18860,"His wife, two sisters , unmarried were.
"
18861,"The property was abundant.
"
18862,"The officials were concerned about how to handle the property of the in-laws.
"
18863,"After years of international women, the property of father - mother who did not have children is a legal arrangement for self-determination.
"
18864,"Earlier, the law did not provide such a facility.
"
18865,"There was a lot of excellence to handle the property of the in-laws.
"
18866,""" Rival "" that the sister of humus asset as hear the word greed ranacandiko husband at that time, his sister's marriage became agree.
"
18867,"Anyway, Menwasni had no opinion about sister-in-law not allowed to marry.
"
18868,"The ruler sent a wife to ask for a sister-in-law.
"
18869,"Mrs also spotted a sister from a parent by showing heavenly things.
"
18870,"Boss turns grinding and grinding aphnosathama mother Sharmila - laws who care for them.
"
18871,"At that time, there was no one to destroy them.
"
18872,"He had no marriage.
"
18873,"On the other hand, a sister-in-law was unmarried because the in-laws' property was still not sure to take her hand.
"
18874,"Something was written by the younger sister.
"
18875,"As long as possible, the desire to marry a good young man is in all the young men.
"
18876,"Two - two sibling sister as a woman enough for her husband because her husband near the pardainathin bujhisakeki attitude.

"
18880,"By marrying three daughters, Hakim deposited sole authority over the property of in-laws.
"
18881,"If Mitti is poor and there is no right to marry, Mitti has tried to trace Sali in her brother's womb.
"
18882,"If there are wealthy in-laws, Vijayuju does not have to use any remedy to distinguish the goods , prices , punishments , and to punish Sally .
"
18883,"Otherwise, the love story of Salivinju's family is still interesting and exciting.
"
18884,"In the in-laws village as much as their sister's sister's needs are for her daughter-in-law.
"
18885,"Likewise, a neighbor of the sister-in-law also has the flavors of all the saris.
"
18886,"It is a folk song that has been made in love with such love -
"
18887,"' A , Brevity ! '
"
18888,""" The sister said ? '
"
18889,""" Where to go ? '
"
18890,"' Looking for love. '
"
18891,"The rituals of salci and veneju also are intuitive and attractive in our folk culture.
"
18892,"' Pure fun , phuklo whose laughter and Baucau ! '
"
18893,"For many years Mitti could not find a boy and marry her, but sister-in-law has also added a marriage relationship with her husband, and it is easier to get rid of the mantra.
"
18894,"In that way, Mityi's reputation will not be able to push her face and also bear herself unwanted by cheating.
"
18895,"A parable is not to say ' Sally should be stolen , ' the coward does not have to cook. 'In our society.
"
18896,"The same illustration is also known when a coconut is cooked without a vegetable or intake.
"
18897,"As soon as the love of salari and vagina starts , they can easily become a vegetable vegetable.
"

"
18900,"Even the modern ones who love the romantic love of Vijajju, are not found to be found by the society, even if they are made by a group of clues.
"
18901,"Thus died from the dead
"
18902,"Though Iraq and Jordanian border are said - No Mens Land ( human capital ) , millions of people are filled here.
"
18903,"Actually this is no longer the land.
"
18904,"Because there are also no minimum infrastructure requirements for people to live.
"
18905,"Here we can live with animals - there is no basis for living.
"
18906,"Sand sand around
"
18907,"It seems - we do not have any other substance except sand.
"
18908,"Tree , barley , grass is not visible anywhere in the grass and the water is not visible.
"
18909,"Looks like it was as if it was just a sandy soil and an oily water.
"
18910,"Trampled heat of 52 degrees Celsius.
"
18911,"Keeping flowers in the sand, it can easily catch the condition.
"
18912,"In such a situation, how difficult the situation should be to stay there when there is a camp of people living in the number of millions ?
"
18913,"It is difficult to guess.
"
18914,"In such a situation I am also a Nepali man.
"
18915,"The camping site is called ' Raman ' .
"
18916,"Living in Palan , staying in India is Indian , Bangladeshi , Pakistani , Sri Lankan , and Filipino.
"
18917,"Some may have experienced tranquility relief from tents and vessels from government level.
"
18918,"But there are many people who are struggling to make a glass of woven garments struggling with the expected warmth of the afternoon and the way of the night.
"
18919,"A - Looking forward to returning to your country.
"
18920,"It's an event today.
"
18921,"Kwat taat eleven days
"
18922,"Lucy - hidden items too.
"
18923,"I could not even find two ' Khusha ' ( wheat bread ) and a glass of yogurt, which was provided by the Jordanian government forever .
"
18924,"The line of cowboys and curders is about one and a half kilograms of meters long.
"
18925,"There were also Indians and Pakistanis in the line.
"
18926,"The nature of the dog and viralajasta by these individuals - back to bite too quick to fight not only utrihalthe feel.
"
18927,"That's what happened today.
"
18928,"There was a difference between these two sides.
"
18929,"The police were difficult to distinguish.
"
18930,"In fact, in the same situation, the Jordanian Police also showed the police as they showed in their riots.
"
18931,"I.e. Sticks Charging and Fading.
"
18932,"People scattered.
"
18933,"At the separation of the bull, I was like a bull.
"
18934,"The same two Khuspas kept for the sake of Khan also went to Huldong.
"
18935,"As a result of my disordering heat, my body and my village reminded me of being disturbed when I was suffering from my body.
"
18936,"We are very happy when Nepalese people are abroad.
"
18937,"The burden of the dream that we are looking for from our country is not something that we carry out a figurative form of the same dream and weigh on our home.
"
18938,"Where does everyone dream of becoming a Dhanapatra ?
"
18939,"Only those who are merely the only ones can get their desire.
"
18940,"The rest of the world would have to remain in the same grief and suffering as well.
"
18941,"The difference is that - the way to get suffering and suffering is different.
"
18942,"Talk to me
"
18943,"My home is in a mountainous village in Nepal.
"
18944,"More and slope by 60 / 70 ropani of land.
"
18945,"If I have to cultivate well, my family expenses for years across the year.
"
18946,"But the village reaches India and Hong Kong to become young.
"
18947,"The culture that should be made after the son is prone to my village.
"
18948,"It is not good to earn afterwards.
"
18949,"Heavy load has brought.
"
18950,"Yes, that is why young people should be hungry and forget all the misery that remain away from their country.
"
18951,"And, with a tenth trip, it goes on becoming a carpenter again, this sequence is going on.
"
18952,"I also got the money to bring to the farm to Kuwait.
"
18953,"How much will I earn in six months when I live there ?
"
18954,"Fortune thousand rupees were to pay for broker of Kathmandu.
"
18955,"He had sold five rope gare fields to gather forty five thousand.
"
18956,"Mahli told me that she did not want to buy the fields, "" If the father of Ramay, who sells the deposited property , gets coarse , Alkalin says.
"
18957,"Do not do that.
"
18958,"Instead, just like sadness is just here.
"
18959,"Your birthplace is its own.
"
18960,"The pain of the place is far better than the happiness of the place. ""
"
18961,"But my ghost was going to go abroad.
"
18962,"I did not have any questions about anyone.
"
18963,"I wanted to be a little late with little work.
"
18964,"So, as it was, I was ready to be aware of what happened.
"
18965,"Mahali was convinced to say - "" You do not worry, Mahali.
"
18966,"If Kuwait can stay only for two years, then four lakhs of rupees are earned.
"
18967,"You can say that you can live in this mountain and earn a million rupees every day ?
"
18968,"Can not be
"
18969,"I am not only Nepali to go to Kuwait.
"
18970,"There are many more.
"
18971,"The greater the amount of money played by the ancestors.
"
18972,"Just leave for two years.
"
18973,"Then I will make you gold , gold , earrings, and earrings.
"
18974,"I will add another farm to all the farming planters.
"
18975,"You a lot - a lot of foods.
"
18976,"Work with three four employers.
"
18977,"Stay calm.
"
18978,"What is more happiness than this ?
"
18979,"If you consider yourself ""
"
18980,"Already did not agree.
"
18981,"After hearing about the jewelery and becoming a mastermind, there was no controversy and had touched the tears of aroused tears.
"
18982,"After reaching Kuch, I felt very null and wonderful.
"
18983,"Looks like a big home.
"
18984,"The sand is empty.
"
18985,"Forest , joys , and challenges, some not.
"
18986,"People are too few.
"
18987,"Due to all sours of petrol and dollars.
"
18988,"Their standard of life was above us.
"
18989,"The dogs who do not want to do anything work hard.
"
18990,"In the hope of dollar , those who seek poor and wealthy countries like Nepal , India , Pakistan , Bangladesh have gone there to sell their labor.
"
18991,"And I came as a servant.
"
18992,"I had to take care of the night.
"
18993,"My master's name was Mohammad Khalid and his company's name was Real Estate Company.
"
18994,"That was a big company that traded gold and diamonds all over the world.
"
18995,"The company consisted of more than 150 people.
"
18996,"All of us were given underground rooms to live.
"
18997,"The caterpillar was in the canteen company's company , which we were bitten by the money-consumed amount.
"
18998,"I had 200 yrs, i.e. about 600 dollars per month.
"
18999,"Let's think the flame now.
"
19000,"Which Nepal receives such a huge amount in Nepal !
"
19001,"Prime Minister If you do not get more than 8,000, what about others ?
"
19002,"How much will I bury ?
"
19003,"Guess yourself
"
19004,"Some of the Nepalis who entered Kuwait were from poem in the poem, although some were Palmaweek and some of them in Fantun.
"
19005,"Similarly, some Nepalis were also working on the Kunwati border rigging and Bhindari.
"
19006,"Although Kuwait is a small country, there is a lot of physical facilities.
"
19007,"General cars were also seen in the house of Kuvati.
"
19008,"Each member of the family used to have one car.
"
19009,"The underground houses were built air-conditioned.
"
19010,"Even though I had previously been difficult to adapt to there, I was able to get there from Vienna Vora.
"
19011,"Our common contact with them was less when the common dogs spoke in Arabic.
"
19012,"Water from the stream seemed to be expensive than the petrol found in Nepal.
"
19013,"A drop of water was not seen.
"
19014,"Water was hot , as it was boiling , it could be showered in the morning only in the courtyard outside the fireplace outside the courtyard , otherwise it was not possible.
"
19015,"The drinking water system was different.
"
19016,"The past events in my mind started coming as a sequence of video cassettes.
"
19017,"Why at night at 9 o'clock?
"
19018,"It's getting cold
"
19019,"A blanket had to play a knife in the night.
"
19020,"The sweat of the day and the part of the sandwiched sand, scolded the body till the end.
"
19021,"Sand sand was found in whatever part of the body.
"
19022,"Like the black skin of the body, I felt like the body's skin was lost.
"
19023,"If I want to take this face with my face, what do the villagers think of me ?
"
19024,"Do they know what suffering millions of foreigners like Kuch in Egypt like far away from the world events ?
"
19025,"Devika lives, brave and poor village shrine as large armies and hinges - comments will be destroyed.
"
19026,"What courage and courage do I face them ?
"
19027,"Are there enemies too ?
"
19028,"How much more can you get rid of reality ?
"
19029,"In what part do I walk ? ""
"
19030,"An Indian woman sitting in the nearby tent was heard crying loudly.
"
19031,"It turned out to be my mind.
"
19032,"He had been in Kuwait for ten years.
"
19033,"With full family
"
19034,"There he was asserted as a rich businessman.
"
19035,"He was a believer.
"
19036,"But nighttime, Lakhpat became angry.
"
19037,"His son was suffering from morning.
"
19038,"Due to the lack of water and medicine, the children had become very skeptical.
"
19039,"Maybe she might have left her last breath at the same time !
"
19040,"As humanity, I had to go to comfort him.
"
19041,"It is my religion too.
"
19042,"But this was not just an incident.
"
19043,"In one camp within a camp, usually twelve twelve elderly children died.
"
19044,"It was normal to die.
"
19045,"Instead of helping and comforting others, it was more aware that how to live.
"
19046,"This selfish feeling was also in me.
"
19047,"So she went to India.
"
19048,"Do not even think about it.
"
19049,"There is no sharp sunlight in the summer.
"
19050,"The air covered with a swimmer is not covered.
"
19051,"There is no water for drinking , there are two cheese and one glass curd for food for food.
"
19052,"No medicines.
"
19053,"An instability and uncertainty environment has created a kind of fear in all.
"
19054,"It was a mystery that humans were able to live alone and I did not ask anything other than God - just giving life.
"
19055,"Indeed, after man's death, it was very scary.
"
19056,"That night's mind is in my mind.
"
19057,"I was in the lord's bedroom.
"
19058,"My favorite flat was to protect.
"
19059,"The sound of a cannon ring was heard in ear.
"
19060,"I guess the dogs are training dogs.
"
19061,"Smoke smoke around
"
19062,"Extreme odor.
"
19063,"Dust dust
"
19064,"How bad
"
19065,"Two floors above were scattered.
"
19066,"I ran into the room under the ground and searched for the owner to phone.
"
19067,"But the telephone itself is unable to work.
"
19068,"Nightcloth did not hear anything except the ammunition.
"
19069,"The building collapsed after a break.
"
19070,"I thought - today is the last moment of life.
"
19071,"Because there was nothing except ammunition and fire around me.
"
19072,"But living in the underground room was saved.
"
19073,"In the first half of the morning, the Iraqi armored vehicles and the army came through the rugged road to the whole city and took control of the city.
"
19074,"Then YES - these things decreased.
"
19075,"- The Iraqi army entered the city and where - where people were seen, there was a blind fire shot dead.
"
19076,"Two walks saw that the bullet collapsed.
"
19077,"Before the bullet was fired, the army would neither warn nor did it ask.
"
19078,"- Someone from the car saw an unidentified army.
"
19079,"The car stopped.
"
19080,"People screamed I did not ask anything.
"
19081,"Once the blanket empty up the machine.
"
19082,"He died there.
"
19083,"The army took the young car , clock and Benfica took the ring.
"
19084,"- The army walking on the ladies saw.
"
19085,"First, he did vampire work with him and then he was scolded by Josiah Sangin.
"
19086,"Some were scolded and some were scattered by bullets.
"
19087,"The troops went on large food stores , gold and diamond shops , valuables and banks.
"
19088,"If people are there, they become the first to become and then put all the items there and burn it in a looted building.
"
19089,"Like Kuwait's spring full of fortune, Kuwait City has been ruined in two days.
"
19090,"Thousands of people died.
"
19091,"There were often foreigners to die.
"
19092,"For 60 / 70 thousand kuvetiharu summer vacation time European countries were amusements.
"
19093,"So leave.
"
19094,"That's why the entire city was very terrorized.
"
19095,"The foreigners have disappeared.
"
19096,"There is nothing , food , water , electricity.
"
19097,"There is no money.
"
19098,"The bank wasted.
"
19099,"I stayed in the underground room for eight days.
"
19100,"Please be satisfied with what I had in the room.
"
19101,"That period was a delusion to die and live.
"
19102,"At that time, Iraq had devastated Kuwait in its own country.
"
19103,"Iraqi rule was implemented there.
"
19104,"The situation became normal.
"
19105,"Now, leaving the country was a great task to save life.
"
19106,"But how to leave the country ?
"
19107,"For the pocket expenses, the parsha was the soul of life.
"
19108,"It was so little that anytime could end.
"
19109,"I had two hundred dinars.
"
19110,"At that time, that dollar was found for $ 600, and at that time only fifty-five dollars were found.
"
19111,"Genghis Khan dreams of becoming a great machole of us who eat little macholai nirdhaharule had to suffer , lose their lives to be made.
"
19112,"Nation building and status of Nepal's population
"
19113,"Similarly, due to the possibility of global warfare, the possibility of mutual understanding and ideological diversity not allowed the Cold War to be started.
"
19114,"In this situation, nations in the last two groups began to seek their way and find ways to get the prestigious place in the world community.
"
19115,"As the last conclusion of this quest, the nation's identity was identified in the ineligible.
"
19116,"Consequently defeated and undeveloped nations concentrated their attention to national prosperity.
"
19117,"The fact that national unity was an alternative way of achieving its existence, was the realization of the Indian Empire in the Asian class.
"
19118,"In fact, from 2013 to 2047 years, it has been developing various periodic plans and has developed various aspects of the national economy.
"
19119,"M . NO . From 204 9th, the eighth scheme has started implementing democratic feelings and the welfare and national needs of the national environment.
"
19120,"Creation of a nation is a serious challenge
"
19121,"Like other countries, our country is not free from this exception due to the resources and resources of the poor.
"
19122,"At this point, our country also has to be considered as a major challenge to the nation.
"
19123,"Studying only the creation of essential infrastructure needs is only as per the achievement not available for the past three decades :
"
19124,"Irrigation facility 5 , 50 , 467 heir
"
19125,"Electricity facility 2 , 73 , 084 km . Or .
"
19126,"Traffic 7 , 128k . Min .
"
19127,"Education ( literacy ) 39 percent
"
19128,"Hospital No. 111
"
19129,"Despite the tremendous effort of industrial prosperity, only two percent of total labor force can be provided employment, indicates the inability to develop the area.
"
19130,"Role of people in nation building
"
19131,"If the basic basis for nation-building cooperation campaign is economic development, it is only thinking about national needs, if planning is a plan.
"
19132,"Source and instrument remains an important role in making this thinking a tangible form.
"
19133,"The idea of ​​planning can not be achieved as a task, and the complexity of the development and construction can not be resolved.
"
19134,"In fact, developed countries of the world are the obvious results of the true use of the human brain and the operation.
"
19135,"While studying this perspective, the masses have a decisive and serial role in nation building.
"
19136,"In fact, calling a public heritage is the educated and capable manpower of any country and the technical manpower in terms of nation building.
"
19137,"This manpower has been very low in developing countries.
"
19138,"Status of Nepal's population
"
19139,"To develop the development of the national economy or in the absence of nation-building technological manpower, it is undoubtedly impossible.
"
19140,"Likewise, supply of 44 , 146 only on supply is about 7 , 386 technological deficiencies.
"
19141,"Management of existing public heritage
"
19142,"By the end of the Seventh Plan, the accumulation of technical manpower is estimated to be around 50 thousand.
"
19143,"In addition, decision-making on December 4, reducing the number of vacant vacancies, the number of permanent permanent manpower is still reduced.
"
19144,"When studying this perspective, our manpower management side experiences a lot of slim in the background of national needs.
"
19145,"It is essentially to meditate on this fact completely.
"
19146,"The current policy on manpower management of the government
"
19147,"The existing policy on Manpower management of Mr.5's Government can provide some information from the Development Administration policy mentioned in the summary book of the Eighth Scheme.
"
19148,"Employee bureaucracy programs have been used as a phenomena in other areas of public administration, including public administration.
"
19149,"The service laws are also improving.
"
19150,"Development of civil service and manpower
"
19151,"Consequently, it is merely traditional , formalized and used only.
"
19152,"In this sense, it has not been able to play a particular role in manpower development.
"
19153,"This is a paradox in favor of Nepal's manpower development.
"
19154,"This body is not above the position of 2017 years, despite the number of foreign directors and foreign advisors and external resources and resources.
"
19155,"It's probably a failure.
"
19156,"The Public Service Commission is also the institution to provide the necessary services to the professional and administrative provider of the necessary manpower.
"
19157,"It is also not working to provide stability to the technological manpower.
"
19158,"Nor has it been done for the protection of manpower.
"

"
19427,"The number of people who started working in society by seeing the most talented talents of Mr. Parasmani Pradhan and his progressive progress was also increasing.
"
19428,"The number of opponents of the Nepalese medium went far more.
"
19429,"Tibetan , Bengali , Bihari , lapce community leaders of all the Nepali people and the Christian Missionary Kalimpong means the government has come up against - his protest - letter.
"
19430,"Mr. Parasmani, who stressed that the mother tongue should be read to her mother tongue , should be read in Nepali schools in this school's schools.
"
19431,"But the general public did not have any concern with the Nepali medium - they did not understand the subjects and did not even try to understand.
"
19432,"Some intellectuals who understood the subject were in government work because they did not open their mouths.
"
19433,"Anyway, Nepali people had to explain this subject.
"
19434,"To do so, he got a golden opportunity - in an annual episode of Nepali literature convention.

"
19440,"When the conference members of the conference took my name, I felt like I was one of the parents of the mother tongue and I am very pleased.
"
19441,"The next speaker raised the subject about what the word was spoken on the third day.
"
19442,"When the historical writers of the literature do not follow the third day, what should be considered in the anniversary of the literature convention without considering the literature ?
"
19443,"I'm looking forward to thinking about it !
"
19444,"This meeting was disrupted.
"
19445,"The meeting did not specify any specific topic and I am in danger.
"
19446,"Dear !
"
19447,"No, you may be ordered to see what is going on.
"
19448,"I'm looking forward to the subject of the subjects that are especially attracted to you.
"
19449,"Of course, Eli's heart is not attracted to Capitol's trick, otherwise it would be rare to see you here at this time.
"
19450,"We are all one mind Alley ' Language and Literature ' - the sea is paurikheliraheko.
"
19451,"Come , take a moment to insist on language and mother - literature tellers look.
"
19452,"Dangerous work is of a dramatic.
"
19453,"Our Nepali heal me through this together, especially the master of divination - the pouring of seeing at night.
"
19454,"On the third day, the villagers gather at the worship place of Dhami and they show the danger.

"
19456,"True true that those who live around that the deceased Gupta.When niskun "" Lahai God ! Letting the water, let the water chutyai "" said upon it.
"
19457,"When Tess Dhami be asked to give a talk or to give them a vow - tied customarily collect.
"
19458,"Dear !
"
19459,"You might have to say that today the literature should be heard about what the literature was about.
"
19460,"The reason is simple.
"
19461,"Interestingly, our everyday people are interested in getting ridiculous - dance , killer - dance , sageari and worship.
"
19462,"My e-bookmate gave you only a little support on your psychotherapy, and I would like to think that my thoughts are upset.
"
19463,"Let me remember this celebration for a moment.
"
19464,"My e-paper and pen are reminded of slums and yards.
"
19465,"Guru - In the morning prayers, the dams go to the worship of Mahakal Baba to worship and worship.
"
19466,"Today, your doubts have also come to a dance hall with a variety of shelves.
"
19467,"On this occasion, you have started showing the risk of mother tongues.
"
19468,"But today's risk has taken a look at the look and depth of the sky.
"
19469,"In Nepal, after seeing the dangers in the form of a dangers, then it is necessary to see the devils pulling out the dead bodies on the day of full moon.
"
19470,"But the British did not hesitate to enter the temple, which has come to Marxist.
"
19471,"This is the quality of the English.
"
19472,"Now let me look at the mother tongue a little longer.
"
19473,"Nepali Mother tongue is often a mother tongue of millions of Nepali people.
"
19474,"But why does not our mother's voice listen to such sweetheart ?
"
19475,"Due to honey speaking, our mother is due to Madhya.
"
19476,"What was the sharp and clear statement of the mother tongue ?
"
19477,"We do not know his children as a result of illness.
"
19478,"Sick mother ministering to so far , the mother sick in spirit to find just how subtle nakaccara children are worthless ?
"
19479,"In this way, I see the heavenly Bhanwakak , Raghunath , Motimam , Homnath , Padmanabh Adika , walking around me .
"
19480,"E Dead - The hearts of the souls seem to be seen as disturbed by the failure of their mad mother.
"
19481,"They seem to be angry with us.
"
19482,"These may be the ghost we awake to shrink from time to time .
"
19483,"Tell me the ghost to the heavenly soul.
"
19484,"I'm sorry about this.
"
19485,"But thus , the world's ghost is shocked , the awakening.
"
19486,"These ghosts are happy to be God.
"
19487,"Today, whose death - spirits are called ghosts or gods, how we walked in our lives in the living condition.
"
19488,"Heavenly Bhanwakak served as a mother in bed or died at the maternal uncle.
"
19489,"Heavenly Padmanabhas taught the mother tongue in the morning and heavenly Homnath served Nepali language during the stay.
"
19490,"And Heavenly Raghunath stirred his maiden mother on his poor lips.
"
19491,"What happened to us today and thus stop watching our mother ?
"
19492,"Why are we disturbing today to strive to serve Madhya Pradesh ?
"

19756,"The forest heritage of the country known as "" green forest - wealth of Nepal "" is often destroyed today.
"
19757,"One estimate, nearly 60 years ago, Nepal's total land - sixth of 60% ground - Part covered with dense forest, meditating, said recently 9 percent and -10% in the proceeding are estimated.
"
19758,"There is a lot of reasons behind the destruction of the forest, one of which is the supply of energy as well.
"
19759,"In such a way, country is being resurrected by cutting annually for the supply of fuel for fuel supply in the country with water resource capability that can give light to Asia alone.
"
19760,"What is the biggest distress for the Tragedy nation ?
"
19761,"2. What is the basic element of the problem ?
"
19762,"Nepal River - sewer main two reasons nahunupachadi used judiciously.
"
19763,"The first internal radio number.
"
19764,"In the long run of Renaissance, the Rana has never paid attention to national interest.
"
19765,"During the Panchayati regime, the national heritage instead of national development and progress has only been destroyed.
"
19766,"Foreign aid and debt operations of the projects Panchayat regime, "" commission through making "" were.
"
19767,"When the project was selected, the factor was considered as ""the amount of commission "" and "" test of foreign donor organization "" than national interest.
"
19768,"It was more applicable in the water source.
"
19769,"At the Mercury Hydropower Project, the cost of the same power was the cost of US $ 3500.
"
19770,"The cost price hikes, "" commission machinery "" because that is the respective experts say.
"
19771,"In the latter half of the Panchayat, policy makers and technical employees are not limited to saying that they are limited as "" commission agents "" .
"
19772,"Most of the rivers in Nepal were from north to south due to reaching India.
"
19773,"Hence, India wants to control its water resources.
"
19774,"So India Mahakali , Karnali , Gandaki , Koshi River with his rights and pashmina "" shared river "" as a desire to take.
"
19775,"However, due to lack of trade condition between the two governments regarding the purchase of Karnali's electricity - the project is now tired.
"
19776,"Because these rivers are "" shared "" in the eyes of India .
"
19777,"3 . What is international practice regarding river use ?
"
19778,"The river, which is associated with the region or economic interests of two or more states, is called the international river.
"
19779,"The border of the two countries lies in the boundary of the border between the border and from one country to another.
"
19780,"The needs of the coastal countries related to international rivers are utilized according to interest and understanding.
"
19781,"It does not raise the question of bundles equal to competition or arithmetic.
"
19782,"The situation of the international river is not "" open "" or the jurisdiction of any nation is the internal river.
"
19783,"Whenever there is a question of shared river , sharing of something is the condition of the Res Communis .
"
19784,"Such objects are in a group and having eaten calanaantaragata - tell your strength , ability on the basis of desire is the trend.
"
19785,"Such seafood forms such as sea-sea , continental shelf outside the Continental Shelf , space zone and Antarctica.
"
19786,"In this sense, there is fundamental difference between sharing a river and being international.
"
19787,"International Rivers have great rivers.
"
19788,"But shared rivers are rarely found.
"
19789,"The Nepal - India joint release issued by the Prime Ministers of Nepal and India last year was named "" Shared river "", the river that was run from India through India .
"
19790,"Even though it is not understood or understood by understanding or not, the concept of "" shared river "" will definitely make a loss to Nepal.
"
19791,"The rivers which flow from India to Nepal can be called in a limited part of the international river but it is impossible to surrender to India as "" Shared Rivers "" ?
"
19792,"It is thoughtful.
"
19793,"International river basin countries were concerned about how to use that to practice the following four principles are common -
"
19794,"1 . The theory of absolute territorial sovereignty Theory of Absolute Soverignty -
"
19795,"This principle protects the rights , interests of the upper coastal state .
"
19796,"2 . Pradesiya absolute integrity principle (Theory of Absolute Territorial Integrity) -
"
19797,"This is the opposite of the first principle.
"
19798,"This principle preserves the interests of lower coastal states.
"
19799,"In 1939, in the case of Indus River in Pakistan and in 1925, Egypt had advocated this principle in the Nile river dispute between Sudan and Egypt.
"
19800,"3 . Theory of Limited Sovereignty - The limited principle of sovereignty -
"
19801,"This principle has governed the sole rights of the river, and the use of rivers is being used by all states, as it is called judicial use principles.
"
19802,"4. Community theory (Theory of Community in Waters)
"
19803,"Unlike the principles mentioned above, everyone has traditionally rendering the world's fourth principle for the purpose of using the river, which is called community theory.
"
19804,"According to this, regarding the use of each river, affiliates associated with the river river should establish an economic unit and all should jointly use the river maximum.
"
19805,"It should be built and managed in the United States on the basis of investment and need of all the members of the community to gain mutual benefit.
"
19806,"The practice of the river is not a rupee in the practice of river.
"
19807,"It states that the states are directed from national interest rather than legal recognition.
"
19808,"Such a stand , India has been taken from time to time in talks with Pakistan , Bangladesh and Nepal.
"
19809,"Racket ground

19817,"Labor investor and agricultural laborer.
"
19818,"Pariiyo Thalu, who became a lonely place, became a landlord.
"
19819,"This was the position of land , the state's patriot life and the true identity of Nepal's basic agricultural economy.
"
19820,"Now let's go to the original topic.
"
19821,"Who is the land !
"
19822,"Tell the Joker to keep a witness.
"
19823,"Perhaps this is the correct answer.
"
19824,"But here, who can tell the motor to the driver, but it is appropriate to answer the investor as finance, to raise the question of ownership.
"
19825,"If the vehicle is a temporary means of production, land is the means of producing meaning.
"
19826,"So the ground and the vehicle can not be compared.
"
19827,"Not nasabana ground , and swept away the ground of the intersection, and it ground to dust matomuni - Board members is a constant accounting.
"
19828,"It is there.
"
19829,"That is why the earth is considered to be superior.
"
19830,"See science , and geo - value is described.
"
19831,"Keep track of the world in the west only the land is found.
"
19832,"The most warriors that describe the magnificent attributes of the land Martha land for the earth, are as much as they are.
"
19833,"Hey food

19834,"Are you happy , you even make anymore pranai Nepalese people - tongue is not the same age from the ages, saying.
"
19835,"Even if there is a cow, the remaining cow does not have respect , the milk giving cow is respected and respected.
"
19836,"It is not sure that our Hindu philosophers have passed away in the process of seeing heaven as a father and earth mother, meaning that they are not rendering to be tempted.
"
19837,"Here is the subject of racer land.
"
19838,"Nepal's rulers and their allies danaba administrators named by the latter basically three geo - ownership of the ages, it seems the old pattern.
"
19839,"There is a racer , two bulls and three winners.
"
19840,"A mother was made here three times.
"
19841,"I have been able to present my story about the creation of the Gupta and how to be done and in the same chapters about the land.
"
19842,"Here, here I am trying to figure out the excellence of the racer for the reader writing a separate article on the racer.
"
19843,"If someone separates the question from the exact future, then I see this work being processed.
"
19844,"I have known that the land is to be fixed and it is the truth.
"
19845,"By this production increases and the national treasury, real - revenues, dividends have been acknowledged as the key to the idea.
"
19846,"That's why my heart stuck to the farmer.
"
19847,"I have peace in this.
"
19848,"Both the houses are very old and old.
"
19849,"I have placed adhesive with tape.

19853,"Lunch , dinner , peaceful times moved and settled in the wind Now I Nawa.
"
19854,"In one mind, I think my two lady would be depressed before me.
"
19855,"But if I had a wealth of farmer than my property was, according to the demands made by the farmer's union in my lifetime, it would be more delightful.
"
19856,"Here we have to talk about racer land.
"
19857,"The racer land is such a land.
"
19858,"He is not a liar and not a fool.
"
19859,"The same land can be rich and plowed in the same land or the land can be rich and one another.
"
19860,"This type of land has occupied the maximum area in Nepal.
"
19861,"Land owners should be given to the local freight office in the year of land or land.
"
19862,"In other words, one can say either a trick or a dog.
"
19863,"Local goods mean government office to settle land land in one district.

"
19873,"I do not have to say anything in the context presented to the opponent of my opponent.
"
19874,"But I'm always saying this with a strong persuasion.
"
19875,"When this policy was changing many aspects of the state system, no one did the work of the farmers' class.

"
20445,"Let's explain some pictures of the original cadre of the Redhead Camppa.
"
20446,"Yak and so many modern buildings in front of this seem to be like shaking it , feel as if it is shining .
"
20447,"The main part of my childhood that laladarabarako barriers - bad condition when it was dim, deserted , no one had made toward that part of Bass.
"
20448,"While there, the roof of the 10 - 15 other vanaraharuko was a pest.

20453,"Having a tree 3 - 4 Ota S - small vanaraharu seen wriggling.
"
20454,"As a result, one of us started to stone them.
"
20455,"First of all, those monkeys were about to escape, but if the stone collapsed, what would happen to them suddenly.
"
20456,"I did not hit my mind , I am innocent , so I could not understand anything , but where was it ?
"
20457,"After all, do not wait.
"
20458,"If we become discreet in man, it was my own sin to seek justice from those animals.
"
20459,"There was also a strong sense of mine.
"
20460,"Whenever those winners started attacking all of us.
"
20461,"We ran away all the ladies.

20463,"From then on, I reached to be friends among friends - Dhanshyam could run quite well , brother.

20464,"I also realized that if I run, I can win others.
"
20465,"Since that time our competitions in sports and competition have also been added as a new dimension.
"
20466,"This game was often the first to me.
"
20467,"Later, when I was in the tenth class, I had to run in Trivakura once again with Tolliya partner Abyapani Gautam.
"
20468,"It is also surprising to remember - how he had won in the race even though Abhayana was more than me in various games.
"
20469,"Is it perhaps one of the natural skills and strength I get after childhood in other sports ?
"
20470,"But I could not continue with it, or the opportunity to receive it , so I am deprived of a potential winner to pain , failure, doing obedience.
"
20471,"Even though I have learned to ride for the first time in my life, the Redhead is within the campus.
"
20472,"Friends of such games with fellow friends still enjoy the joy of feeling in mind.
"
20473,"Now let's mention something about a small accident that was left behind by cycling at the moment.
"
20474,"The month was in the winter - December - maybe on the back.

20476,"Recently - I learned to have recently learned how to climb a bunch of acrocarbohydrates on a bicycle, and I often used to be the father's bicycle vacant, in a quietly redundant campus.
"
20477,"As a result, a bicycle handle has been giving my chilli a lot of fun and it's fun.
"
20478,"It is the first time we have a great deal of bicycles.
"
20479,"Some of the friends now gave me a lover called Ghunshyam, who was about to ride a bicycle.
"
20480,"Then we had the idea - the skin to revive the ride janindaina injury.
"
20481,"Democracy , democracy, and democracy again

"
20495,"Amritsar , the cocktail of Amrit and poisoned poison ?
"
20496,"Sometimes I feel like a person is inadequate prisoner of his own sad predecessors.
"
20497,"Yes , my life is a hollow democracy and - three times already.
"
20498,"Three deadly pictures of democracy have been cast in the minds of heart and suffering.
"
20499,"The pierced pigeon pistol and the blood of my mother's blood-hearted heart - the first picture of the democracy.
"
20500,"The infinite long dark sunset and the vicious pain of my brothers inside the sunset - this is the picture of democracy.

20507,"I was perplexed and appalled at myself and rising - is democracy unfortunate that my own life ghumdaiphirdai - three times the prince ?
"
20508,"The first democracy in my life was in seven years.
"
20509,"From now on, the horoscope passed away, and when we cultivated, our eyes flowed very much in pieces, leaving Akhund Kihiland on our nose.
"
20510,"Even though seven years , democracy is not in the heart of my heart , it is fresh on the surface.
"
20511,"When I see the voice of democracy , thorns are still scared in my yang.
"
20512,"I can not say how democracy came to the capital ; But in the remote settlement of the Far East , in that dark darkness , democracy was called tragic.

"
20527,"No, there was scattered vegetable , annapatamathi stranded gel pickles , Half cut a corner of the leg hold and posterity gindieko injured pigeons.
"
20528,"I remember the sad mind , when the mother woke up in the pierced paw hand , tears off her eyes.
"
20529,"Seven years of my democracy can symbolize these are these two things - the wounded pigeon and tears of mother.
"
20530,"Strange democracy - AAS and ahatakari !
"
20531,"The democracy came to the village - hanging on the stupid and cutting the paragraphs !

20535,"After all, when fifteen years came, he took the shadow of the election and came to the village's dusty village.
"
20536,"The choice of the two was beneficial to me.
"
20537,"Singing songs to Khwang on one side , found sweets sweets on the other side.
"
20538,"The taste of sweets and bitter songs were sown - the mark of the voting box and the box of the Nepali Congress.
"
20539,"What is the vote and the box ?
"
20540,"What is the tree and the mark ?
"
20541,"I did not mean
"
20542,"I meant that sweets.
"
20543,"So I thought , now came to democracy.
"
20544,"But when the seeds of democracy came to the village , he spent it.
"
20545,"Earlier, the school opened to be a Guata of Malachi language.

20550,"The village servant carried the service of the village in a secret manner - Briya beaten the daughter of the head of the head and beaten Kulalalam.
"
20551,"Such a surprise , the mysterious industry, which developed the democracy planted for the development of the plant in the village , ran to the capital.
"
20552,"In the meantime must be , my village was riding itihasamapahilo minister.

20553,"I felt like seeing the picture of the ride , the minister of democracy , I was a dancer of the dentist and the dancer.
"
20554,"And , what about the hypocrites of the masked village of that monster , see the obedient dogs found as well as the chief priests.

"
20556,"On the right hand side of Batghata, the villages of the Karapore village have become a rampant ride from the heavenly heavenly heavens.
"
20557,"Minister came.
"
20558,"The pancakes and the vessels of the ground were consumed.
"
20559,"He stirred his royal way to some extent, and he did not know how much he felt.
"
20560,"A tremendous question in my mind started from a tremendous size - from what is democracy ?
"
20561,"Gauta Manne of Machachachhi language and daughter of Mukherjee's daughter of Guruji Vishari's Bhandadi ?

20573,"Still, we heard the ears on hearing - Who to whom to whom ?
"
20574,"Sadly , no one came to answer to our ears.
"
20575,"The Congress and the Ganges were like a secrets of a remote country - listening to fear , not to understand the drainage.
"
20576,"Pull Dhalnatha later.
"
20577,"No intelligent alien village and the old story of the Flood, conferring halesari whisper - now it is cracked.
"
20578,"Can you live ?
"
20579,"Then the open-hearted doors opened the senses in the heart of the ignorant villagers and started the sensation of the sunset !
"
20580,"As soon as the Congress name was called , the faithful servants of Gathagadi twisted their new name - the international element !
"
20581,"The new names of the names now disappeared in the beginning.
"
20582,"The life of the village was unexpected - always anxiety , acrobatical and desperate.
"
20583,"So , the villagers filled flowers and filled thirty-five magazines to the news that heard from unknown ignorants.
"
20584,"Someone put a string in the yang of the news , someone raised the horn.
"
20585,"Someone hungry , somebody's lord's tail.
"
20586,"After this, distracted news started making ear from ear ear to ears, by threatening the people's embarrassed heart as a scary jamraj.
"
20587,"An international element, when eating food, is in the pan of the king's army, and orders to hunt the victim.
"
20588,"When the grapes arise , the bullet breaks in the neck and the bullet covers.
"
20589,"People say groaning - jumbo , gasam adkera died helpless !
"
20590,"Another international element is in the trap of soldiers with a bribe gun.
"
20591,"The king's soldiers play with his life as if he is a kidney failure.
"
20592,"The soldiers of the soldier eat the pit with a scary hunt.
"
20593,"Again , a flute falls on a trap of hunter hunter.
"
20594,"Hunters press on the trenches of tapping hunting , the helpless hunters start laughing.
"
20595,"Hearing and telling those brutal stories of Nepali gas chamber, people are waiting to wait for their turn.
"
20596,"So mysterious democratism - Uncovered by the booty of the sovereignty of innocent and innocent people, as soon as possible !
"
20597,"Why all this ?
"
20598,"The question arises in my mind.
"
20599,"Why kill them , kill them ?
"
20600,"What was his message to relatives ?
"
20601,"What was his model without missing the others ?
"
20602,"Did you like those who did not like them as a heroic hero - the dysfunctional offspring of personality ?
"
20603,"Do not know , do not know exactly
"
20604,"Of course , they were not in the village's life .
"
20605,"Was he interested in the publicity or unbeliever ?
"
20606,"It does not even know
"
20607,"The fact is that , in Nepalese gas chamber, it was unusual , and after that they fell into arena in the Chinarivin palace of unknown martyrs.
"
20608,"From Basayon ​​to Brahmaputra side
"
20609,"Its value also increased to Rs . 16. It's up.
"
20610,"I looked at the book Orknife.
"
20611,"It is worth Rs . 15/85 the money was kept.
"
20612,"Is it a matter of time ?
"
20613,"Yes, even thicker cover what was right, ""thought bicarem.
"
20614,"Many things in the past started playing in memory.
"
20615,"The first edition of this book, about 34 years ago, Madan Prize Library, is worth Rs . 2. - was placed.
"
20616,"I wrote a lot of objections to Kamal Dixit by letter.
"
20617,"This is only time-consumed interruption which is Rs . 2. - Rs . 16. - arrived.
"
20618,"At that time I was a 24-year-old young man who was studying in postgraduate, today, I have reached the position of sixty-two sticks.
"
20619,"How do you get the time spent without having to spend time?
"
20620,"Looking back later reminds us of many things.
"
20621,"Three years back, remember that Bhavani Ghimire wrote his autumn journey in the title from the settlement to the side of Brahmaputra.
"
20622,"And after that title, I like to get something.
"
20623,"Basay is his own story of the novel, and its printing has another interesting history.
"
20624,"It's about 1954.
"
20625,"M. NO. 2011 is a year !
"
20626,"I beeswax I. A. I was a student.
"
20627,"The story of my story was lazy and some stories were also printed in Gorkhas.
"
20628,"Written enthusiasm increased to see their published works.
"
20629,"Basay novels Actually, I started writing a story on the mountain life by giving a title to the valley.
"
20630,"The story of the story was mentioned in the chapter from the last chapter of the novel, which is mentioned in the valley.
"
20631,"The story was tall , and where I did not find out how to finish it.
"
20632,"I did not prepare any advance form of the story.
"
20633,"A passion came, I went to writing.
"
20634,"That's why it was natural to not get rid of it.
"
20635,"A friend advised him to announce.
"
20636,"As soon as the novel says, I fall.
"
20637,"Could not find a tale of tale , more novels ?
"
20638,"Hunata a whole novel I am writing in the eighth grade, and the manuscript of padhdatakai more termites are not going, and whenever.
"
20639,"But she is not eligible to show anyone.
"
20640,"I wanted to use it.
"
20641,"So , some of the Kanyakyoti novels started , but with a precise form of the story , an outer frame was not ready before the account was ready.
"
20642,"Now, before pulling out a frame, I have prepared the frame of the story.
"
20643,"Writing work continued for a half and a half years in between.
"
20644,"At the end of such a vogue in the rest of the ten - twelve days finished writing.
"
20645,"Soon, the full-fledged hundredth page of the novel ended in three years.
"
20646,"Looking at the answer to the question about what is now the source of writing or what motivations - when I think now, I get lots of conversations.
"
20647,"First, there was a stroke to show realistic realization of Nepali life in me , or I wanted to keep social reality.
"
20648,"The same remimmer reminds us to be the basis of the memorandum novel and confirmed that the same incident took place with the mountainous Nepalis coming from Assam to the eastern Nepal.
"
20649,"If I found such a person, I would have to have a habit, if I could get a meeting by knocking down the door and kissing it.
"
20650,"Today, Nepalese Nepalis are unable to enter Nepal in this zenithal ban.
"
20651,"They allow restricted area - the letter should, which is not attainable.
"
20652,"Therefore, it is rare to see Nepali face in the hills.
"
20653,"In such auspicious Assam, original works of Nepali literature were unavailable when Nepali books were not shops.
"
20654,"Atonement gave me joy , but my writing process could not be helpful or catalytic.
"
20655,"About 12 years after the settlement, I got a good fortune to read outside Lansingh Bangdale.
"
20656,"Reading , it was Nepali reality after settlement.
"
20657,"The story and sermon after it is settled.
"
20658,"In particular, a peep of Nepal's life that has been achieved in the occupation of Darjeeling's occupation.
"
20659,"I thought - mulukabahiraaghi the mantra, almost a decade later, it moved to lekhiecha written.
"
20660,"But outside of the country of Bangladeshi, it is not merely related to the reality of outer life.
"
20661,"It has also been carrying a mental reality , conflict - opponent too.
"
20662,"The character of mental power - are oppressed and almost inhuman repercussions as capetindai paraatma and svaatmako are becoming even threatening.
"
20663,"It has also revealed the psychological truth of life.
"
20664,"So, not just realistic but psychological, it is not much more than realistic.
"
20665,"Similarly, Satyjit Rayko, based on the novel of Vyhuttyshushan Bandyapadhyay, saw the movie pictorial pattern.
"
20666,"Referring to Basit's writing resources, another thing seems like saying.
"
20667,"That's why I was recently a college student and economics was one of my subjects.
"
20668,"We had the name Karl Marx's name in the middle of a student just like a hugge.
"
20669,"I listened to his revolution in the name and economic and physical philosophy.
"
20670,"I did not have the knowledge of Marx's basics.
"
20671,"Just listening to the discussion , and reading a few light and cheaper books published by the Communist Party written by him, I was scared.
"
20672,"However , I bought a similar slave Marx's Capital , but I could not understand anything.
"
20673,"The move also indirectly - drafting has become a source of inspiration to admit.
"
20674,"From the point of view of illustration, not only Nepalese life but also the entire Indian country has become the true truth.
"
20675,"In Nepalese life, it has embodied ninety percent of the people's truth.
"
20676,"All of these are fantasy because of the incident.
"
20677,"The practice of moving settlement has become traditionally in Nepali.
"
20678,"From the mountains to Mades , Mades to Mughal , and Mughal , the Nepalese people are still looking at the new habit of looking for villages.
"
20679,"Nepalese Brahmaputrawari buffalo in Assam has reached the borders of Brahmaputra today , Arunachal , Manipur and Burma.
"
20680,"But not only the Nepali specialty but the practice of moving.
"
20681,"This is an event that is based on world truth.
"
20682,"The same is the birth of new colonies.
"
20683,"Moving written, and one - and two friends that I felt in connection with the draft.
"
20684,"After some writing, the print queue never happened.
"
20685,"Even today , many of my stories , poems , essays , and essays have added the favors of their own files.
"
20686,"Although the manuscripts are ready to give him a letter sheet, he is not sure.
"
20687,"But my partner is self . Chhattra Bahadur Gurung did not stay silent.
"
20688,"She was not very educated , but she was a man who understood the morality of literature and wrote her stories too.
"
20689,"He had a great impact on the settlement and brought it to light, to bring my syllabus to the well - known grandparents of Guwahati .
"
20690,"I heard

"
21148,"But it does not mean that it is old as human civilization and culture.
"
21149,"It was used at the time of celebration and happiness to show respect to worship , to give respect to their honesty .
"
21150,"In contrast, much importance of any unique and unusual type of material as Koseli was overwhelmed.
"
21151,"It is considered a supplemental medicine for special purpose, not to do the job.
"
21152,"The person who receives as something as a Koselli , gets nose burned , the face starts to shine and the sun is shaken.
"
21153,"It breaks the ray of hope in disappointment , makes the darkness light, and it can make impossible even possible.
"
21154,"Foreigners give good things to their country as a gift to relatives and friends of another country.
"
21155,"Even if made in their own country among the indigenous people, it seems that the choice of exchange of Koseli was run.
"
21156,"In our country, sweet food , items , and especially rare things were offered as Koseli .
"
21157,"Twenty-two decades, it stretched a lot of legs.
"
21158,"But Hosea Yo Koseli is also inactive.
"
21159,"Today, it has been found by Kosele , which can offer poorer than poor.
"
21160,"This coconut does not have to beg for any foreign, do not have to spend money , do not have to take a knife , take it in the car.
"
21161,"For this , it requires little intelligence , a little bitterness , and some oils are injured.
"
21162,"Everything you need only a little , a lot needed.
"
21163,"At the moment the time brought democracy.
"
21164,"Therefore, there is no need to offer Koseli to the flavors.
"
21165,"They do not measure.
"
21166,"Kosei is not going to offer another hajj.
"
21167,"Himself has chosen , their leader - more openly and in fact, the only man of his household needs.
"
21168,"In short, if you want to do good and good for your good.
"
21169,"The name of that case is ' Champa Koseli ' .
"
21170,"You may have to ask - is it found to the Casualik ?
"
21171,"It's easy to get it.
"
21172,"There are many parties in the public.
"
21173,"There are also leaders who rise in the party's vote.
"
21174,"Similarly, the government staff and the head of the village also have the help of mobilization and mobilization within the time of the vote.
"
21175,"Now you have to do - find such people.
"
21176,"This is the place to find Kasseli , the way to gather and place.
"
21177,"Yes , one thing to be careful - do not like other people who are in Kosseille .

"
21184,"Internal World : Outdoors
"
21185,"Nature and life are wonderful and wide ; Both have similar similarities.
"
21186,"These elements have caused the existence and attraction of both nature and life.
"
21187,"There are hot and cold nature , the tree - leaves , weeds - wild, and others.
"
21188,"If there is no balance between the power and nature of nature, the nature of life and life will be beyond our imagination.
"
21189,"The magnitude of the magnitude of the magnet's north point and the attraction of the southern point is to balance the nature.
"
21190,"These funds (+) and debt (-) marks are important in science , which keep the natural power in balance.
"
21191,"Based on this , electric - theory can also be seen , protein and electron in the center of nucleus is based on the electron flow.
"
21192,"But this article focuses on the importance of art by discussing nature and life, and external and internal world as mentioned above.
"
21193,"Nature or this world is on our side , we experience it by our knowledge - senses and think differently , it is a visible world.
"
21194,"So physical nature just as the body is conscious , knowledgeable is only visible sight.
"
21195,"Presence of the brain is essential for both , for physical nature and for body, and for body and self.
"
21196,"So the creators of intellectual superiority beauty - realization can , in creating are pre-eminent.
"
21197,"In this case, how can it be possible to create scientific or artistic creations ?
"
21198,"So the brain is true , svasvata , essentially , life or nature - spirit does feel.
"
21199,"Life is omnipresent, like power, it is incredible and continuous.
"
21200,"The above mentioned evidence is present in evidence and truth.
"
21201,"After the truth, after the truth, the savior of the world is revealed.
"
21202,"Sivamaya - quote or welfare of a subject is creator - mingled.
"
21203,"A person who can not discern Shiva can not realize the truth , eagerly without feeling like Shiva , and can not understand the time of creation.
"
21204,"Described above moral - sense a part of Shiva , the art - creator exists in the brain or internal world.
"
21205,"Sivamaya great sense of beauty or beauty had anabhuti the person , beauty - sense of art - creator base creation.
"
21206,"Beauty - sense of a person without passion , momentum , passion - passion , imagination , create a power can not touch.
"
21207,"Hence beauty - the sense of art - is the highest point of interest.
"
21208,"Ordinary people also experience the truth ; But Shiva and beauty - due to lack of awareness, imagination is less and less capable of creating them.
"
21209,"Artwork - The same is the difference between the creatures and the ordinary people.
"
21210,"Art - Sartma Beauty - The greater the extent of conscious power is the imagination and the creation of power.
"
21211,"Nature and body are visually visible, but brain or knowledge are the inner element.
"
21212,"Kalasrastako have experienced jnanendriyale items ( elements ), whether in nature or organ - pratayangama be - about their knowledge.
"
21213,"The appearance of these items is required.
"
21214,"On the other hand, the person is an internal world - which can be called brain or knowledge , so it is not visible.
"
21215,"Therefore, the element of motivation for the creation of self-sufficiency is an implied world.
"
21216,"It is self-created if it is influenced by the outer world ; Outside - The world and the inner - the relationship between the world is invisible, but always.
"
21217,"It can be said that there is a witch and a dream.
"
21218,"Some people are more conscious dream being "" a dream I'm seeing ,"" said his desire to awaken the dream or sleep.
"
21219,"Like the relationship between the outer and the inner world, the wretchedness can be a relationship between the wretchedness and the dream.
"
21220,"The person who created and strengthened the inner world is good.
"
21221,"These two worlds are complicated.
"
21222,"The proton nucleus with these worlds - neutrons and is ilektranakojasto , electron speed , power and a working relationship, not protons.
"
21223,"The inner world can not be activated without the action of outer world and beauty ; Blind , deaf or obesity are less conscious of this.
"
21224,"Mind (Psyche) i'm playful and powerful, and Create, - the power is full.
"
21225,"The mind is in the inner world, continuous observation and environment occurring in nature and society.
"
21226,"Without changing the outer world, the mind can remain lonely and inactive , as nothing can be done by electron without a proton.
"
21227,"Of this material was visual , the external world remains ; This change continues , its own self becomes unconscious.
"
21228,"There are two elements of mental and spiritual inner world.
"
21229,"Electron and proton are interconnected and nyutranajhaim based and are associated with , a - to complement each other are.
"
21230,"The spiritual sense of intellectual superiority count in life - sense does not , own wisdom spiritual ( metaphysical element ) shapes it.
"
21231,"Differences are not only the creativity or consciousness in the nucleus.
"
21232,"Sambandhajhaim time and the universe of internal and external world is the relationship , time and so also the ahanko.
"
21233,"Time is variable , self-esteem ; Time is not conscious , self is very conscious.
"
21234,"Self-life is the inner world , it is widespread.
"
21235,"Self alone anymore , it can catch and balance the mind as manobaijnanika and sexual - moment, play a good role.
"
21236,"Therefore, reliance with creativity creates stability.
"
21237,"Kalpanasanga self-control and sexual relationship with a measure to revive the sirjanasakti - sanvegaharule direct or indirect role in the final.
"
21238,"The Creator must accept the truth and reality.
"
21239,"Although the nature or life that exists in the form of objects or elements, the power to accept it must be in the heart.
"
21240,"This is the reality and the truth of physical or mental fort after he accepted moral - force or Shiva is Apparently feeling.
"
21241,"Truth Beauty - perception is , beauty - bodhanai accepted as the truth is.
"
21242,"So the point of art - the creator or scientific , art or science and harmonious coordination seems.
"
21243,"These are just like the same but different forms or sides.
"
21244,"Prejudice - free of charge is needed.
"
21245,"Accept the reality and the truth, but what does science bias , sastale also create and beauty - trodden suffer prejudice expressed the truth - Shiva - the beauty is unable to realize.
"
21246,"Political role
"
21247,"Now, I am also switched in Sikkim politics.
"
21248,"Even in the politics, I came to the full 15 years.
"
21249,"The government is running for 9 years.
"
21250,"During this long term, there was no joy in peace and peace.
"
21251,"In this period justice and injustice are natural for people.
"
21252,"In 1963, when the editorial editor of "" Our Call "" magazine indicated that it reached 10 years - Sikkim drew a moment.
"
21253,"Prior to 1973, Sikkim's politics was accounted for , vaccine - commented.
"
21254,"Unfortunately no one brought the right meaning.
"
21255,"The Vadora Range saw the world green and did not even try to see the roots of the earth.
"
21256,"Shepherds also ran on a pike only to straw.
"
21257,"As a result, in 1973, there was an opportunity to create a fake and fascinating movement.
"
21258,"Who got the benefit ?
"
21259,"That changed emotional movement and racial discrimination movement erupted Sikkim's history.
"
21260,"Tax , fear , raharama protest - marnele could ask for, and the ?
"
21261,"It is natural for the movement to go after the king becomes the first victim of the king.
"
21262,"Enjoy those who enjoy worldly pleasures.
"
21263,"Experience momentary pleasure , but turn to spiritual happiness upon - disasters beyond.
"
21264,"Truth says victory ... waiting to wait only to wait ?
"
21265,"...
"
21266,"The movement of 1973 was still not communal - Sikkim was the ruler of everywhere.
"
21267,"The head of the minority race was not a hiding place.
"
21268,"Trungeous Political Peace - There were many loaders coming to maintain security.
"
21269,"Sikkim's kingdom was destroyed by the king's hand.
"
21270,"So . On May 4, the day Mr. B 1 9 73 . S . Damn reached Nanni to assure the people.
"
21271,"Mr. B . S . I gave Sikkim's final speech to the court, but I did not believe it.

"
21273,"Be there . S . For the sake of fear, decorating the platform very well is waiting for a large number of people.
"
21274,"Bujhnekalagi prized ... .
"
21275,"That's exactly what I said just within 3 days.
"
21276,"So . On May 8, 1973, there was a nominal triangular agreement.
"
21277,"That one compromise kills Sikkim's mass movement.
"
21278,"Tinatakaka leaders of his movement - headed to introduce corrupt.
"
21279,"In April 1974, ' a man made a vote ' but would he call him a vote ?
"
21280,"What did the donkeys do in the box of wine and wine in wine and chure ?
"
21281,"People of Sikkim know
"
21282,"In that election, in 26 locations in 32 constituencies, I raised independent candidates because Sikkim had a question of life and death.
"
21283,"But there was no break.
"
21284,"With the palm of my friends scattered cunavapascat life - were scattered - I arrest him.
"
21285,"The dictatorship of the world is no longerhere in the world.
"
21286,"There was no place to seek justice in Sikkim.
"
21287,"All the political proposals from New Delhi started to pass.
"
21288,"This is so . On June 20, 1974, there was a day to pass the proposal to send a swimmer of Sikkim mother.
"
21289,"All Sikkim gross - against him, and his mother was raped, but to prevail in Sikkim, India saktikoaghi selfish netaharukasamunne to no avail.
"

21293,"We come - their responsibility nibhairahethyaum.
"
21294,"I lived in the "" Light of Sikkim Building "" at that time .
"
21295,"Hard look at the morning kept us know when - even though badhiyo before.
"
21296,"Throughout the day, the struggle of the folly and country-lover continued.

"
21300,"Such a lot of cuts were played on me that it was like all my body washed in the blood.
"
21301,"Stretch the little body into a compound shop.
"
21302,"Even though my body was stirred up, selfless was living.
"
21303,"C . R . P . The Officer of the hurry - hurry up and shouting a white paper in front of my bloody face ... right ... said.

21308,"Then what happened to me , .. I do not know what's up.
"
21309,"How do I live ?
"
21310,"Imagine that people do not die as a result.
"
21311,"I went back to life and returned again to Sikkim's mother with life, but the eyes of Sikkim and the Indian government were overwhelmed with me.
"
21312,"It was kept overseas on me - 1974 itself ended.
"
21313,"In 1 9 75 surudakhi thinking or speaking so much to understand, speak , famous for diarrhea - urine is allowed to live in the situation that arose.

"
21315,"The body was not known to go out for treatment.
"
21316,"The body was to be thrown out on the ground.
"
21317,"The coincidence of Sikkim's public and Sikkim's mother became my living motivation.

21318,"Taking care of me and keeping the head of those who are coincidental, I am worried . 26 - 4 - 1 9 75 In what resolution of the Sikkim leaders ?
"
21319,"She was the grave of our future child , that paper was held , leaders were mothers of mothers.
"
21320,"Do not tell who is the ' Earth ours ' ?
"
21321,"So . From 26 - 4 - 75 to 16 - 5 - 75, how did Sikkim leaders tackle alcohol in Rajbbas and how much money was spent and the future of future generations ?
"
21322,"Even when I remembered, it seems complicated that I have been born in Sikkim.
"
21323,""" Sikkim for the future - this one would not understand this.

"
21537,"It is not awakened and organized , but it is not completely destroyed in the dark.
"
21538,"Organizations have also made arrangements for the organization's needs as they are unable to do anything alone.
"
21539,"The name of this loving organization has kept the ' All Nepal Women's Association ' .
"
21540,"Through this organization, the kind of consciousness is giving thanks.

"
21544,"Our country is full of village villages.
"
21545,"There are only 40 cities in our country with 40 thousand villages.
"
21546,"In some of our 75 districts of our country, motorcycles have not been able to reach the motor.
"
21547,"Illustration , poverty and exploitation is like our air is ""like water and dust "" .
"
21548,"Industry has not developed growth.
"
21549,"About 90% of the total population of the country has come to farming.
"
21550,"The remaining 10 percent of industry only trade and work.
"
21551,"Since the farmer's income is very low, 60 percent of farmers do not have to eat for the year.
"
21552,"So the city of Nepal and India kept the big city , cook , rinse , soldier , nurse who work there are very.
"
21553,"Due to education, consciousness has not been developed.
"
21554,"Without consciousness of consciousness, it can not be known about its right and duty.
"
21555,"Therefore, Nepalese society is backward.
"
21556,"Nepal is also the poorest in the 4 countries.
"
21557,"Due to this, the lack of desire for many rural rural women is limited due to impartiality and poverty still covering the Nepali society.
"

21559,"But do not want to have such normal wishes.
"

"
21567,"Thus the child's fine dried mug and sweet food always fits.
"
21568,"Whatever sacred nonsense remains, women in the house should always be dumped from exploitative and fake cracks.
"
21569,"The situation of a couple of unmarried couples is still sad.
"
21570,"There is no place for pain in the heart.
"
21571,"The pain does not even hurt if there is pain.

"
21576,"Nepali women have suffered a lot.
"
21577,"There is a problem with countless difficulties.
"
21578,"But this situation can not be sustained.
"
21579,"Now it has begun to burn consciousness to destroy the darkness.

"
21581,"How can women get rights , right ?
"
21582,"Women or men should be aware of any kind of rights.
"
21583,"If there is no country free, it is certain that the people of the country are not free.
"

"
21585,"Our country's feudal regime , brokers - bureaucratic capitalism and imperialism, the exploiting class good hands.
"
21586,"The government that does good to such exploitative class does not like public and women too.
"

"
21592,"What can I do to jabble ?
"
21593,"What is my capacity ?
"
21594,"Such an idea is a bad idea.
"
21595,"We should never be self-sufficient.
"
21596,"Self-arrest can also endure the stress of others and stop getting rid of pressure.
"
21597,"To remove such weaknesses, women should try to learn a new new curse.
"
21598,"As home - Protect exceeds other productive work.
"
21599,"You should try to learn what you do not know.
"
21600,"After tears, the field drops off.
"
21601,"Many years ago, people did not even know how to dress.
"
21602,"Did not even know how to build a house. We did not even know about farming.
"
21603,"But going on learn everything now.
"
21604,"When making a motor , radio , television , computer too.
"
21605,"If it was not known, it would have been wild, but due to the tears, the distance left behind.
"
21606,"So we know the beginning of all things , can not do , little by little we can do all things.
"
21607,"Women of socialist democratic countries have got many achievements happy and happy.
"
21608,"But they were very sorry to bring happiness and happiness.
"
21609,"The country was also an oppressor like the first in our country.
"
21610,"King Ross of Russia and Chin Kisak are criminals who are counted worldwide.
"
21611,"There was a great deal of suffering and hurders.
"
21612,"Nepalese women too are increasingly expanding this matter.
"
21613,"Many have not yet understood.
"
21614,"Someone has understood and worked hard.
"
21615,"But most of the people who understand as if they are stuck.
"
21616,"The ' All Nepal Women's Association ' has begun to love the loving flag as its most loved ones.
"
21617,"Being conscious and courageous, it has started working in the organization.
"
21618,"Even as weakened so far , the expansion is increasingly like the sun in the morning , like the moon of Shukl .
"
21619,"The oldest and the oldest, the oldest, and the oldest, are younger and weak, but this is not the same.
"
21620,"Now Nepal is the ruler of exploitors, so their fake ' slacked organization ' and power seem strong.
"
21621,"But because of the idea of ​​intentions and intentions it drops down one day.
"
21622,"Now we have become clear that women should be attained and organized in order to get the rights of rights.
"
21623,"Our movement should not be anti-male.
"
21624,"It is important to understand that this is a bad governance system for all types of exploitation.
"
21625,"It should be brought out by removing the republican rule and to do all the work , a publicist system of love for the public.
"
21626,"We must loose ourselves to bring that law.
"
21627,"In this way, we can get our right to the right.
"
21628,"Women who do not participate in the public movement do not do good for women
"
21629,"There was no class in the primitive condition of our society.
"
21630,"When the class is not class - struggle was not.
"
21631,"Time passed People go to farming.
"
21632,"Also to make weapons of weapons invented and tools.
"
21633,"Production increased.
"
21634,"Production increased after the production was increased.
"
21635,"The savings thing did not let go to play hunting and seek to find fruit.
"
21636,"After that, many people were lazy.
"
21637,"The lazy man learned the idea of ​​cheating more.
"
21638,"After that, the spirit of others worked with intelligence and the feeling of resting on them went awake.
"
21639,"The lazy man got a fight for the things he got.
"
21640,"Since hand weapons and other means were also subject to them, some direct workers could attract themselves to flames.
"
21641,"So he started using a hack with a few people who knew nothing about it.
"
21642,"All rights reserved.
"
21643,"It has become the master to take this right.
"
21644,"Become a slave to work under it.
"
21645,"There was no right in the hands of slaves.
"
21646,"After this the slave's rights came to an end all the rights of women.
"
21647,"The older primitive society had more rights to women than men.
"
21648,"There is no right but intelligence - discretion too.
"
21649,"After the slave age, the rights owner went to the hands of the class.
"
21650,"The women became respectless as slaves respectively.
"
21651,"Later, the result of the struggle throughout Dussiyev was some improvement in Dasiyug and the feudal system was implemented.
"
21652,"Women's rights were also lost in this era.
"
21653,"Women should not , should not laugh , women can be beaten , women are empowered to use it over the floor began to be used.
"
21654,"After the death of the dead, they started to kill the dead body with the dead body.
"
21655,"Women were reminded of stepmother.
"
21656,"There is only farmer in the single feudal era, all labor women also have to live as slaves.
"
21657,"After the feudal era, capitalism emerged.
"
21658,"Although there was some freedom to women in the capitalist era, severe exploitation continued to remain.
"
21659,"The capitalist shakas started to buy women as money and can be sold as a molecule.
"
21660,"Berg - Conflict
"
21661,"There are many types of classes in each society.
"
21662,"These barges combine themselves with different selfishness among themselves.
"
21663,"As a result society class - struggle delicate and pathetic situation is generated.
"
21664,"Each Berg has his fixed , social status.
"
21665,"Based on which social reputation of that class is maintained.
"
21666,"Apart from this, the high class instrument source is complete, the following is the instrument of equipment.
"
21667,"There is a direct or indirect struggle between these two.
"
21668,"Thus, if we see , social conflicts are being strengthened by mutual conflicts , fears , or struggles between class - class .
"
21669,"Scientists have described the causes of the class - struggles.
"
21670,"In this context , the sociological scholar named "" Anonymous Barber "" - has said the two main reasons for the conflict.
"
21671,"1 ) moral differences
"
21672,"Barabarale not moral - the difference between the class - struggle, said the main reason.
"
21673,"The moral values ​​and ideals of each class will be favorable to their own class.
"
21674,"High classes are favorable for ethical values ​​and ideals that do not contrary to their interests.
"
21675,"But the following classes are compelled to follow these values ​​and values ​​as this simulation can not be profitable in their interest.
"
21676,"Therefore, the following class , upper class appear on against or against.
"
21677,"As a result, Berg - Stopping the struggle - stops moving.
"
21678,"2 ) Cultural differences
"
21679,"And in the past cultural conflict also leads to conflict.
"
21680,"Different cultural groups when in contact with one another due to cultural differences have come to the class - struggle wants to - wants can also not be prevented.
"
21681,"3 ) Religious differences
"
21682,"In the society people of different ideas and communities live.
"
21683,"Through their own - their own religious persuasion - a difference and thoughts are.
"
21684,"The religions of a religion have sought to dominate the religion of another religion, which is why the struggle becomes inevitable.
"
21685,"It is a fascinating example of Hindu - Muslim controversy in Nepal , Sinhalese radicalists , Ayodhya Babri - mosque disputes etc.
"
21686,"History is witnessed in such a destructive event that even thousands of innocent people died in the famine.
"
21687,"Class struggle and form (Forms of Class Conflict)
"
21688,"Due to the viewpoint of expression, there are many forms of class struggle.
"
21689,"In the economic sphere or religious areas , not only in cultural areas, cultural differences also struggle together.
"
21690,"Their ethnic groups, together for racial differences, have struggled primarily in the following situations : -
"
21691,"A ) economic struggle
"
21692,"One of two different cultures - different economic conflict between the interest of keeping goes.
"
21693,"This struggle is based on the production level.
"
21694,"Continuous production, which reaches the power of the source or class, exploits powerless or otherwise.
"
21695,"B ) Religious conflict
"
21696,"The conflict between two mutually oppressed religions is a religious struggle.
"

22002,"But you also need to be careful.
"
22003,"Your two three mistakes will be forgiven, but it can not be said that all of the mistakes may be forgiven as Mitti's house.
"
22004,"Its point is that you were very bad at home in Mitti.

"
22046,"Because the food can not be made for a person.
"
22047,"Always cook food to other family members when you make food according to your will.
"
22048,"Likewise, you do not like cooking food according to the members of the family members.
"
22049,"So try to equate it.
"
22050,"The other thing is that some housewives consume husbands , brothers, or daughters, and keep them alone.
"
22051,"What else do you talk about others? It does not give you a share of sweet dishes.
"
22052,"This is a very bad trend.

"
22113,"And most of them were delighted to have their mental balance fine.
"
22114,"There was nothing special.
"
22115,"When trying to joke with the police, Norman himself was a victim of joke and his silly stubbornness was only to become a mile.
"
22116,"The event is like this -
"
22117,"New York , June 9 , 1960.
"

22120,"When he was careful - even while Norman reached a place.
"
22121,"Also with the police !
"
22122,"He was called to the police car by caring for a car rental.
"
22123,"The police looked back at Normon and turned back.
"
22124,"However , Norman was just saying ' taxi - taxi ' .
"
22125,"The police started driving the car and brought him in front of him.
"
22126,"One policeman stopped the car , "" What , sir !
"
22127,"Do you think this car is a taxi ? ""
"
22128,""" Yes , I feel like a taxi. ""
"
22129,"Norman slowly shouted.
"
22130,""" The way it is tataumchu , but , before you hot from me. ""
"
22131,"Norman said to be fighting.
"

"
22138,"In the same way, the police took him into a cabin and he was hanged.
"
22139,"On that day Adle went to Thana and delivered him to bail.
"
22140,"Shortly after this , Norman Meler was ready to prepare for the work on July 23.
"
22141,"First of all, he listened to ' possible questions ' that could be asked from the police and he wrote the answers to his response.
"
22142,"Some of the examples of their questions were such , - ' Do you know - do the Norwegian comparisons compare the Nazi ?
"
22143,"... ' Do you often see the incident of violence in the dream ? '
"
22144,"... How much did you start telling the truth and the truth ?

"
22147,"However , he was at that time with great amazement , when majistretale opportunity to ask him such questions ruled supply without dissent.
"
22148,"However , you are not guilty of misuse of the police.
"
22149,"And , I suggest you , build good habits for the police on the other hand. '
"
22150,"Thus the court proceeded.
"
22151,"However , the New Yorkians did not forget this incident for a long time.
"
22152,""" Meyarapadakalagi Norman hunasaklana and reliable person ?
"
22153,"... is their mental balance right ? '
"
22154,"These questions started listening to hotels - restaurants , offices.

"
22156,"Meanwhile , the election jitnakanimti Norman Mailer were working very seriously.
"
22157,"But , there was lack of practical knowledge.
"
22158,"At the same time, he was still unmarried in this work.
"
22159,"He appointed the poet Jinsworg , author terminal and journalist Seer Cream as the post of his press secretary.
"
22160,"What was the matter of the fun , all those duration of election campaign , together with those three, published only one press release.
"
22161,"Norman himself himself prepared the summary of the release.
"
22162,"There was a fraction of the release.
"
22163,"'.. Our new mayor will try to stop the crimes in teenage age.
"
22164,"There will be a need to mobilize the Nazi - war competition between the police to raise expenses for sleep ... '
"
22165,"Norman had a neighbor , a novelist.
"
22166,"His name was ' Humms ' .
"
22167,"Hughes overlined the Norman campaign's campaign very well and success was very much.
"
22168,"A few days later, Norman reduced the amount of alcohol and drug addiction and was actively aimed at dumping his election campaign vehicle.
"
22169,"His approach to election campaign was more romantic.
"
22170,"22 navemvara 1 9 60, he "" fiddles krayastrolai an open letter ' written dissemination were provided by most forthrightly.
"
22171,"America, like the leader of the United States, is suffering from selfless liberty due to oppression and corruption prevailing in the government system.
"
22172,"You have a humble request that you get rid of Communist's shields , otherwise the US government does not have enough time to go on this excuse. ""
"
22173,"Of course , a prophecy was written in the statement of Norman.
"
22174,"That , after the term of President Kennedy, "" he pimsa of ' above was realized as an attack on one US.
"
22175,"However , his election campaigns of the concerns that were trapped , Arrest knew.
"
22176,"However , despite the fact that he wrote that open letter, his influence was reversed in the election campaign.
"
22177,"Because , nyuyorkavasi kryastroko's name who did the hate.
"
22178,"Therefore , the openings of the Mayor Candidate Norman Norman were more aggravated than attracting the New Yorkians to her.
"
22179,"' Which of the categories and areas you are hoping for in the New York City, are you hoping to get support ? '
"
22180,"Reason , I've been before making their voice. '
"
22181,"Only by their support can you win the election ? '
"
22182,"Earlier , on 19th November, 1960 , Norman Melar organized an informal meal to declare Mayor candidate's candidacy.
"
22183,"On the feast , all the remarkable , influential and exclusive people in New York were invited.
"
22184,"Among them , he was invited to the ban for the New York Police Commissioner - Commissar , Fingering - Commissioner, all department directors , artists , writers and journalists , President of the UN Department of Defense.
"
22185,"It was his purpose , voters showed that his grand influence and supremacy.
"
22186,"Unlike his aspiration , his specialty was not included in the banquet , except a couple of less important figures.
"
22187,"By calling out by his colleagues , committing a banquet ceremony, he tried to apologize and fulfill his betrayal.
"
22188,"Still no tips.
"
22189,"Norman suffered a lot from it.

"
22193,"Pictures , he was detained by police, they shared territory.
"
22194,"The atmosphere of the Norman Auxiliary feast was bitter and became more stressful.
"
22195,"By the way , Norman said , ' Who's there , want to play with me ? '
"
22196,"He started crying.
"
22197,"One of the guests - two accepting their challenge.
"
22198,"Now it's too late.

"
22209,"I do not speak.
"
22210,"But think , it was difficult to try to get them back.
"
22211,"After a while, he got up and fell.

22218,"Donogo has also kept a repair.
"
22219,"In the same revenge, he is struggling with his guests.
"
22220,"Blood was flowing through her nose.
"
22221,"' It was four in the morning and all the guests had departed.
"
22222,"Norman entered his kitchen.
"
22223,"Seeing her frustrated appearance , Mrs. Edley said , "" O God , what happened ?
"
22224,"How did you drive it out ?
"
22225,"What are you all alone to do with Bhakkumar ? ""
"
22226,"Norman did so quickly to do so that he did not even think that he would do this.
"
22227,"Otherwise , we must try to stop them.
"
22228,"By all, Mrs. Adley immediately slept in a draft and brought home to neighboring Homs.
"
22229,"Norman was kept away from him , because Norman's furious look had a full sense of his disposition.
"
22230,"We all did a very important caution to let Mrs Adele not stir up.
"
22231,"' Mrs. Edle could not speak , she was apparently depressed by her face being depressed .
"
22232,"In unconscious condition she repeatedly repeats the same sentence "" How did this happen ? ""
"
22233,"... I can not believe !
"
22234,"... the decent people like us too ! ? '
"
22235,"The scene of the scene was calm , the atmosphere was shocked. '
"
22236,"This is the case of Norman's neighbors.
"
22237,"Hums made a drunk . Call the Rosen Berg.
"
22238,"The doctor and the police incident report no more reasonably - reduced without immediately tell it was decided.
"
22239,"A little, Dr . Rogenberg arrived at the scene and Smt. Adele inquiry immediately told the ambulance.
"
22240,"She stopped and replied.
"
22241,"He did not want to tell the exact reason for the incident to save Norman.
"
22242,"Stabbing a wound , which was planted in pithyuma , Hearts chunabata was a little bit saved. '
"
22243,"There was no basis to believe in the report of Mrs. Adela from the medical report and the nature of the wound.
"
22244,"Hence , information was given to the police.
"
22245,"After Mrs. Edlely took over the hospital, she went to her home to understand the condition of Hughes Norman.
"
22246,"Norman was confused in disturbance.
"
22247,"He is - what is the situation - what happened ?
"
22248,"It seemed like he did not know.
"
22249,"Hughes brought the old couple's daughter-in-law's daughter-in-law to bring her home to her home.
"
22250,"After that , he reported the incident by calling sister of Nirman's sister Barbara and her husband.
"
22251,"During the phone conversation, he also urged the girl's daughter to take her home.
"
22252,"Shortly after Barbara and her husband arrived.
"
22253,"And , immediately to visit Mrs. Adela, visit the hospital.
"
22254,"Until then Narman had also gone intoxicated , he also went to the hospital with them.
"
22255,"During the hospital, Mrs. Adele's operation has begun.
"
22256,"In the evening, three o'clock was canceled , and Mrs. Edlely said , "" Do not answer the police if you ask something !""
"
22257,"She went out of the hospital sometime.
"
22258,"7 . The way
"
22259,"Today the world has been growing.
"
22260,"To get rid of that repentance, we must work very hard , move forward in our own boldness and tear.
"
22261,"The pathway plays an ego role to make the most of our labor and labor hard work.
"
22262,"The development of the development works and the way the people benefit from them is the most effective way.
"
22263,"7 . 1 . 1 - pedestrian road
"
22264,"Because of 83 % of the Nepalese dominant states, due to mountainous and mountainous areas, its geographical deterrence is not unusual.
"
22265,"For this reason, there is no alternative except for walking from most Nepalis and from one place to another.
"
22266,"So here is the "" Commissioning Communion No Illegal "" .
"
22267,"Would such a thinking develop Nepal as we like ?
"
22268,"Never at all
"
22269,"7 . 1 . 2 - horse riding
"
22270,"Most of the hilly and mountainous terrain, not only in the Terai region of vicissitudes, including the movement - of movement enabled to walk the way of the main base.
"
22271,"A little progressive way of hiking is horse ( horses , mules , donkeys etc. ) can be a pathway.
"
22272,"Life is very painful here.
"
22273,"The use of daily use goods and development works is a man and mules, to make arrangements for managing and maintenance.
"
22274,"On the one hand, this process becomes expensive, and how sad it is to the other.
"
22275,"The government has the first obligation to save people from such a situation.
"
22276,"As far as the means of transporting pets, as far as possible , the people of the Himalayas appear in the frontline.
"
22277,"Therefore, the pedestrian route is a reliable option , which is very shortly present in the title of this title.
"
22278,"7 . 1 . 3 - motor road
"
22279,"Kochi - Kathmandu Highway , Kathmandu - Pokhara Highway and Pokhara Baghlung Highway have been working to connect some areas of the hilly mountainous regions of Nepal.
"
22280,"Why should not this type of technology be used ?
"
22281,"This technique is very good for the country like Nepal and it is also important to play an important role in protecting the environment.
"
22282,"Due to this, the area of ​​municipality and market where the market will be clean and clean.
"
22283,"7 . 1 . 4 - Hawaii Road ( Airport )
"
22284,"Even if there is some high-cost road route, air traffic is a convenient tool.
"
22285,"It has served its various places in Nepal.
"
22286,"Come to blame - the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation ended the inning going to be operating as a competitive air service operations should be laid new power.
"
22287,"7 . 1 . 4 . 1 - Whether our air service corporation or private level was required.
"
22288,"7 . 1 . 4 . 2 . 1 - Railroad ( Railroad )
"
22289,"The cheapest means of transportation is the railway sector , but it is very good to have a co-ordinance for railways.
"
22290,"Rail traffic can be expanded in the Terai portion of the area covering 17 % of the parts in Nepal and 83 % of the area is not possible if it is possible.
"
22291,"Almost 17 % of the land should be in the long run , to make a railway plan , which will run by electricity.
"
22292,"In that case, environment is not polluted on one side and the use of power generation in the country does not have to face the face of foreigners.
"

"
23669,"The people and the people who fled to flee began to escape from there.
"
23670,"But it is also about standing 100 - 150 more tyahinnai parcel.
"
23671,"At the same time, the procession increased from the path towards Kamal Pokhari and came to the house of Mahendra.
"
23672,"Some of them tried to keep the black flag on the grate.
"
23673,"In this time, the police on the way from the World Heritage Cinema Hall started shooting these youngsters.
"
23674,"After one, five people were shot dead, one of them had a decked waist and another one had a blue-half wow kitchens.
"
23675,"Later, after seeing them at the hospital, I was exposed to the boy's boyfriend, and a half-wow waist in the boy's room.
"
23676,"The fire was shooting from Bishyajyoti.
"
23677,"In that process, there were some young men in the Kamaladdi.
"
23678,"One of them was a nurse.
"
23679,"When she asked for a visit to take Las and injured, two other young women were ready and three of them went forward to the year of Mahendra.
"
23680,"But not reaching at some, the youngsters on both sides of the nurse were shot dead.
"
23681,"But the police took a shot and got the young man and he fell there.
"
23682,"The police were pushing Julus, unable to raise it.
"
23683,"A few parts of the procession came from the Haiti district office.
"
23684,"However, the police shot at that junus from the corner of the bridges constructed recently.
"
23685,"When I shot there, a man working on the state intelligence establishment told me that the incident took place in the Panch Library.
"
23686,"He said that there were 10 people who were shot dead.
"
23687,"He later said that he had been put in large ammunition after he wrote.
"
23688,"At that same time, a person called on the Bir Hospital, called on the phone of Tri - Chandra College, and also called ambulance there.
"
23689,"Here one thing can be doubted if the bullets were shifted, the ambulance of police and military hospital was pre-prepared to be fired.
"
23690,"Then the police themselves started stirring stones in a volatile manner.
"
23691,"The strangers showed that the Nepal Television in the morning on April 24 showed the worst incident in that area.
"
23692,"They have since signed by the Annapurna Hotel and bisvajyoti loving fans of cinema and the way Kamaladi 3 - 4 houses were shattered glass damage.
"
23693,"After that, when the police gathered a bungalow housing office, some policemen gathered in the Tempo Park of the District Office and RanipokakhirinGichi.
"
23694,"There were more than 500 people gathered together at the same time.
"
23695,"At the time of the slogans they started to be slogans, the Kamaladhi was shot.
"
23696,"But the soldiers inside there fired them compound.
"
23697,"The police murdered the same youths in the same way.
"
23698,"There was a number of 8 men and 8 to 10 years of age.
"
23699,"Later, the zombies were taken by military vehicles.
"
23700,"The same thing was confirmed by Dilip Bhatt of Vaska Doti with a shelter in the house of the locals.
"
23701,"The shooter started distributing the 500-odd procession again and hid inside the Tri - Chandra Bhavan campus.
"
23702,"This pillar was removed from the Tandhara school.
"
23703,"Then the Judus returned and began to stone stones on the policemen lying in Jumble.
"
23704,"A young man, who was participating in the procession, touched the police and stuck at the mouth and got abused.
"
23705,"At the same time, the police brought the people who were shot dead and took them in their ambulance.
"
23706,"At the same time, two young men brought another shot man.
"
23707,"But the police on the jumble took the young man into his ambulance with a petty shot.
"
23708,"When Jumachok was beaten by a police force, the division was divided into two parts, and one court went to the road from Bhattahihati towards the school and another Kamalachhi went to Asan.
"
23709,"After the police began to stone stones on Judus, who was on the way to school, and Darwar, Julus started doing a counterfeit stone.
"
23710,"The police demanded further assistance after Judus then demolished the police booth in Nepal Bank.
"
23711,"More policemen came in their first kamalachitira julusamathi 10 - 12 began to throw tear gas.
"
23712,"Similarly, the palace skulatira 6 - 7 gyansa phyakyo six tier.
"
23713,"Judas of the Darbar School, camping on the Tire Gaisins, camped in Rinpokhari.

23714,"The type of action of the police threatened to shoot a pillar after the procession was not calm and immediately it began to shoot.
"
23715,"The eyewitness said that the police were shot dead in a volatile manner and 8 were injured.
"
23716,"It is important to remember here that there is a difference in the way to the radar and hereby the way it is shot.
"
23717,"The bullets on the radar road were skilled if the bulleters here are not skilled.
"
23718,"Eighth scheme basis
"
23719,"Introduction
"
23720,"1 . Eighth scheme v . NO . The democratic government formed after the political change of 2046 is the first plan.
"
23721,"The perspective on this plan is based on two major contradictory facts in this perspective.
"
23722,"Due to lack of natural resources and natural environment, the challenge has made this challenge even more complicated.
"
23723,"In this situation , natural discipline , futility and financial sacrifice are needed.
"
23724,"The present availability and current reference
"
23725,"3 . Due to the evaluation of the major economic and physical index of the past three decades, the Panchayat system appears to be a frustrating situation.
"
23726,"There was no change in the life of the masses.
"
23727,"Some of the financial conditions went down shortly.
"
23728,"In the said period, the actual increase in health production remained 3% , as per the percentage of per capita income only . Only 8 percent.
"
23729,"Quantitative view 2021. Rs 022 on per capita income . 1303 was 2046. 47 at Rs . Only 1597 remained.
"
23730,"2031 in the last 26 years. 032 to constant price only Rs . It seems to be just 295.
"
23731,"As a result, Nepal has been standing in the line of ten poor countries of the world.
"
23732,"5 . Due to the low economic growth rate and increasing economic and capital disparity, the majority of people are pushing under the poverty line.
"
23733,"Approximately 80 to 90 million people are estimated to be below poverty line.
"
23734,"Such a large number of people are deprived of the basic necessity of life.
"
23735,"Due to lack of population growth rate, food supply supply has also affected the availability of food grains.
"
23736,"6 . About 60 percent of the total gross production of agriculture has been traded and the basis for production is also traditional.
"
23737,"More than 90 percent of labor force is always dependent on life.
"
23738,"This kind of involvement in labor force in agriculture is the highest in the world.
"
23739,"While the production of labor in labor is already low, more dependence on agriculture for increasing labor force, the production of labor in agriculture is decreasing.
"
23740,"Labor force has been estimated to be two in 20 years.
"
23741,"In that case 8000 weeks will be increased for labor force.
"
23742,"Due to lack of farm land remaining to be utilized, these new workers should be given employment in non agriculture fields.
"
23743,"7 . Because of the labor force dependent on agriculture, it should be more complicated due to excessive weather conditions.
"
23744,"The adverse weather affects farmers' income by reducing agricultural production.
"
23745,"Which also increases the value of food items.
"
23746,"Come . And . 2021. 22 come from . And . 2046. By 47 years of total food production . 3% has increased.
"
23747,"This growth has been mainly due to the expansion of agriculture sector than the growth of productivity or agricultural material.
"
23748,"During this period, hector productivity has become steady or depressive.
"
23749,"In this period, the efforts of agriculture sector inadequate to maintain uncertainty of total food production were inadequate.
"
23750,"8 . Nepal's industrial sector has not affected the country's economy.
"
23751,"Despite the promotion of industrial sector in the past, this area is in the initial state.
"
23752,"There has been a decrease in profits and investments by utilizing capacity in the industry , value added .
"
23753,"No sub-region under this area has still been able to attract indigenous or foreign investors.
"
23754,"9 . Special investment in private sector has attracted more land than in the field of production and trade.
"
23755,"Industrialized area is mainly owned by government.
"
23756,"Industrial investment is very limited.
"
23757,"Capital market is very small and weaker.
"
23758,"Most private sector private enterprises have not been able to develop capital markets due to lack of operating.
"
23759,"10 . The service sector (Service Sector) has the least progress has been able to.
"
23760,"Total national production come . And . 2021. The contribution of this sector is 22 percent more than 22 . And . 2046. 47 has reached 24 percent.
"
23761,"The service sector's contribution to total gross domestic production only in fewer countries of the world will be reduced.
"
23762,"11 . Due to discrepancies of economic policies of the past years, development revenues have been uniformly distributed.
"
23763,"Especially common in rural areas and the city - inequality has increased.
"
23764,"Rural areas have only limited access to modernization.
"
23765,"Poverty has increased in the rural areas.
"
23766,"Rural areas have been deprived of drinking water , health facilities and transportation facilities like vital amenities of life .
"
23767,"The gulf between the city and the city is increasing.
"
23768,"To avoid poverty, people are moving from rural areas towards the city.
"
23769,"Untapped arts have been shown in cities like Kathmandu , Biratnagar and Pokharka.
"
23770,"The economic disparity among the five development sectors is increasing with the Himalayas , the mountains and the Terai region.
"
23771,"The main reason for this is the lack of inequality and natural resources in infrastructure development.
"
23772,"12 . As per the viewpoint of development based on the development of urban areas, financial disparities have arisen between different regions.
"
23773,"Also it has weakened the economy.
"
23774,"Environmental pollution has increased and the possibility of natural development based on nature has decreased.
"
23775,"Impact of population programs in rural areas is negligible.
"
23776,"Due to population growth, environmental balance is eradicated with the depreciation of natural heritage.
"
23777,"Due to the increase in increasing population due to the sustainability of rural areas, people are entering cities from rural areas in search of a happy future.
"
23778,"13 . Especially in the 1980s, the investment remained very high due to lack of level of investment.
"
23779,"More than half of the external resources were disbursed in the construction of capital.
"
23780,"The internal savings rate remained the lowest in the world.
"
23781,"During this period, national savings totaled less than 10 percent of the global production.
"
23782,"In many years it has been found between 7 to 8 percent.
"
23783,"Because of the low level national savings dependent on the external source for investment.
"
23784,"14 . Monetary liquidity and inflation inflation is excessive and over this period.
"
23785,"The mainstream increase in indirectly increased by international debt expansion from government sector.
"
23786,"The increase in foreign property also helped to increase the currency.
"
23787,"Due to uncontrolled expenditure in the government sector and inadequate revenue operations, the situation was made to meet budget deficit from the waking area.
"
23788,"Nepal has not only made inflation due to the currency exchange but it has also helped increase the demand of excess liquidity in increasing the demand of capital in the economy.
"
23789,"15 . In this period on budget, financial and financial expenditures have been adopted especially in internal and external expenditure and interest.
"
23790,"Real expenses come . And . 2031. 32 to 2046. During the period 47, the growth rate has increased by 19 percent.
"
23791,"Expenditure level 2031 on the basis of total health production. In the period of 32, about 9 percent was 2047. 48 has reached 22 percent in the period.
"
23792,"The total increase in this period was 13%.
"
23793,"On the other hand , during this period, revenue rose from 6 percent to 10 percent of total gross production . Has reached 5 percent.
"
23794,"As a result, the difference between revenue and expenditure has increased from 3 to 12 percent.
"
23795,"Due to this, arc of foreign and foreign debt is increasing in Nepal.
"
23796,"16 . Due to the limitation of the government's revenue operations, Government spending has to be dependent on debt.
"
23797,"In consequence the payment obligation of the payday loan is increasing.
"
23798,"The obligation of liquid payment is higher than the total revenue generation rate.
"
23799,"This growth rate is 2031. 32 in 5 percent and 2046. 47 24 . Has reached 5 percent.
"
23800,"Come . And . 2048. 4 9 This 30 . It is likely to reach 2 percent.
"
23801,"17 . Trade and payment balance status was also not good during this period.
"
23802,"2031. 32 to 2046. Trade deficit increased by 15 times during the period of 47.
"
23803,"The current account savings have dropped by 65 times.
"
23804,"It is the main reason for the exports not only to increase exports but also the increase in exports.
"
23805,"Despite so much, in savings across the entire state of affairs, originally due to the arrival of official and unofficial capital.
"
23806,"Increased foreign assistance and diverse capital as a program support in the last year of this review period have provided business deficit.
"
23807,"Due to this, foreign exchange reserves are generally satisfactory during that period.
"
23808,"18 . Although looking at the index of physical targets of different economic sectors, some of the products have been achieved, however, there has not been a satisfactory progress in the agriculture sector.
"
23809,"In this period the productivity has either been either diminished or stable.
"
23810,"The productivity of the industry is also decreasing.
"
23811,"Looking at the infrastructure development, there seems to be some progress in the road , communication , energy.
"
23812,"There has been some extension in the service of social sector education , health and drinking water.
"
23813,"Percentage income is only US $ 170 and around half the population is under absolute poverty.
"
23814,"Although there is some progress in the field of social and infrastructure development, there is no change in production structure, there is a major disadvantage for rapid development.
"
23815,"Its additional expansion policy and monetary liquidity and inflation of inflation have increased significantly.
"
23816,"Due to this, Nepali has been facing difficulty for normal life.
"
23817,"20 . Among the other reasons for the economic development block, among the various reasons for the uneven policies and the development of the economic and monetary sector is the main development.
"
23818,"These are especially seen in the following : -
"
23819,"( A ) excessive control and interference : in the past years, the government-controlled development process has created great difficulties.
"
23820,"The delay in decision-making and budget implementation has not increased due to the cost of project implementation and has not fully utilized the administrative capacity.
"
23821,"( B ) Disabled Government Institutes : Governmental institutions have become more disadvantaged , depressed, and destructive.
"
23822,"Nepali institutions have not been able to mobilize and improve due to these institutions receiving monopoly in different areas.
"
23823,"The financial obligation of these institutions has become so big that it will have a huge difficulty to reduce the liability in the near future.
"
23824,"More than necessary staff recruitment , lack of political interference , ineligible and liability etc. are their immediate-time problems.
"
23825,"( C ) Unprofitable investment : More than one thousand projects are being operated in Nepal.
"
23826,"Due to integration of different fields and sub-fields, they did not invest properly in these areas and sub-regions.
"
23827,"Some projects are not fairly economical and socially visible.
"
23828,"Due to the increase in time and cost these projects are not currently rational.
"
23829,"The benefits derived from these projects seem less than a fraction of the loss.
"
23830,"Investments on such projects are to be stopped.
"
23831,"( D ) Dangerous Economy : Due to geographical deterrence production and distribution have become expensive.
"
23832,"Projects have become expensive for the lack of coordination in the project preparation and lack of integrated programs.
"
23833,"( E ) Disabled administration : This has led to the reduction in capacity building of the Government of Sri Lanka's development programs effectively and efficiently.
"
23834,"The civil service is large and its maximum is not used and it is not functional.
"
23835,"This is the main reason for financial problems.
"
23836,"There are some major reasons for traditionally based administrative and economic structure , more centralization of rights and lack of insufficient rights in the local level.
"
23837,"( F ) Incorrect planning process : Planning process is not weaker and it is institutionalized only in small quantities.
"
23838,"The past plans were applied at local level and lacked democracy qualities.
"
23839,"The projects were imposed on a wall which had no economic and social basis.
"
23840,"The stupid medicine used to come into the process of planning.
"
23841,"Statement of General Secretariat of All Nepal Minorities Staff, Mahesheshman Khattune : -
"
23842,"Nepal has been a member of the National Empowerment Organization for the Adhikari Adhikari Committee from Kathmandu.
"
23843,"Mr. Mohan . C . Enjoy the opportunity to see your brother.
"
23844,"Also, in the democratic country like India, the employee is affiliated with us in the organization.
"
23845,"Nepalese national ministries are also indirectly seen from the appeal of the organization to accept the organization's methods from the democratic system of the democratic system.
"
23846,"Which will explain all the issues related to organization and conflict of Nepali national employees.
"
23847,"By learning with India or driven by the democracy of India, civil servants are not required to organize in Nepal.
"
23848,"This organization was based on the principle of pure proletariat.
"
23849,"Because self-realistic and low-interest interests are always interrupted.
"
23850,"High class employees are working and acting classes.
"
23851,"The working class is a division of punishment for working and prosecuting.
"
23852,"According to the proletariat's theory, the class of exploitation of high-class is a class that is less restricted.
"
23853,"This is the purpose of the All Nepal Minorities Employee Association.
"
23854,"The 2007 year was announced on the day of Srpschmi : -

"
23869,"The form has been distributed to write a written vote on all the minimal employees, not to ask whether the demand is to be completed or not to complete the demand after the demand is not complete.
"
23870,"In the beginning, there were only a total of thousands of employees across the country.
"
23871,"Thousands of minor workers were written in favor of strike.
"
23872,"Mohan Shamsher had been defeated by the Prime Minister.
"
23873,"Nepali Congress President Matrica Prasad Koirala was prime minister.
"
23874,"2008 year ago . I . The Leo ( armed revolt ) done.
"
23875,"Security law applies as per the crisis.
"
23876,"Nepali Congress President and Nepalese Prime Minister Matrica Prasad Koirala invited Bharateli Army to enter Nepal.
"
23877,"It is the first time in the Nepal Valley that the Barttali army, which has been created by foreign troops, is the first time.
"
23878,"Prime Minister Koirala also made a law of press control.
"
23879,"The people whom the people had called for black law.
"
23880,"Until the protection of this law, the action of the All Nepal Minorities Employees Association remained simple.
"
23881,"Security law has dropped in the age of 200 years.
"
23882,"Due to the ultimatum crossing the program, the strike program was prepared.
"
23883,"On the open ground of the three-day school, a lariar made a reversal platform and decided to proclaim the strike.
"
23884,"A letter from Home Secretary Chandra Bahadur Thapa came to me about 2 hrs of the day on June 9, 2009.
"
23885,"Which was notified to strike.
"
23886,"Thereafter no letter was received from the Home Secretary.
"
23887,"The government of then Nepali Congress did not agree on the issue of joint statement of the Home Secretary with the General Secretariat of the Minorities.
"
23888,"And the Government took steps to arrest the strike.
"
23889,"The joint statement did not stop the strike without broadcasting the radio.
"
23890,"So according to the program, the program was organized in the five storeys of the three storeys on the evening of the evening.
"
23891,"At that time the doorway route was not opened.
"
23892,"There was no way to go to the Academy's three-storey school and to the Academy.
"
23893,"The staff moved towards the chest under the umbrella to flee.
"
23894,"From the road to the south-clock home and the West Regional Court, the army came to a military throne and came to the same staff as a staff.
"
23895,"According to the program on stage, see all the friends sitting in the Orleans Defense Lead.
"
23896,"I alone remain in the forum.
"
23897,"In the scenic scene, there was a tremendous tone in the tomb.
"
23898,"Looking for Mike Fukur, the government's hosts of the government have given Mikak Chandeli to them.
"
23899,"What should I do now?
"
23900,"At one table, I climb on the table table.
"
23901,"Foil the coat , fade the levada stem.
"
23902,"Angels Almost
"
23903,"So far my eyes turned towards the workers who were back.

23905,"Cry back to them.

23906,""" You do not have to pay.

"
24037,"Jaswat is all affected in national life.
"
24038,"Due to financial crisis in the economically weaker sections, there is more impact on financial crisis, the lack of economic growth can be predicted due to adverse impact on the women's class.
"
24039,"The inspectors given in the women's social , economic situation underdeveloped schedule make it clear.
"
24040,"Come on . And . The seventh plan is the last year.
"
24041,"Various ministries have been reviewed based on worksheet programs conducted by the policies governed by Women Development.
"
24042,"2 . Women Development Policy and National Planning
"
24043,"The need for the development of women in the development of women should not be realized in the five periodic plans of Nepal itself.
"
24044,"The character of the welfare service was considered as a weak class for women ( as a vanifassiari.
"
24045,"It was the main reason why such a view was not accepted by the traditional contribution of women's economic production.
"
24046,"The basic necessity of the fulfillment program also took the view of participation of women in the development of a welfare approach.
"
24047,"Thus, there was little improvement in the implementation of the party despite the change in the policy view of the scheme.
"
24048,"Even though the sixth and seventh plan emphasized on increasing women's participation in national policy, it could not be reflected on regional policy and programs.
"
24049,"3 . Women Development Programs
"
24050,"Women's development policies and programs can be mainly divided into 2 parts :
"
24051,"( A ) regional policy programs to encourage increased participation activities.
"
24052,"( B ) "" special "" programs that provide service and convenience for women's participation in the participation .
"
24053,"In the field of activities, to encourage women to participate in various tasks and training programs, such policies like giving priority to women are displayed from the worksheet.
"
24054,"On the other hand, various ministries have also been emphasized on conducting special programs for women.
"
24055,"4 . Regional Policy Programs : In this regard, the main policies and programs adopted by various ministries have been given below for example :
"
24056,"Such program 1988. In the district, 27 districts have been operating in 27 districts.
"
24057,"This program will be Ward Health Committee and member of the Committee - the Secretary will be female health worker.
"
24058,"Such types of programs can be expected to help women get more women in health care as well as help rural women effectively bring healthcare.
"
24059,"( C ) Agriculture : 1 . Women agri-assistant number has been increased to 200.
"
24060,"2 . The policy has to be taken for 25 percent of the participation in the programs and programs of Talem Program.
"
24061,"Women forest working in forest areas have not given permanent recognition to Nike and herbal.
"
24062,"( E ) Industry and Employment : Although the women are given the priority in shepherd education programs under various schemes of the domestic industry, the definite Kota is not excluded.
"
24063,"( F ) Local Development : Women's Contents are found in Unified Rural Development Schemes.
"
24064,"Thus , there is a strategy to develop women's participation in different areas , even if not national policy, to give women priority priority in regional programs.
"
24065,"The lack of policy programs to encourage women's participation in important areas , such as forest , water , management , environment housing.
"
24066,"5 . Special programs for women
"
24067,"The program organized as "" Special "" program for women development from various bodies emphasizes the following aspects :
"
24068,"1 . Formal education 2 . Informal education 3 . Healthcare 4 . Shepherd Talim 5 . Earnings Program 6 . Community Development
"
24069,"There is no significant program for women for women , health , forest and agriculture ministries.
"
24070,"These programs are as a general government program and the community does not have the policy to interfere with the participation.
"
24071,"The main objective of the domestic industry project is to provide employment to female women under the Ministry of Industry under the Ministry of Industry, providing sheet-proof training.
"
24072,"In the first phase of the project, providing the sheets to women with low income was provided as a raw material , machine tool loan loan.
"
24073,"In the third phase, the total number of 1800 women in the income-related business in the five years, to provide loans through commerce vancers.
"
24074,"Although this program has specially emphasized on self-employed and income-related aspects, community development is also included in the program as entry point of program.
"
24075,"According to the study conducted by women development center in 1990 . Si . R . Davlu . The project has confirmed the fact that the project has helped to raise the income of rural families.
"
24076,"The following study also illustrates the following facts :
"
24077,"1 . 75 of the total female participants . 8 percent illiterate.
"
24078,"2 . Only 3 of female participants . Only 2 percent landless farmer and 9 2 . 5 percent small farmers.
"
24079,"3 . The increase in household income of the income generated by the project was increased, but the work was mainly spent on food items.
"
24080,"4 . Most of the participants were engaged in livestock work and cattle belonging to locals.
"
24081,"6 . Tips for effective development of women development programs :
"
24082,"The programs related to the programs presented are the difficulties and implementation measures that have been implemented.
"
24083,"The suggestions given in various fields are as follows :
"
24084,"2 . Health : The difficulties and suggestions of this area are included in the worksheet related to women health volunteer program.
"
24085,"In the workheet, it is mentioned in the worksheet that the women's location should be given prioritizing measures to remove these difficulties.
"
24086,"7 . Comment comments and comments from the program
"
24087,"The National Planning Commission and regional ministries have to pay special attention to it.
"
24088,"In addition, women development units established in the ministry should play an important role in the ministry level.
"
24089,"2 . Women should be adopted as a integral part of national development in all the programs as possible to operate various programs.
"
24090,"3 . It is very important for political development to bring resources and resources to women development.
"
24091,"Such political policy of women's political participation will have a positive impact.
"
24092,"With the means of women workers working in various parties , the measures should be taken to overcome the political interests of women for the economic , social development of women .
"
24093,"4 . The purpose of conducting special programs for women is not to keep women separate from the equitable economic development process, but to enable them to participate in development process.
"
24094,"Therefore, making such programs is appropriate for the development and coordination of other development programs.
"
24095,"By doing this, women can play an active role even after a walk-in-action project is under the project.
"
24096,"Inspection of complaints and propaganda
"
24097,"1 . Decision on promotion complaint
"
24098,"Manasseh also saw the decision-making committee's decline in the number of training periods.

24104,"1 . 1 In 1992, the total internal output was 5 . It is seen by 5 percent increase, and population growth rate 2 . 1% left.
"
24105,"Agricultural production has fallen in hilly areas compared to Terai.
"
24106,"2 . Policy Management and Industry Commerce Status :
"
24107,"2 . 1 Today , the economic freedom policy like liberal economies , competition , market-oriented economy has adopted many countries today.
"
24108,"Nepal has also been in this direction.
"
24109,"For the purpose of developing independent and competitive feelings, such policies are a pleasure for the private sector.
"
24110,"But by going to a policy or system from a policy or system it does not immediately affect it.
"
24111,"Therefore, caution should be adopted in its solution, but it does not have a concrete program of Mr. 5's government.
"
24112,"These policies all interested industry vanijyasamvandhi come - your business has opened up the way.
"
24113,"2 . 3 Before the present industrial policy was implemented, the Federation submitted its recommendation to the Government of Sri Lanka.
"
24114,"Some of the topics are friendly nature of this policy by the law , but the same level of trade and industry (Equal Footing) placed not practical.
"
24115,"The agreement has not been found in a single way if there is no clear mention of Deemed Export .
"
24116,"2 . To grow in the competitiveness of 4 industries, large quantity of goods is needed for additional products produced.
"
24117,"In this regard, it has become inevitable to increase extraction.
"
24118,"Our withdrawal with India has not been able to grow as expected, but the quantity has gradually increased.
"
24119,"If this situation persists, the trade deficit of our country seems to have been adversely affected.
"
24120,"Customs clearance directly to the borders of such a treaty of commerce protokalaanusara Genesis evidence - a letter will be issued.
"
24121,"Various suggestions have been made to the government of Mr. 5 in the work of employment in the special agility of the employer's council under the Federation.
"
24122,"Though the labor law has been implemented only in the past year, the rules for which there will be no draft prepared in the form of sleep, there is more environment in this area.
"
24123,"Seeing this, labor peace seems to be seen throughout this period.
"
24124,"2 . 6 The Government of Sri Lanka has given full change in the current account to the Nepalese currency in the currency exchange system according to the new monetary policy.
"
24125,"According to this arrangement implemented from March 20, the government of Sri 5 has also started doing all the transactions through the unified exchange rate.

"
24128,"For import, the number of objects placed in the bolbola is set up only 6.
"
24129,"Such economic policies and measures are positive but the implementation of proper monitoring and evaluation system is essential for the successful implementation of these policies.
"
24130,"For this, there is a need to make a major change in the functional practices of the administrative bodies and there is an impression that the government is moving towards this change.
"

"
24162,"Overview over journalism
"
24163,"The idea of ​​presenting with the publication of the magazine takes an important place.
"
24164,"Therefore, when our journalism level and sales delivery and regularity of imported printed mediums, we have the opportunity to accept our weaknesses.
"
24165,"In order to maintain quality level, the attached person is more likely to engage in it.
"
24166,"Looking at the environment that Nepalese journalists are now passing through, the lack of self-employed leaflet dignity has also become a subject.
"
24167,"By publishing news based on horror, the fulfillment of the tradition of killing people's rights has shown that the entire journalism sector has started to look at unbelief.
"
24168,"Because of confidentiality news is true , the fact is expressed in a publication called only.
"
24169,"The fact that in the development of journalism sector is also the problem of economic problems and distribution of other reasons, it is also occasional to mention here.
"
24170,"Of course, there is a possibility of economic and commercial shortage in semi-developed countries such as Nepal and in developing countries in the industrial sector.
"
24171,"Due to the lack of environment that can compete, some obstacles have emerged in the development of private sector journalism.
"
24172,"This area should be acknowledged that the media's trustworthiness , effectiveness, and its language as well as its beliefs is a strong part.
"
24173,"The responsibility of the press should not be so much to find out that it is generally more than other members.
"
24174,"Our press, which has taken such an important responsibility, has the need for national interest in establishing a system of protest and support based on the quality of every public.
"
24175,"In this perspective, it seems that this area's behavior is not able to improve its position in view of the common reader.
"
24176,"Not to clarify the business character in our journalism, the day has become a challenge on this profession.
"
24177,"Especially journalists committed to maintain business integrity have faced a major challenge to preserve the prestige and reputation of this profession in the present perspective.
"
24178,"To bring such a situation, the concerned parties respected each other.
"
24179,"The other side was to be respected.
"
24180,"Critique is criticized solely for criticism by criticizing policy not on personal basis, but also on the basis of policy, ordinary courtesy also goes against discrimination.
"
24181,"For the qualitative enhancement of the paper, the publication profession should be more important to the engagement of the skilled people.
"
24182,"This is why many papers are often busy as a person , ideology, and a field of mail.
"
24183,"Usually the newspapers published a number of newspapers on the basis of the number and distribution of the best selling almost zero when it looks to see what percent.
"
24184,"When studying for any other basis that affects the sales delivery of any paperlet, the efforts made by the publication sector depend on many things.
"
24185,"In other words, providing accurate information can be more profitable for providing information to get more information.
"
24186,"In this case, public confidence will be easier for publication and regularity of the paperwork to make the concept of writing in the common reader class.
"
24187,"From this, readers are in the position of thinking about our situation with the practices of present-day printed media based on self-reliance.
"
24188,"Therefore, it is felt that the endurance of all parties is necessary to end this situation.
"
24189,"The number of publications that has taken place for journalism has increased even more for the spread of healthy journalism in the country.
"
24190,"Indigenous - Indigenous rights awareness and appreciation for the World Declaration on inter-draft has been prepared and made some recommendations for Nepal's indigenous approach was required , and

"
24194,"Therefore Nepal will be Kathmandu, Kathmandu, Kathmandu . M . C . This seminar was conducted in direct arrangements and participation of local residents in the activation of unit committee.
"
24195,"Therefore operational objectives of this symposium were kept as follows :

24461,"These titles are Rs . 9 4 million 1 million ( the budget 6 . 1 9 per cent ) has been allocated was.
"
24462,"In addition to the additional withdrawal from the receipt of income . 87 million 37 million ( total budget expenditure 6 . 0 9 percent ) spending is estimated.
"
24463,"Due to the increase in the maintenance and advisory service, the expenditure on service , rent and maintenance charges has increased every year.
"
24464,"( C ) stuffing stuff
"
24465,"It seems to be enough to reduce costs on fuel and unnecessary items to work on the principles of charity.
"
24466,"( D ) financial assistance , donations and rewards
"
24467,"In addition to this, the additional money from Bhapari is Rs . 2 billion 33 million ( a total of 13 bajatako . 9 8 per cent ) spending is estimated.
"
24468,"The budget statement was told to provide a clear policy of which grants of which grants would be utilized only.
"
24469,"Accordingly, information could not be found in which area is implemented.
"
24470,"The purpose of which grants for the purpose of the obligation is provided is that there is no need to see the money spent on the same work.
"
24471,"Again, it was also seen that such a grant was used in the daily work of various institutions.
"
24472,"It should also be reviewed in the policy of conducting daily tasks by providing permanent grant to business-based institutions.
"
24473,"( E ) Good luck
"
24474,"( F ) capital expenditure
"
24475,"Rs . 4 billion 11 million 52 million ( total budget expenditure 28 . 72 per cent ) spending is estimated.
"
24476,"Due to the necessary help in preparing the physical infrastructure of the country through such capital expenditure, there is also a huge amount of assistance from friends and organizations.
"
24477,"5 . Budget Sub - headings changed to
"
24478,"The right to reduce the sub - title does not mean that it lies in the ministry.
"
24479,"6 . The budget amount did not arrange the fridge
"
24480,"But the following thing does not seem to match.
"
24481,"( B ) 2044 for Karnali Zone. Regarding 45, it is not justified that the arrangement according to the above mentioned above.
"
24482,"According to that , the budget of drinking water , construction , transportation , irrigation and irrigation will not be collected in the fund.
"
24483,"The use of a dress could be used for the punishment of the prisoners and the feeling of crime indicator could have been awakened.
"
24484,"In other countries, similar administrative obligations should also be taken in place of the jail because there is a tendency for hair loss before entering the prison.
"
24485,"In case of any correction or additional rules contained in the jail rules, the offender or the captive captives should have a sense of punishment or guilt in crime.
"
24486,"Honorable courts have a tradition to punish them.
"
24487,"Those who are punished are sent to the prison.
"
24488,"Even when the court convicts the crime, it can be against the law to apologize for the offenses committed by the criminal administration.
"
24489,"The prison can not even forgive the law, and the punishment can not be reduced further.
"
24490,"Despite this, according to the traditional tradition of Sri Lanka, the tradition of leaving 5 yard foods is being removed from the cottage.
"
24491,"The criminals who left the cadres thus left the Chhokhandi Minahha Pie of the imprisonment, mentioned in the verdict.
"
24492,"This trend is very well heard from other places other than Nepal.
"
24493,"Due to the need to secure the jail administration, the names of the criminals who have left the captive should be recommended only in the jail administration.
"
24494,"Thus, no person in the recommendation of imprisonment of imprisonment should be punished in the form of inhuman crime, death , robbery , throat , and drug treatment.
"
24495,"It is not time to leave captive prisoners only once a year.
"
24496,"Disciplined prisoners should abolish the practice of imprisonment of the Administrator and at the same time, the decision of the respective courtesy of courts should be left in the process of conduct improvement.
"
24497,"Nepal prison inmates in despair effective administration ( payroll ) in a suitable condition to leave the law is changed nowadays.
"
24498,"Operating the Prerequisites as a Refinance Center is a must to pay a payroll practice.
"
24499,"By starting this practice, it will reach the burden of discipline and criminal control within the prison.
"
24500,"All these tasks must be applied to all the autonomous services to the colonial courts in order to apply to the country's prison.
"
24501,"The current prison administration has been under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
"
24502,"There is no place where the initial conditions of the prison rules are kept there as they are kept under the house of the Home Ministry.
"
24503,"The modern prison to be inspected by these regular tour teams is an integral part of the administration.
"
24504,"When this important work is not done, the country has become a charitable institution in prison.
"
24505,"There is no possibility of progress in the country's jail unless there is a major change in the current administrative framework.
"
24506,"Various non-governmental organizations in the country have been operating development programs with success.
"
24507,"Until now, no association has been taken to make such union organizations surrender to the prisoners in prison.
"
24508,"Since there is no creative commitment in the prevailing prison administration, these important resources are not available in the country.
"
24509,"Only after the change in the jail administration, it can be attracted to such union organizations to provide service to the jail.
"
24510,"This is the reason why the following reforms are suggested in prison administration.
"
24511,"1 . As a prison reform committee, 2047, another Nepal prison reform permanent committee should be constructed and operated under this and all the prisoners of the country will be under this.
"
24512,"It should be for the permanent committee until the organization of the prison service and the restoration ministry.
"
24513,"2 . The permanent committee will be working to implement the suggestions given in this report for the overall administration of the prison administration.
"
24514,"5 . The permanent committee has to make at least two tour teams to make regular visits to each prisoner.
"
24515,"11 . The permanent committee will arrange to work for captives known as skipper.
"
24516,"( E ) Prison Organization :
"
24517,"Prisons of the Kingdom of Nepal Home Ministry of Government current organization of the prison, Mr. 5 great - sakhamatahata has been organized.
"
24518,"The present office of the prison supremacy has been established in the Tri - Devi road of Kathmandu .
"
24519,"Senior superintendent of this great - branch police service has been operating.
"
24520,"The task force report said prison authorities handed over to the police, although not mentioned in the great prison - Branch Senior Police Constable is not subject to opinion.
"
24521,"1 . Current state :
"
24522,"1 . Due to transferring the jail to the police administration, there is no positive creativity on the improvement of the jail.
"
24523,"Civil participation in police administration is difficult.
"
24524,"Prisoners will be developed in crime-related organizations by keeping the prisoners under the new organizational unit.
"
24525,"While presenting the jail under the police administration, the goal of providing personal development of criminals to this can not be a healthy competition system.
"
24526,"Due to the formation of police service and the training given to the youth, more emphasis is given to the regulatory side, there is no necessity of flexibility in the operation of the jail.
"
24527,"When the administration is not flexible, the reform party gets discriminated and unreasonable.
"
24528,"There was no corrective attitude here when studying in some visits to the country under the police administration.
"
24529,"2 . Recommended Suggestions :
"
24530,"It should be maintained under the Ministry of Separate Prison Services and Rehabilitation, under the Home Ministry under the Home Ministry.
"
24531,"Thus, the transfer of the jail administration under the ministry to be newly organized is also necessary for the new enrollment of the prison.
"
24532,"The organizational table of the proposed new ministry can be as follows :
"
24533,"The social facilities given in jail seem to be only possible from efficient management, which can be met with a coordinated functioning mechanism.
"
24534,"For example, the separate provision of sheltered babies is operating in the country with the success of child temple or a . Oh . S . The hair can be provided by the villagers.
"
24535,"Similarly, there are many ways to include dependent elderly people in the summer.
"
24536,"It is also a strong possibility to provide health services available to the health organization.
"
24537,"Additional features that are available from efficient and committed management and administration should not be explained.
"
24538,"Likewise legal services also show the potential possibility of self advocate or student of law.
"
24539,"Captivation income acquisition of prisoners is also possible from similar coordination.
"
24540,"When the state administration's prison administration is more profitable, sources of the education of the National Social Services can be attracted to the welfare of prisoners and prisoners.
"
24541,"Mr. 5's government needs to pay attention to the jail administration being more capable in the custody of capturing the service of prison administration and prisoners.
"
24542,"In present situation no jail services have been found in the custody of the jail administration without dynamic and creative.
"
24543,"Currently the jail administration is dependent on the Government of Sri 5, because there is no skill in the lack of commitment.
"
24544,"( F ) discipline :
"
24545,"After a long struggle and great sacrifices, democracy has come in Nepal.
"
24546,"The present situation of democracy is the yield of political discipline adopted by Nepali people.
"
24547,"The democratic environment that has been obtained from the dignity of discipline can be reversed in its absence.
"
24548,"The democratic qualities and duties of all the citizens of democracy are to take a tough bridge of discipline.
"
24549,"To strengthen the lowest democratic method here, any democratic government will take a policy to punish the dignity of discipline and punish those who oppose it.
"
24550,"In view of this possibility, now it is necessary for anyone in Nepal's prison to remain in the dignity of discipline.
"
24551,"If any person does any duty against the conduct of conduct, then it is called abortion of the law.
"
24552,"This law is punishable by that which is called morality of society.
"
24553,"Discipline and punishment will be united.
"
24554,"Prisoners will be educated at the time of the imprisonment, without giving strict dignity to discipline within the jail.
"
24555,"1 . Current state :
"
24556,"In prison, prisoners and prisoners do not have any specific rules , laws or conduct.
"
24557,"Notwithstanding this, the country's large - scale imprisonment appears to be in a delightful neighbor's environment.
"
24558,"Leave checked to the best of one another, which also held a meeting with anyone ( in time ) without stopping - freely receive.
"
24559,"There is no minimum inmates - rules are not applicable to the conduct of conduct, relative criminals, in comparison with other treacherous offenders, they get the confirmation of their guilt in the company.
"
24560,"Entertainment gambling tickets found in small towns in Nepal have not been stopped even though they are prohibited.
"
24561,"There is no definite impediment in the diet of food and other vineyards, and there is no limit in wearing clothes worn.
"
24562,"Without giving a rupee, those who have been punished for being punished in prison, have a family level consciousness of family level.
"
24563,"No kind of tables should be followed in the prison.
"
24564,"Here people always wake up in the morning.
"
24565,"It is prohibited to stay outside the chowk outside the chamber after day and day.
"
24566,"Food breakfast can be cooked at the same time as prisoners usually feel as they eat themselves.
"
24567,"There is no compulsion for bathing , bathing , cleaning.
"
24568,"Those who work in prison are known to work in regular times.
"
24569,"Outside relatives, there are no obstacles to ration and expenses.
"
24570,"( 6 ) Consumption and Employment : -
"
24571,"Understanding the reasons why families of middle class do not get food, because the number of family children or unproductive children is increased.
"
24572,"The size of the family in the Tharu society is larger than the other community, which means that 8 families are shaped.
"
24573,"Although other communities do not find more than 6 times.
"
24574,"Monthly months , middle or lower families have said that in the past 1 month, poor and Sukkavashi families have said about 4 months.
"
24575,"The months upabhogakonimti private sources - Smith Mahajan and landlords in cash , in kind used to discharge the debt is said to bring.
"
24576,"According to families, similar to unemployment problems, family members have said.
"
24577,"Out of which there are 5 families of middle class, 5 families in the lower class and 4 families of poor families and 4 families of Sukumanian families.
"
24578,"Comparatively, lower-family families have shown unemployment problems in low-level families.
"
24579,"Due to the fact that mango- rented work , skinny , drying , and the same is more important.
"
24580,"Age need to be unemployed , also 1 - 3 months to the tethered.
"
24581,"Other jobs in that area do not get anything open.
"
24582,"There is only one official cotton firm.
"
24583,"Where only 4 months are available throughout the year.
"
24584,"That too, the minimum wage - the monthly wage rate . 210. - I have to work.
"
24585,"Therefore, there is no more courage than farmers except alternative sources of loans.
"
24586,"( H ) Mahajani Practice and Rural Debt : -
"
24587,"The main source of rural debt is 2 types.
"
24588,"A private and other institutional - Bank.
"
24589,"Find out the interest rates of the loan at annual rate of 60 % , up to maximum 120 % .
"
24590,"In institutional resources, 23 families of all the families were found lending.
"
24591,"In the Terai region of West Nepal, the Mahajani practice was found in rural debt related trade and agricultural markets.
"
24592,"Per quintals up to Rs . Mix up to 100.
"
24593,"In addition to the market price other than the replicant . Up to 300
"
24594,"Thus, after getting the name of interest, the farmers found ' friends ' and made food directly to the farmers .
"
24595,"Often most of the survey said that the amount taken from the private sector and the amount of interest taken by the private sector.
"
24596,"The reason was , this was the result of this glorious practice.
"
24597,"Because farmers do not have enough money , how much money is left?
"
24598,"Another year, Ritu has to reach the same boss to buy the farmers' borrowers, and the whole family resides to the farmer to fill the cereals again.
"
24599,"This type of cycle found in this way for many years.
"
24600,"Once after taking the goods in debt or lending, the Mahajan gets the means to exploit farmers.
"
24601,"The farmer will never be saved from the debt nor is it possible to get rid of the exploitation of Mahajan.
"
24602,"This is such painful story and stories are filled with West , the peas of Nepalese terrain.
"
24603,"There is no sense of panchandise for such kind and gentlemen.
"
24604,"In contrast, the elements of such kind are preserving because they join the part and alliance with the two gentlemen and the Mahajanans.
"
24605,"The public voice raised up against the Mahjani practice was harshly oppressed.
"
24606,"( J ) Agricultural market : -
"
24607,"Farmers need agricultural market to access essential agricultural equipment in a convenient manner and to sell appropriate products to the appropriate product.
"
24608,"However, farmers of the villages in the survey, there are no other measures available in the district headquarters and markets of Indian border areas.
"
24609,"Due to the backward agricultural economy, the use of modern farming equipment was found in nutrients.
"
24610,"That's just the rich and the rich farmers.
"
24611,"Also, low-level farming of farmers, due to purchasing power, is also virtually low.
"
24612,"However , you should cut your stomach and buy some essential grains , fruits and livestock and buy daily essential other consumables.
"
24613,"But western Nepal's Terai region is monopoly of monopoly broker capitalists of Northern Territory of India.
"
24614,"Their monopoly remains in the wilderness area.
"
24615,"They determine the value of agricultural produce.
"
24616,"High quarters - most low levels of jamindaraharulaibaheka kisanaharukonimti clothing, salt, oil, adikonimti are forced to sell grain or livestock.
"
24617,"The value is determined on the self - interest of the community class .
"
24618,"It is normal to deceive farmers in measurement.
"
24619,"At the time of famine or famine, the same amount of food grains have to be purchased as much as they value.
"
24620,"If sold in such a way, it is also deceived if it is purchased.
"
24621,"Thus farmers are often exploited by exploitation.
"
24622,"In the absence of organized and managed agricultural markets, there is a huge amount of exploitation on the farmers and increasing monopoly practices and maintaining monopoly.
"
24623,"( A ) Problem of fuel and wood : -
"
24624,"There was a great deal of iron in that area.
"
24625,"The Government has kept nationalism organized by nationalization for the region.
"
24626,"It is said that the people should be prepared for the wood and wood.
"
24627,"But no one has ever been given the direction.
"
24628,"Some of the people went down to the grass, even when the forest vineyards told the incidents that they had tortured.
"
24629,"For wooden woods, the gaue also got some grain and was given to the vinegar and the police at the time of entering every crop.
"
24630,"But tyattile hurried to the police and vanapaleharu Village - Village caharera goat, chicken, noise, etc. It was found lurking.
"
24631,"Also, not only to send wood, but in reservation area, in turn, in the field of cultivated fields, the animals say that the animals have damaged crops.
"
24632,"Negative aspects
"
24633,"Episode : -
"
24634,"The study of the Western Terai shows the following conclusion
"
24635,"(1) grand tradition, the practice of bonded labor, and she felt a strong appearance of the ravages of feudalism.
"
24636,"On the other hand, Mahanjana practices and monopoly brokerages of the Indian border region are also increasingly increasing increasingly.
"
24637,"As the Pacific and the characteristics appear in some horizontal situations, colonial exploitation and characteristics appear to be increasing.
"
24638,"Nevertheless, in the context of the surveyed village, basically semi-semi and semi-colonial conditions appear.
"
24639,"(3) Rural antarabirodha, in particular, seems to landlords and mahajanasanga.
"
24640,"Government policies and regulations are seen as an obstacle for the development of rural areas.
"
24641,"Which are most of the panchayas.
"
24642,"Therefore, there is some complexity of the interstitial of that area.
"
24643,"There is a Panch administration on the one hand , which is often represented by the poor local landlords.
"
24644,"On the other hand, the monopoly of Indian monopoly brochures representing the capital.
"
24645,"They also have similar synthesis and alliance with the Punch administration.
"
24646,"3 . Village of Eastern Terai
"
24647,"General introduction : -
"
24648,"According to the survey , more than 60 % of the population of Mathali tribal communities and a total of 500 family families have a strong choice.
"
24649,"Where there is radicality of Piratebad under Hindu religious surname , it is not found in the Mathali community.
"
24650,"There is also peace in the village as well as the other minority caste and tribe's inhabitants.
"
24651,"There are mainly Muslim religious groups in minorities.
"
24652,"The ritual also found islamika as bigotry, and the village islamaharuma possible.
"
24653,"Though Hindu and Islam are well-known to religious rites, religious sectarian discrimination , radicalism is exactly found.
"
24654,"Although socially divided into diverse communities, social unity , equality and consistency are found.
"
24655,"The common and simple living style of all the communities is found , furnished and operational.
"
24656,"An innocence of injustice can not bear tolerance and instantly reflects the kind of opposition or reaction.
"
24657,"The worst practice of this society was the marriage and dowry practice.
"
24658,"Avibhabakaharuko days of youth being forced to marry someone, for some reason, mail can not be reached after the husband was to be automatically apehelita.
"
24659,"Women have no social status of remedies.
"
24660,"Due to this, many women were found to have lost their lives.
"
24661,"Similarly, it was a practice to give the daughter to the devil.
"
24662,"A chorikonimti at least 50/60 it is necessary to spend thousands of dollars.
"
24663,"Although the families found that some women were unable to get married due to poverty, 23 families surveyed have said that the problem of disease has dipped into debt.
"
24664,"Thus, in the eastern Terai region, the practice of the Daizhou practice is found that the common family is immunized in a living loan.
"
24665,"Even in the UK, which can be facilitated by geographical views, the situation in the area is very backward.
"
24666,"This type of cable is only one primary school in the village of denser is said that only 15 s. L. C. Found till
"
24667,"Leave a lot of higher education.
"
24668,"While trying to understand why the education sector is backward , the majority of the families is said to have a positive reason for the economic reasons.
"
24669,"This is a wonderful example of what the Panchayati government has given the effect of the direct impact of the policy adopted by the government.
"
24670,"The same situation in the health sector is the same.
"
24671,"According to the density of the population, one health center should not be opened in a health center.
"
24672,"It was dried to the health checkpoint ( about five kilometers ) away (in second Panchayat ) .
"
24673,"Similarly, the problem of fuel was very large.
"
24674,"Due to the lack of wood, the dung was used to dry dung.
"
24675,"People found the animal feeding due to fuel problems.
"
24676,"The main occupation of the residents of that area was farming.
"
24677,"Farming, especially rice, wheat, millet and cereal desire Missouri, khesari, sloth, green gram, cultivating the the world.
"
24678,"It has been partially divided into fruits and vegetables and magnesium.
"
24679,"The purpose of family consumption is to be cultivated.
"
24680,"In addition to farming, most families have also made some livestock work
"
24681,"The animals are found in cattle , buffalo , vakra, etc.
"
24682,"The farmer has a key base of livelihood.
"
24683,"But there are many problems in the agricultural sector.
"
24684,"Some have been discussed in detail.
"
24685,"1 . Land distribution
"
24686,"The ground is the basis of agricultural economy.
"
24687,"See the status of the land details if there is a case.
"
24688,"If it is based on the ownership of the family
"
24689,"Jindindar - 12 . 83 ( o )
"
24690,"Rich - 6 . 67 ( o )
"
24691,"Medium - 3. 12 ( o )
"
24692,"Poor - 0. 20 ( o )
"
24693,"The above mentioned land is found to be owned by the family.
"
24694,"This is the same as the currency exchange transaction.
"
24695,"In the said area, in the year 2022, the land has already begun.
"
24696,"When the landlord land reform - a successful landlords land to hide away any more land hadavandibhanda and distributed to the landless found.
"
24697,"The land also says that other families are consuming the land to be distributed to the residents.
"
24698,"Other families are consuming only for the land distribution of land.
"
24699,"20 family members of the 100 families surveyed on the distribution of land to the Greeks were found to have received the land alienation.
"
24700,"Opening ceremony
"
24701,"During the discussion speech, Honorable Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, considering the negative impact on the smoking children, now announced that he should not be cigarettes in the public place.
"
24702,"Participants of the Conference of Prime Minister's Anniversary
"
24703,"Prime Minister Koirala reiterated the government's commitment to child development and said :
"
24704,"I am happy to inaugurate the two day National Conference of non-governmental organizations working in child development organized by the Child Development Society.
"
24705,"Today's children are responsible citizens of the country who operate this country.
"
24706,"Therefore, their mental and physical development needs to be properly implemented.
"
24707,"I think, as long as the children do not get the dual personality development opportunities as long as any nation can not be a bright future.
"
24708,"The investment for children's development is the most important investment for the nation's development, which provides far-reaching results.
"
24709,"There are no jobs in the field of child development.
"
24710,"Similarly, we celebrated the SAARC girl's year 1 year ago, but when we look at their results and achievements, the situation is disappointed.
"
24711,"Lack of very common medicines , even in the country where this small population is , famine of millions of children is still going to die.
"
24712,"Fifty percent of the entire population are suffering from malnutrition, children 5 years searched, they have not been able to receive education, they are being exploited.
"
24713,"Social associations - The activities of the organization are not reaching those villages which are backward and where the ray of development has not reached.
"
24714,"Those children are completely unaware of the opportunity, which is the most needed.
"
24715,"But now that's not the case.
"
24716,"To complete this, you all need an active engagement.
"
24717,"In this context, law enforcement laws are going to be established, which will provide a firm foundation for strengthening the situation of the children.
"
24718,"About National Commission for Child Development.
"
24719,"The need for more frequent, which is coming up today, we have a positive viewpoint.
"
24720,"But there is no work done by the government sector only.
"
24721,"More often, social organizations of non-governmental organizations should play the most important role in this type of work.
"
24722,"The government will also have to provide necessary assistance to the development work done by non-governmental organizations.
"
24723,"In this perspective, I have considered this important national conference organized by the Child Development Society.
"
24724,"Speaking from the post of Chairperson, Hon'ble Honorable Representative of Duman Duman Nath Dhungana said :
"
24725,"In the conference, the social activist working in our society's giant personality and rural areas is a participant.
"

24978,"We have been presenting a pioneer concept towards developing our own character by multi-party democracy and to enhance the development of the country.
"
24979,"This is a perfectly new political party.
"
24980,"This team has not been compromised by any urgent requests in the name of the principle.
"
24981,"Current national political status
"
24982,"The independent system has become unacceptable.
"
24983,"The talk of that period also became irrelevant.
"
24984,"But that could not happen.
"
24985,"Soon the enthusiasm and unhappy society came to an end.
"
24986,"Naturally the return of that mental disappointment was the situation of social insecurity in the country.
"
24987,"Thus the government of the Congress - Left coalition coalition went to the government and administratively failed.
"
24988,"Now the government does not support the public.
"
24989,"There is no constitutional body or the way to show that it is not a surprise.
"
24990,"How reliable is the government running under the constitution and who is making the election ?
"
24991,"Differences of interconnected brotherhood and principles in political parties
"
24992,"Apart from our ideological differences, there is no conflict between us or any political party.
"
24993,"We believe that political parties should have mutual interest in promoting democracy.
"
24994,"There are parties standing for ethnic and regional rights in Nepal.
"
24995,"That's why other socialist and communist groups have already stood here.
"
24996,"If we are raised as a new party, we want to make clear that they have theoretical differences.
"
24997,"Those slogans of socialism will not give more programs or more than our imagination of the liberal democratic democratic state.
"
24998,"Because the socialism has maintained its existence, the condition has already ended long ago.
"
24999,"Today, the liberal rule - the system of social thinking is widespread.
"
25000,"There is nothing left behind the existence of socialism.
"
25001,"The message of Communism ( Communism ) has already ended, is from where it was the same.
"
25002,"Still, Communism has some arbitrarily in undeveloped or developing countries.
"
25003,"Communism has tried to make some impact in the Navy Burg.
"
25004,"We believe in democratic liberalism.
"
25005,"Our party has seen nationalism , democracy , development, and stability as an integral chain of the same.
"
25006,"The slogans of socialism represent the state as the director and director of the public.
"
25007,"Communists talk to monopoly and monopoly of kingdom power over this level.
"
25008,"Both of these approaches have failed in today's world.
"
25009,"Democratic liberalism eliminates this alliance and represents the role of the state in the advancement of the poor class and the vice president and co-worker rather than the operator.
"
25010,"( B ) current state of the country
"
25011,"On this reality, dedicated Nepalese people need to be alert in all the democracy.

"
25013,"1 . The Nepalese River Nala has announced that the government of the present Congress - Bam alliance is shared.
"
25014,"Every national lover Nepal has opposed this unfortunate view of Nepali natural resources.
"
25015,"2 . The Congress - Balam alliance leaders are now trying to remove Nepalese currency and demand for a common currency.
"
25016,"This is a Nepal-based step.
"
25017,"It is a conspiracy of the present government to make Nepal a financial settlement.
"
25018,"Ju money insecurity
"
25019,"The government of Left Left Alliance has failed to protect Nepali people from the JUI funds completely.
"
25020,"Administration and police are in conflict with being defective.
"
25021,"People are deprived of the lack of money security.
"
25022,"Democracy activity
"
25023,"1 . Nepali Nepali and Balak power both criticized the earlier security law against the unconventional and human rights demanding its dismissal.
"
25024,"Today, the same law has launched a campaign to oppose opponents, who are considered to be democratic and secured security law, internal elections.
"
25025,"There is no comparison of this foolishness.
"
25026,"2 . The current government has adopted the strategy to oppose the members of their workers and hire plates.
"
25027,"It is clear that this policy of limiting the right of the public and the establishment of secularism in the country is not a belief in democracy in both the power.
"
25028,"Directionless financial policy
"
25029,"1 . In the Jharkhand slaughtering of the people, thirty-five percent declined to declare, but today the situation is quite opposite.
"
25030,"Instead of reducing the price, people are getting rid of expensive killings.
"
25031,"2 . The promise given to the people was provided to the supply.
"
25032,"But not in the market until the salt.
"
25033,"There is also a wide increase in the vessel.
"
25034,"The absence of essential items like mantrate , salt , sugar and other food grains is going on in the village.
"
25035,"4 . The slogan for protection of the forest was given.
"
25036,"But the program of destruction of the forest, which has not yet been done in Nepal's history, was buried by the flag of Congress and Bam.
"
25037,"5 . The slogan of rural development was given.
"
25038,"However, in the eleven months, school construction , irrigation , drinking water , highway construction program was stopped.

"
25042,"8 . This government gave importance to party villa in every region of the country.
"
25043,"However, even in the educational field, like Tribhuvan University, the party also formed the Bond Policy.
"
25044,"9 . This government has ignored the poor and mountainous people.
"
25045,"10 . The tax which has been brought to the excuse of unauthorized property tax has gained anger on the poorness of Ghungur.
"
25046,"The earnings of the rural people and earnings of the richest sections have been given the same.
"
25047,"The real form of ruling parties, to give a furious slogan of raising and preserving the poor and lower bargains, has been deprived from the taxes tax.
"
25048,"The demand for the property to be illegally earned is the demand for the property, but this law has become legitimate property.
"
25049,"Thus, this is a fascinating example of the current economic policy of the current government, who is rich by exploiting the poor.
"
25050,"11 . This government has brought a policy of chaos in every region of the country.
"
25051,"The government's decision to change the decision-making within 24 hours made it clear to the lack of awareness of its instability and direction.
"
25052,"Widespread corruption
"
25053,"1 . The government has suddenly released several captives in substance and a few offenders, who were punished in an open case, were suddenly released.

"
25056,"3 . Today the market has increased the widespread lack of construction materials and value.
"
25057,"People are known by busy traders to earn a hefty amount of commissions through a limited amount of commissions.
"
25058,"Political ethics
"
25059,"1 . The Congress and the Balakshakti of the present interim government criticize the constitution made by itself.
"
25060,"But they also reside in the government under the same constitution.
"
25061,"What political morality is this ?
"
25062,"2 . The present Congressman has accepted constitutional monarchy as a symbol of national unity.
"
25063,"But in the speech and statement, tradition has begun to ridicule the monarchy.
"
25064,"The constitutional rule that has come under the constitution has begun to diminish the dignified politics of the same constitution.

26011,"Sandupalchowk Bhotechchaur resident is presenting its model.
"
26012,"They are taking the road in the new vadas of VDC.
"
26013,"Bhottachaurs have begun on construction of roads for three months.
"
26014,"The campaign has not yet been completed.
"
26015,"Their collective statement said that the road should be reached in every settlement and field.
"
26016,"So, Dhadanand Sapotoota, 71, has been around to make a road for about a month.
"
26017,"But do not give them any alkalinity.
"
26018,"The elderly Khandandand who has been waiting for a sweater, if there is a direct response to this, then I am ready to do so much more.
"
26019,"How many government officials say that the development of the village where they live, what they are doing is added.
"
26020,"It's not just a stand-alone but every gown that's going to go to this campaign is now included.
"
26021,"There is no one in the village where there is no labor force to reach the road.
"
26022,"Those who do not make roads should pay Rs. 300 a day, but that situation has not come.
"
26023,"In the past, residents of Sindhukkot neighborhood of VDC, made the Vinabajet's big rock and made similar roads.
"
26024,"That too became more inspiration for Bhatechaursauri.
"
26025,"They are not only new to the cow
"
26026,"Old roads have also been repaired and used to drive.
"
26027,"This campaign can now be a development message for other people.
"
26028,"If so, the construction of the road in public participation does not seem so much to reach the village.
"
26029,"Development plans will be successful in the same way.
"
26030,"Apart from the main road, Gaue has made up to 20 kms of auxiliary routes in the village.
"
26031,"If the government budget has made roads, more than one million has already been done.
"
26032,"From this, the government should also learn a quick lesson to develop the development plan that it is not only spending money by spending money.
"
26033,"They have made the importance of public participation more important for development.
"
26034,"Some people have also cut the wheat grains which have been planted to make roads, and the land has been vacated.
"
26035,"The street is rotated around the town.
"
26036,"There is no contradiction between them.
"
26037,"They have a collective desire to reach the road to the settlement.
"
26038,"Keeping the farm in the field of food is the first stop.
"
26039,"The desire to build roads in Bhotechaur and nearby village is historic.
"
26040,"033 In the 34 years, the residents of Bhak were suffering similarly to bring the road to the village.
"
26041,"The villagers remember to stay 13 km road on the outskirts of the capital, leaving the house along with Sutasamal and remembered that the worker Deep Bahadur Roymajhi of the time.

"
26043,"The main road connecting capital has reached facility to half a dozen VDCs.
"
26044,"The same engine has started coming from the capital for a decade from the capital.
"
26045,"Although the gaule is still crying to drive traffic on this road.
"
26046,"It has been a long time since they have traditionally been going to home to repair old roads.
"
26047,"It is not just satisfied with the main road, which is connected to Melamchi.
"
26048,"They want to make roads in the settlement to make a sustainable means for selling agricultural produce.
"
26049,"Due to which the freight will be easier, the income will also increase.
"
26050,"Famed as Western Naka in the district, Bhottachore and surrounding area of ​​the paddy wheat milk is considered to be famous for potatoes.
"
26051,"Due to this, rice has become a meal of Rs.
"
26052,"It is considered to be the food store of the district.
"
26053,"Of course the road will change its lifestyle.
"
26054,"So there is also a tracking route of Hamilu area of ​​Bhatechaur.
"
26055,"Lapidorjarga and Jugal Himal similar to a newly developed tea plant, and this Nagagali road can attract the mind of the tourists.
"
26056,"So there is a possibility of a tourist destination near Bhopechore.

"
26124,"Hathamar Vaidya, poverty alleviation from Rathathane technology
"
26125,"Depending on the organized system of organized agriculture sector, the production of other technologists can increase the yield.
"
26126,"Such a system is also in the interest of poor farmers, because the program is too small, even if the top level technology is slow enough, it will make the farmer easier.
"
26127,"It is easy to cultivate these technologies that are discounted on behalf of the community system for the irrigation system.
"
26128,"This pancake is like a delicious grape.
"
26129,"But this irrigation program also disrupts other obstacles to eradication of poverty.
"
26130,"My initial thinking was lost.
"
26131,"The news that was being read in the morning and the news that was broadcasting touched me more.
"
26132,"In fact, the economic and financial poverty of the poor could not be avoided.
"
26133,"The main reason for this is the signal that the development and publication of poor technology in the poor has fallen somewhere on TV broadcasts.
"
26134,"It should be a government and prosperous government in such a news.
"
26135,"On the other hand, the taxpayers' specialty and the media to understand the expenditure for the government is to understand that there is a positive result of all the research.
"
26136,"Scientific research is complex and takes time.
"
26137,"It is also expensive.
"
26138,"Research has come to a small selection of positive results.
"
26139,"It is other dismissal.
"
26140,"Biological research like cultures is more sensitive.
"
26141,"But if the simulation of success of such two Twelve is broad, poor farmers are rich.
"
26142,"If the farmer is rich, the society and the nation are strong.
"
26143,"This statement does not have to mention here that the agricultural program coming in the broadcast of Nepal TV.
"
26144,"The vu bars shown on TV on September 9 are the best of the chicken vessels like the best of the chickens.
"
26145,"Such a level of achievement does not show consensus for the promotion of the farmers as soon as possible.
"
26146,"The live simulation of the farmer side is also essential for poverty prevention.
"
26147,"According to the news on January 4, the government research team and farmer should not leave the dust in the coordination process of the Consumer Party.
"
26148,"The Kharmatar Center has not yet been interested in the scientific issues of the land.
"
26149,"This disease is a disease of farming land.
"
26150,"Poverty alleviation is also a matter of close relationship.
"
26151,"Unfortunately, the country is not able to do this and even for less investment on such scientific matters.
"
26152,"The problem was not resolved in consultation with the farmers above the Kunwar line, the farmers of Mahakkowar and its close-middle farmers became a Kuver.
"
26153,"Similarly, the useful technology that could be cultivated for middle class and farmers of the lower line, which could be reduced to poverty line, could not be developed.
"
26154,"This message may be searched on TV.
"
26155,"Such one-day news has lost the courage of scientists.
"
26156,"However, TV shows that in a clear and positive indication, the ability to study studies in Nepali scientists.
"
26157,"To continue their work, there is a need for the promotion and promotion of government level budget.
"
26158,"Therefore Nepal scientists are disappointed on the one hand.
"
26159,"Rural mechanisms of technology: Mantra of success: The basis of development policy of weak country is the use of wealth and resources in the country.
"
26160,"The use of the technology known to the locals is the first glimpse.
"
26161,"The use of local means is a quick startup.
"
26162,"Starting from Mr. Sankan simple and easy plan of development, is the shortest way of success.
"
26163,"A big plan is not easy to bring a big change to a poor country.
"
26164,"The smallest schemes that many people can do in the poor country bring great changes.
"
26165,"Just like a village village 50 houses a poor farmer brought a plan to bring a well to the land where one crop planted rice and asked for a cost of Rs. 1000.
"
26166,"Apart from their work, each house had discussed how much the rupee can be raised.
"
26167,"On the issue of Rs 5,000 per month from home per month, the demand for their demand was lost after Rs.
"
26168,"They are laughing
"
26169,"Work started
"
26170,"Go to the well, and the demand for the cement was reduced to 6 feet in a chamber.
"
26171,"Gaua slate was to stone.
"
26172,"Teach the technology to make the slate blazing and water cooling.
"
26173,"So they were their own owners.
"
26174,"They learned to worship and develop the spell.
"
26175,"Selfishness in the food.
"
26176,"Guo and society developed.
"
26177,"Poverty prevention: The headache of poverty prevention also starts with technology transfer, not moving before the set of dollars.
"
26178,"If a dollar or a rupee is spent, it is good to have only one third of the local resources policy rules.
"
26179,"A few years ago, after the government received financial assistance of 3 lakh rupees given to the Development Gov- ern Development Committees, it has been said that development of the project is equivalent to Rs. 12 lakhs.
"
26180,"Such functionality is not to be forgotten in the rural poor people.
"
26181,"Experts who have experienced such experiences and the technologists who have not learned it can not be used.
"
26182,"The use of the craft and technology is the basic utilization of the gow development.
"
26183,"Recently, the same one is called Mrs. Purantha, news, Kanantpur Mansir 15 Another example.
"
26184,"We have such skills but did not seek it.
"
26185,"The example of rural development, which is brought by the TV and the leaflet, is brought to the same public or not.
"
26186,"If such skulls are selected for district development in district district, then we have 75 such models.
"
26187,"It can be converted into national competition.
"
26188,"And may be the spinal cord of poverty.
"
26189,"If one can give district-level recognition, it will bring two people who do not know.
"
26190,"Such competition can be done in 35 rural irrigation systems.
"
26191,"Trivia was established in the year 2012.
"
26192,"It was dismissed in the year 018.
"
26193,"The program was kept under Panchayat Development.
"
26194,"After this, government employees were required to go to the village in the village.
"
26195,"Another program under the Tribhuvan University was the NDS National Development Program program that would go to the village by volunteer for 035 years from 035 years.
"
26196,"These three programs did not continue.
"
26197,"The government started programs to reduce poverty and to develop cows and started half-century by launching a five-year plan.
"
26198,"But the poverty problem has increased.
"
26199,"The commitment to budget as shown by the current financial plan did not come into the previous plans.
"
26200,"But due to different reasons, the development has not been taken to develop.
"
26201,"Why
"
26202,"The first thing is to grow upward from the bottom.
"
26203,"As we build homes, our developments are dollar-oriented before the drought reaches the ground.
"
26204,"The bottom floor looks very later.
"
26205,"This is the opposite, the emphasis has been added to the above mentioned methods.
"
26206,"I believe in it.
"
26207,"Secondly, parents should try four-step plan to prepare a child who can take birth to newborn children for 20 years of free life.
"
26208,"Poverty prevention program is also such a short term plan.
"
26209,"Its success depends on the parents who are preparing for their development in accordance with the age of the child.
"
26210,"Attachment in the development of poor mass is like a person of slow mind.
"
26211,"So they should start working with local people's wealth material that can wipe them sweetly.
"
26212,"The use of twenty-one centuries of knowledge, with the evaluation of the achievements of the first three events, shows that poverty should be made according to the society.
"
26213,"To prepare such an environment, poverty is reduced and poverty can be taken to ensure that the program is effective.

"
26395,"Price of gas and ride rental Sudip Shrestha
"
26396,"A computer is a printed list.
"
26397,"Small children of micro and clean tampoos do not even give less than a set in the list.
"
26398,"According to the consent of the government and the traffic practitioner, it is the obligation to raise the specified rent, which they have done full justice.
"
26399,"Anyone who has less than a specified dispute begins.
"
26400,"Contest ride
"
26401,"Do not grow public income, market value is always increasingly increasing.
"
26402,"The ride is not untouched by this.
"
26403,"But for the reason that the rent has increased, due to non-rentals also, it should be considered negligence of the concerned body.
"
26404,"Consumer consumers who use public transport including micro-cleaned tamps, including daily routines, are being hit by the negligence of the negligence.
"
26405,"The government had increased the refundand hundred rupees at the cost of LP gas on December 10.
"
26406,"In a mechanical system, the gas found in the 5050s then started 850 pounds.
"
26407,"After the price of the price, negotiations started with the increase in the freight of traffic between the traffic entrepreneurs and the traffic system.
"
26408,"In order to increase the value of one hundred rupees in a cylinders, it was natural to adjust freight.
"
26409,"According to the consent, the low-speed railway ride has increased from minimum 6 rupees to 7 rupees.
"
26410,"After the price of diesel, consumers were forced to accept the increase in the rented freight of consumers in all consumables.
"
26411,"There was no alternative in the country like Nepal, the consumer power and the level of use it was very low.
"
26412,"They have been making decisions by the businessmen and government bodies till today.
"
26413,"This is the same time.
"
26414,"But about a month after the government adjusted the market again and reduced the price per cent of the gas percillenger to Rs.
"
26415,"This decision against the belief that the value is always going to be sustained.
"
26416,"It was consumed by the consumers to rent the freight ride.
"
26417,"But the results did not come as they thought.
"
26418,"When the first gas prices increased, the traffic entrepreneurs who advocated in different areas need to increase the freight according to that.
"
26419,"Their silence is not uncommon as the business is always unprofessional.
"
26420,"But sadly, it is not just businessman but also a government to silence the interest of consumer interest.
"
26421,"The government could not provide the same willingness to provide relief to the consumers who started working with the private sector to increase the freight.
"
26422,"This can be a refund of the government body, which is a sixth distance racing ride in the Capital.
"
26423,"The rate fixed after the consent of the government and traffic practitioner has not been implemented in many areas.
"
26424,"The businessmen are raising their own freight.
"
26425,"The consumer has to pay 10 rupees instead of 8 and 8 in the prices of 7 rupees.
"
26426,"The rent rates vary in each vehicle.
"
26427,"Some of the cars going to Kalimati from the three sides take 8 to some 10.
"
26428,"The one whom you want.
"
26429,"Someone who has disconnected handles the same computer printed list on their hands.
"
26430,"And there is no alternative to silence.
"
26431,"In fact, the value of petroleum products does not affect the consumer's life.
"
26432,"After the fuel prices are increased, the value of other items that may be consumed by the consumer is to be adjusted.
"
26433,"In such a situation, the government does not reach only by reducing the consumption of gas to facilitate relief.
"
26434,"It can also be taken away from the effects of the market created.
"
26435,"The government is in the same position.
"
26436,"This also applies to the design of diesels.
"
26437,"In fact, to provide relief to consumers, the government should adjust the vehicle's freight according to the new price.
"
26438,"This is the case of the user in the present situation.
"
26439,"It does not give relief only to the microscopes and the tampos, which always ends the dispute between the passenger and the conductor.
"
26440,"Another question linked to Petroleum Pricing is a taxi's taxi's rent.
"
26441,"The price of taxi was increased according to the prices of petrol.
"
26442,"For this, every vehicle should go to the Department of Quality and Measurement and mix your Meter according to the new rate.
"
26443,"But today the month has not changed the taxi in all taxi even after the last month.
"
26444,"It has also become a reason to create controversy between passengers and driver.
"
26445,"In the taxi on the same taxi, the driver raises the new rate and takes more than the rented rent in the meter.
"
26446,"For example, the meter has risen 42 times, it is said to be 50 rupees.
"
26447,"In order to raise the freight at stake, it is justified
"
26448,"It is a technological point of renting on the taxi's mile.
"
26449,"No one should have to stay in such a dilemma if the meter is repaired.
"
26450,"The concerned body is not aware of it.
"
26451,"No taxi businessmen have been deputed nor the department has started.
"
26452,"Of course, it may take a while for hundreds of taxi meters to change.
"
26453,"But how much it should be, because the consumers will have to be more deceived as soon as the meter changes.
"
26454,"It is necessary that the department should apply a new rate to the relevant taxi immediately after opening the branch counter in different areas for meter change.
"
26455,"Indian mobile case case in Nepalgunj

"

"
27131,"He had promised to gather all the people who were on the hill and in the economic development of the mountain.
"
27132,"Chidambaram's budget is one of the most important evidence that the new government is the oldest of his father's father.
"
27133,"This budget, which has promoted poverty prevention programs, is an important step in maintaining India's high economic growth.
"
27134,"It is necessary to check this financial goal for solving problems that are not well-known as a disease-related disease.

"
27149,"The government of the past did not ignore the poor people, but it was a weak party to overtake most of the PU members in corruption and corruption.
"
27150,"After dismissing India's socialist economic policy in 1991, when it came to poverty by 36 percent in 1993, it came to 26 when it came to 2000.
"
27151,"Chidambaram's budget for poverty prevention is only a test.
"
27152,"Poverty reduction, or poverty, is the effect of how it impacts.
"
27153,"Some of his proposals have been widely welcomed.
"
27154,"Chidambaram has hoped to get relief to the Indian farmers who are seeking debt from the bank by raising the loan for the current financial year by 30 percent.
"
27155,"But his other plans have become quite controversial.
"
27156,"The Finance Minister argues that the grant of the protection criteria for the poor people, but the economic reformer does not agree.
"
27157,"This means that operating maximum PG in this year, the government will be forced to reduce financial deficit as per the target two years.
"
27158,"Although Chidambaram has the option to track the financial deficit of the country.
"
27159,"I have made a serious commitment in return of financial reforms in the financial year 2006 07.
"
27160,"Chidambaram's budget has already achieved some of the most important achievements, not to the extent of the socialist economy policy of the past.
"
27161,"He has centered the budget for various programs on poverty prevention, which does not hurt the middle and wealthy class.
"
27162,"It has become clear that poverty prevention and economic sub-mobilization is not a controversial target of India.
"
27163,"The stock market of Mumbai increased by 2 percent by 2 percent on budget speech.
"
27164,"Most of India's new advancements are acceptable to everyone in the future.
"
27165,"Although this step is very likely to get poor opportunities and gain access to them.
"
27166,"It seems that there is a possibility of Yehner Chidambaram's plan to help the poor of India to reach the poor.
"
27167,"These corrupt ones work to seduce the land and increase poverty.
"
27168,"Economy is also aware of this challenge.
"
27169,"We have made it available as our responsibility for the purpose of conducting Pu and operationally operational, ""he said.
"
27170,"In that budget speech, he indicated that India's employees are compressed and in the mindset.
"
27171,"However, Chidambaram has shown both the government's desire and the PU to help the poor.

"

"
28650,"Rathan Kumar Kumar, who adds Kathmandu to Kathmandu
"
28651,"There was a lot of controversy about what the fast highway linking Kathmandu.
"
28652,"The inhabitants of Lalitpur want to have Bagmati corridor, and Sarlahi residents also want to make pathways in Bagmati for the uplift of poor people.
"
28653,"Similarly, in some Bagmati corridors, the tourists want to make a tour road with a low-speed road.
"
28654,"The instant highway is an international level express highway.
"
28655,"Such roads should be at a distance of at least four lines and short distance as far as possible.
"
28656,"In addition, we have a geographical location that we never forget.
"
28657,"The geographical structure has been ignored in the discussion about the fast track.
"
28658,"In contrast, some experts may have to make a large tunnel due to geological reasons, because Hateau has made roads in Bagmati corridor than Kathmandu.
"
28659,"What is a routine route to the highway highway going to normal transport and a place to another place?
"
28660,"Potential route
"
28661,"1 Bagmati Edge:
"
28662,"In the country where mountainous mountain is the perfect route to the road.
"
28663,"But to make a fast-moving structure, we should pay attention to the widespread river banks.
"
28664,"Because of not being kept in the fast path, that tunnel or large and high bridges in the moving place are necessary.
"
28665,"Apart from this, the mainland should be cut from 20 to 25 meters to make the four line road.
"
28666,"It is possible that on the banks of the Bagmati, there is a possibility of two possibilities on the banks of the Bagmati, which will reach the shore along the banks of the Terai.
"
28667,"At first, only to remove the Terai from the Bagmati coast and to the other side of the Chagamati river, after coming to Chure mountain, you will get to Birgunj by Nijgarh.
"
28668,"The main objective of the traitors of these routes is to make poverty faster than Lalitpur and Makwanpur along with making quick and easy highways with Birgunj.
"
28669,"In addition, the fastway will increase the source of income from the roads connected to the roads of the villages of the adjoining region.
"
28670,"It's a wrong idea.
"
28671,"The access to the villages is only a certain place in the fastway.
"
28672,"Rides are going on the roadway, but crossing the road from crossing of certain places and place of residence.
"
28673,"This is the reality of the fastest.
"
28674,"So it can not be shared only with rural development.
"
28675,"Similarly, the geographic problem of engineering at Bagmati edges is also important.
"
28676,"In some places Bagmati flows only 10 meters wide.
"
28677,"Now think about how much geographical movements should be taken to cut the 20mm and how many geographical movements should be passed, the process of the mountain will not fall and the fall of the process starts.
"
28678,"Also, rocks are formulated in the said areas.
"
28679,"Second probable route
"
28680,"This route has geographically been found out of the pre-estimated study spent over 18 months.
"
28681,"Japanese and Nepali engineers and geologists have fielded the geographical conditions of this route and the strength of rocks are more suitable than other places.
"
28682,"Many researchers who have experienced experience and construction experience in this area have not been able to study this route yet.
"
28683,"Terai connecting road or rail
"
28684,"It is said that Kathmandu will be suitable to connect railways to the Terai.
"
28685,"Seeing the Bagmati edge is selected for the railway, the geographical side is automatically ignored.
"
28686,"In some places, some mountains should be cut off for railway.
"
28687,"Even if the thought of railways is to be geographically constructed inappropriate routes, it is necessary to make the proposed Kathmandu-based Hetauda straightway.
"
28688,"But study can not be reached without squeezing.
"
28689,"Various study reports are also inappropriate that it is not appropriate to say that roadways by road and railways.
"
28690,"The construction and operation of the BOT or Nicobar construction transit policy has already been implemented for the Kathmandu route.
"
28691,"The private sector and the banks have been collecting huge amount of money in the past, and investment opportunities are being shaken.
"
28692,"There is also a status to bring international investment to the private sector.
"
28693,"If the private sector can not be included in the fast path which connects to the Terai with Kathmandu, we have policy with the slightest problem.
"
28694,"Private sector and huge potential of investment.
"
28695,"But our decision is to come to a mechanism or what the friends of the United States who are truly helping in the development of others are quite fond of.
"
28696,"Friendship has been heard by Japan.
"
28697,"Two city express highways are added on the basis of the Nihilya policy in India.
"
28698,"Truck drivers are opening the card through a computer by rotating the card.

"
28824,"Both of these indignations were closed.

"
28834,"Bilateral and multilateral donors are not allowed to invest.
"

"
28836,"Nepal has not been able to become a coin if its claim is not relevant to its water.
"
28837,"Because the main structure of irrigation is up to 40 kilometers from reservoirs.
"
28838,"There is more discharge of water in the ratti.
"
28839,"There are other projects against India.
"
28840,"India had done similar to Bagmati and Babai irrigation.
"
28841,"While Vice President Bamdev Gautam was deputy minister, Babai decided to invest only by the Nepal government so that water rights were safe.
"

"

"
28858,"On the other side, Indian farmers are often getting free electricity.
"
28859,"Their production is cheap.
"
28860,"That is why the price of agricultural goods produced by the expensive electricity is more likely.
"
28861,"We do that, the cheap Indian Indian farmer is dead.
"
28862,"But there were many ways to make cheap.
"
28863,"Instead of the design of its design, electricity is a major use.
"
28864,"One said that the government had taxed on the air as well.
"
28865,"That means that the citizens would have to become a mechanism to pay even when they were inhaled.
"
28866,"The Electricity Authority can not want or relieve consumers.
"
28867,"Because his holes are big.
"
28868,"Resources that flow from that hole should be used through the consumer.
"
28869,"Otherwise, the use of the power consumed for the night, Deep Tubewell, would have already earned cheap electricity.
"
28870,"Due to the obligation to pay the tax on two months by using electricity for two months, most of the tip's dip tube wells are closed.
"
28871,"Although the authorization rate, the rate of irrigation is higher than the normal rate.
"
28872,"In his statement, irrigation will reach three rupees sixty rupees, which is about half a half less than the average monthly.
"
28873,"Now the authorization is raising this rate for two rupees forty dollars.
"
28874,"The Authority has decided to make the only money used by the government to make it cheap.
"
28875,"It will certainly bring relief to the farmers who lost competitive potential.
"
28876,"The revenue of this Authority does not decrease.

"
29140,"Ghajal singing is ringing around.
"
29141,"It is not only written by that person.
"
29142,"Today, there are thousands of listeners of Ghazal.
"
29143,"Therefore, the work of writing a ghazal out of the structure should stop.
"
29144,"Before traveling as a campaign, readers should advance before singing.
"
29145,"As a ghost writing is muted, singing should be started.
"
29146,"Madanika Patriarch: Modernity Prayer of Clarity and Simplicity Reference
"
29147,"26 In the context of the famous novel in Kantipur of Fergun, the author of the famous writer Madanani Dixit has come to know about clarity and simplicity.
"
29148,"He said in a clear word, I do not have to write to everyone because I know.
"
29149,"I have received this teaching from the famous novels.
"
29150,"The reader does not have to criticize.
"
29151,"This clear self-expression of mature and veteran writers is a serious form of subject matter for the infinite and new generation writers.
"
29152,"But the truth and simplicity are not always absolute forever.
"
29153,"Ramnayana's death anniversary and residence of Bhanwakkot have been the most descriptive works of Nepali literature.
"
29154,"Its main reason is not only the simplicity of the language but also the subjective feature and craft side that can be readable by readers.
"
29155,"If the simplicity of the language would be popular only by the language, Gau would be popular for all the novels written in the language.
"
29156,"On the other side there is also a linear writer who seems to have a modern and excellent literature in simple language style.
"
29157,"That is, in their view, it is a great literature that can craft a sharp mirror of the artificial language by crafting the reader's paper.
"
29158,"Fortune is just one thing for them to put in one way that they will be inexperienced.
"
29159,"In fact, literature is not a complete interpretation like Purana Vajpayee or a political speech.
"
29160,"The poetic language is also closed, and Gulab is also speaking, and the audience is listening to the audience.
"
29161,"But that unit is only part of the literature.
"
29162,"If the totality was the same, the reader could read the poems and novels in a rare Captain.
"
29163,"The opening of the flowers and the eyes of the Himalayan mountains found the whole taste of the epic.
"
29164,"Writing for clearly explaining the fact that literature has many objectives.
"
29165,"Or to make the reader more logical and sensitive in a simple complex, diverse style.
"
29166,"Or if the iron chutera is blown and others can not afford to work, instead of exercising themselves as a supernatural actor.
"
29167,"It is not a master who is known to be famous.
"
29168,"These people are not willing to put their brain by paying a taring mirror.
"
29169,"That is why the writer has experienced the experience of many readers.
"
29170,"In fact, the interest and tendency of the ambition is simple and easy.
"
29171,"Arts Pant has been popular due to the trend of Tuna Bachchan's visit.
"
29172,"People have got motor vehicles and planes due to the rise of light and stone.
"
29173,"If a person likes clarity, just want to pluck the bus and the plate with a heavy load.
"
29174,"But the people did not understand that and made a sacrifice of goddess, many head hands were more than a man who had a strange shape.
"
29175,"These are all obvious that the desire of a person lies towards simplifying complicated things.
"
29176,"A few people are able to enter complexity.
"
29177,"Scientific discovery and experimentation of science can maximize the complexity of the maximum density depth.
"
29178,"But not only to complicate the purpose of their purpose, to make light of complex mystery or simplifying the hidden rules.
"
29179,"It is easy to make newsletter updates easily and easily fill in your email address.
"
29180,"In all these references, it is important to pay attention to Deepaji's trivial experience.
"
29181,"I feel that I am aware that in the context of the landmark, I would not have to write that everyone might know.
"
29182,"But on the craft of Madhya Pradesh, it has expressed satisfaction.
"
29183,"Madhvi Uhko is a great achievement and an important achievement of Nepali novelty.
"
29184,"However, such works that were considered so intricate about the standard society could also be made to reach even a broader reader that it is necessary to pay attention to it.
"
29185,"I have found many of the readers of educated class who have been studying the books half of Madhvi's language and presentation.
"
29186,"Also, the writer should work more than that.
"
29187,"I feel that the majority of the reader's ability to read reader and the level, if meditation was meditated, Madhavi also made a simple point of view and could be reached to many readers.
"
29188,"Similarly, the landlord could be easily understood and understood.
"
29189,"He became a member of the Dedicated family as a tradition of tradition in both Vedic and cosmic cultures.
"
29190,"So the word Vedic Sanskrit also became like simple.
"
29191,"These words attempted to maximize the works, and because I understood that everyone understood that.
"
29192,"Such thinking felt like a messy thing.
"
29193,"It is the author's specialty to easily compile any complex and complicated topic into its simple language.
"
29194,"The story of Sumanima is too old but VP Koirala has presented a simple way to the reader.
"
29195,"Rahul Sankrishnan has made such an old theme very simple.
"
29196,"Vedic literature is very small in Nepali society.
"
29197,"The Dalits were not allowed to listen to the Vedas, but the tribes would often not allow them to come.
"
29198,"I have a feeling that there are many people who read Chandhi in Nepali society.
"
29199,"Even though she was written later, her story was old.
"
29200,"Many readers can get access to the example of what the people have heard.
"
29201,"But, in the Madhya Pradesh, Dikshit tried to encourage other characters in Vedic and mythological sage to promote autism.
"
29202,"Later, he accepted the singing from the ancient texts to Chandi to give the land to autonomy.
"
29203,"That author is welcome to accept.
"
29204,"The poet's power and the era of eve greeted
"
29205,"For a long time, this sacrifice was kept in the courtyard of the Kariritpur Campus.
"
29206,"It has been a long day since its birth day.
"
29207,"Long ago, some students of Massachusetts talked about Murthy.
"
29208,"The students of the Nepalese Department have more interest and activism.
"
29209,"Just look.
"
29210,"Two student Pushpa Raj Acharya and Suresh Ranabat Hijangung, who were home to Tanha.
"
29211,"They were worried about their face.
"
29212,"How many times have I seen him walking in the context of that year?
"
29213,"They said that we have been a bit upset.
"
29214,"By whom we unveiled this year, we have come to ask for advice by faith.
"
29215,"I see the illustration of the power structure of Nepalese society in the face of Tejila youth.
"
29216,"I know that the authors who were supposed to be a murmur before, kept them first.
"
29217,"Their choice had some names.
"
29218,"The challenges of a young man are in choosing a hero.
"
29219,"They are dumped in the past and the time of coming time.
"
29220,"They choose the heroic crown in history.
"
29221,"Take the protagonists from the education.
"
29222,"The first generation says the triangle we are to steal us.
"
29223,"We have made you.
"
29224,"Trinity is our intelligence.
"
29225,"We have experience.
"
29226,"On the other hand, there are models of heroes or rollmodels, whose clothes are brought to suit the examples of boldness and howau youth.
"
29227,"The youngsters who compose only the role of their role in Rolmore and not give priority to the first.
"
29228,"They are considered to die.
"
29229,"But it is simple for the students of a literature department to keep a strong poet in front of his own department.
"
29230,"But I am talking about this campus courtyard where I have always been able to fly the wings of young powers and fly and fly again.
"
29231,"I have measured this rise from the rise and fall of the power of Nepali history.
"
29232,"Yo Aan Gunn Marimiam is a syllogram from which I have measured the geometry of 6 racer scale in Nepali history.
"
29233,"This is a matter of communication between Nepalese politics and a stock of power history.
"
29234,"Here I have seen many heroic politicians of the school and have seen the dance and the dance.
"
29235,"My classroom I have left behind.
"
29236,"A number of natural times came in the garden.
"
29237,"Here I am a student from a huge tree.
"
29238,"How many of us were weeping?
"
29239,"I have seen many times in the sky and the seasons of uncertain knowledge from the angle of the leaves covered with leaves and leaves.
"
29240,"I am a deck under the shade of his shadow.
"
29241,"They cut one.
"
29242,"That house has a long home.
"
29243,"This is an interpreter of this house.
"
29244,"Now it is my duty to be a great supporter of this house.
"
29245,"I see young decided to make Lakshmi Prasad Devakota the death penalty.
"
29246,"He collected some money and brought Marwatrikrishna Krishna Joshi.
"
29247,"According to the advice of a rocky pen, they brought black grains of fishery and prepared a sacrifice.
"
29248,"Make the first step.
"
29249,"The superstition of the superstition was invisible.
"
29250,"It was in the artist that the student was in a union room.
"
29251,"A dimension was completed after the selection and sacrifice of Shilkhand were prepared.
"
29252,"After this, the student started searching for another living murmur.
"
29253,"The person who unveiled it was discovered.
"
29254,"Concerns of Nepali youth worry about history.
"
29255,"They travel a long journey in search of past and present heroes.
"
29256,"His journey can also be education, and this may have been a lot of time lost.
"
29257,"The peace deal in the silent deal in the history of the hero and the Jue Da Nayak remains the last.
"
29258,"Young people are involved in them.
"
29259,"But the death penalty of the supporter does not appeal to them, but opens their horizons.
"
29260,"But if he does not find the perfect hero in the unmarried person, he will produce different kinds of meaning.
"
29261,"The answer to their questions was Marinesimati easy.
"
29262,"I told Satyamohan Joshi, because of this, you were worried because both of them gladly gathered together.
"
29263,"I have added Satyamohan is a friend of brother-in-law, this is not the case of many historians.
"
29264,"Like these great men were also very loving friends.
"
29265,"Satyamhan Dai, two languages, can create similar creative and unique in Nepal.
"
29266,"He is a man who has been working in a large area of ​​Nepali culture and theater and the public.

"
29268,"They are so wealthy that the craftsman is the literature writer and the ability to have no filing is the power of thirty c.
"
29269,"These 85-year-old pedestrian hikes a tropical cap with a gray cap in the head at the age of 85.

"
29271,"Our ordinary community has come to the table and according to our cousins, the districts which are gurukul in the district, like us, are stuck in the same way.
"
29272,"They do not go too much in the wealthy riches and riches of devotees.
"
29273,"They go to the section where they go, but they are shouting, because of the wisdom of his Nepali culture, the superficial people look like a cloud of Tugha in Nagarjun.
"
29274,"Why did young people choose to die, this question made me bitterly.
"
29275,"The state is the most powerful basis to show the power of the power.
"
29276,"Architecture enables people to compose civil composition and power.
"
29277,"The worshiper becomes a great sacrifice.
"
29278,"But in the war of power there are silent battles of death.
"
29279,"There are fun structures in the patient.
"
29280,"But, there is also a decline in nationalist thinking by Murthy.
"
29281,"The residents are surprised to keep the name of the road in the name of one foreign leader by side of a roadside road.
"
29282,"There is a road called Joseph Brij Tito Marg in Delhi.
"
29283,"Keeping the friendship between the friendship and relationships on the streets of your city is a unique political character.
"
29284,"There is no political change in the death sentence of Mahakavya, nor his death means any political change.
"
29285,"But a politician does not keep a strong male woman, keeping it a yearly and keeping a murmur of a poet has a high price difference.
"
29286,"I do not see the boyfriend in life.
"
29287,"His face is the photography and the merit of Marinesamati.
"
29288,"This murmur is not so effective, but it is symbolic.
"
29289,"There was a few people who had come to open the universe with a few people around half a century ago.
"
29290,"He also looked at other things.
"
29291,"But after coming here, the heart of the poet was shattered.
"
29292,"But the Himalayan queue, poetry of Fig and the Vigitaparari farm, became a poetic appearance to the poet, as the calmness of Karirertipur's calm and green environment.
"
29293,"She listens to her.
"
29294,"It took the kingdom from the farmer of Kariripur.
"
29295,"Do not give good compensation.
"
29296,"Due to the people of Karirtipur, it did not give scholarship and other education opportunities.
"
29297,"This work was not done in the University of Karirpatpur.
"
29298,"Tribhuvan University Kariritpur was the only institution to bring the civilization of the country and showcase it.
"
29299,"His motivation was to educate young people and adults in the country's respect and opportunity.
"
29300,"A intellectual class of the country was composed.
"
29301,"Some have misused the university.
"
29302,"That's what's up.
"
29303,"First campus, the first Vice-Chancellor, Suvarnasher Rana, is the first sacrifice.
"
29304,"In a post-graduate texture, here today, the professor Govinda Bhattarai imagined him and my invisible sister-in-law around the Salaik Rana, in the book of Agnipuja 2061.
"
29305,"At the time of departure, that student of Agnihotri was an advanced modern architectural avatar.
"
29306,"That is symbolic.
"
29307,"After the teacher's time and dream work many times, the same university campus is composed.
"
29308,"We have
"
29309,"There are also the elders.
"
29310,"This year's epic is a legendary symbol of the story of these colleges.
"
29311,"Perhaps the construction of mortar composition and mortality for the interest of central Nepalese department is probably possible.
"
29312,"But to make a definite formula, it is a departmental policy to create antitrust and use that standard.
"
29313,"The Nepali Department also works.
"
29314,"In the criticism of Mahakavi, the words have been made in Nepali.
"
29315,"Today, Nepal's time is a mixture of solar composition and manufacturing.
"
29316,"Sometime ago, at the day of night, to the day of Des Dichael.
"
29317,"It was June.
"
29318,"The smoke of the day was uninterrupted in the air.
"
29319,"In the past, at the time of Rana Premier Ardhayaya, the expression of the past was to show that it was wise.
"
29320,"In the city of Europe, I have seen that there is a lot of time standing on the road from various stages of history.
"
29321,"Remember
"
29322,"Do not worry, I'm on a lot of occasions.
"
29323,"But your dose is different.
"
29324,"Every mortal is known because they are the graves of their own history.
"
29325,"Go to the Assistant Corirpipur again.
"
29326,"Just a short time.
"
29327,"The student did not have a lot of scenario in the form of Mahabavi.
"
29328,"But look at the face of your own time in its shape.
"
29329,"I imagined not to see him, his heart was such an uncertain and highly meaningful sacrifice.
"
29330,"Creation and dissolution of the superstition of Mahavkrav has made my literary consciousness.
"
29331,"Her fame has composed a power.
"
29332,"In the efforts of student students, see the power of a creative power in the year, unveiled by Satyamohan Joshi on the day of Education Day 2061 in the courtyard of Karirpurpur University.
"
29333,"Ask what they are saying.
"
29334,"Answer the answer from the crazy poem, you are a stranger, I am liquid, and you wake up when you embrace when I become bully.
"
29335,"Do not stop that silence dialog.
"
29336,"Look at the voice of the person who has been punished by the gangster's poet, when the dark-colored printed narrative leads my fascinating lie to a fake lie.
"
29337,"His family was manufacturing unmanned power structures and probably said that my friend is crazy like me.

"
29348,"I was worried about getting the telephone that was unnecessarily surprised by unknown reasons.
"

29985,"In the upper house, the report could have strengthened the report to correct the discrepancy and the implementation of the suggestions.
"
29986,"Public publications should be discussed and administered the guidelines to the administration.
"
29987,"Interestingly less developed countries
"
29988,"The regional meeting of the Regional Organization of South and Eastern Asian Nations Committees Committee, which started on Tuesday in the capital, has increased on Tuesday before the discussion on draft trade agreement.
"
29989,"More importantly, in these areas of business liberation, the protection of the less developed countries, which will ensure a safe future of the country like Nepal within a multilateral trade network.
"
29990,"Due to low growth level, Nepal's productivity production cost is less competitive than the developing countries.
"
29991,"Therefore, international markets do not have the capability of internal markets, but Nepalese products are naturally behind the door.
"
29992,"In such a situation, other highly developed partners of BIMSTEC are also Bangladesh and Bhutan.
"
29993,"Being affiliated in the regional economic organization is not enough for the landlocked country only.
"
29994,"For this, develop-oriented partners like India, Sri Lanka, should provide some facilities and technical assistance.
"
29995,"The participants will be considered success in the same meeting that can reflect the same requirement in the commerce business agreement.
"
29996,"In comparison to the structural draft of BIMSTEC's Free Trade Agreement, compared to the Safa and WTO c, it is low to the less developed countries.
"
29997,"The special provision for them is to give more time to cut accordingly, which can only be named.
"
29998,"BIMSTEC has not even included the arrangements for the compensation of the damage caused by the repayment of the law arranged in Safta.
"
29999,"For this, Bangladeshi raised the voice in the beginning, it has been continuously weak.
"
30000,"Domestic countries such as Nepal, which have more share of customs in the total revenue, can be a major problem in the domestic source operations due to customs cut.
"
30001,"The meeting should emphasize the need for such treatment in the bimstak, as it is the arrangement for its treatment in Safta.
"
30002,"Apart from this, the technical assistance given to the very developed countries is not the priority in the drafting of trade agreement.
"
30003,"There is a need to be very low-developed nations to bring themselves a technical support program.
"
30004,"It is mentioned that the tariff should be reduced to zero by 2017.
"
30005,"It should be clear before Safta gives a discount to maintain zero percentage percentage of zero.
"
30006,"Similarly, in the provision of anti dumping, BIMSTEC has not given the exemption to the very small development.
"
30007,"Even when preparing a list of sensitive items, the same kind of generosity is very good for a less developed group.
"
30008,"The timetable of BIMSTEC's free trade structure has yet to be done, due to this, very few developed nations should be grateful for these issues.
"
30009,"It is necessary to prepare a shared concept.
"
30010,"The very less developed group will get proper priorities in all its multilateral platforms unanimously before their perception and requirements.
"
30011,"Proper management of education
"
30012,"In a column, four teacher writers and four class students have learned that they should move and move their lessons.
"
30013,"In such a situation how many tension may have caused by a teacher and a reader.
"
30014,"News has been taught by students of three and four students in the same class, and has revealed a desperation of government education system.
"
30015,"There are at least two classrooms in Nepal National Primary School in Fadapurpur Aadda da of Bara district.
"
30016,"One child and one classroom living in one, dozens of students of four classes in the other.
"
30017,"Such a situation is not a day or a year, but it has been continuously for seven years.
"
30018,"Now the teachers, who became a journalist doctor engineer, had liked similar situation to earn their early education.
"
30019,"No one of them had lost four classes in the same room.
"
30020,"The text of such hundreds of schools must have changed now.
"
30021,"In some cases at the beginning of the beginning, if such situation is considered normal, seven seven years can not be considered as comfortable as it is.
"
30022,"It is beyond the assumption that many other students of the country may suffer similarly.
"
30023,"Because government bodies do not have such school costs or researchers' concerns.
"
30024,"In the urban areas there is a huge difference in the level of primary education.
"
30025,"Curriculum and curriculum courses in the government and private sectors of the third sector have a variable difference.
"
30026,"There is also no public debate on the construction of the curriculum and its impact.
"
30027,"In some rural schools, students are educating only names.
"
30028,"Even more, the school has to leave the grandfather's school, so many schools are closed.
"
30029,"Primary education is the basis of future education.
"
30030,"It is difficult to estimate what the student has learned from each of the lessons taught in the same room as a sheep goat, keeping each one in special supervisory and teaching children.
"
30031,"In such a situation, teachers and students' attention can not be found on the reading of teaching.
"
30032,"Through the means of identifying all kinds of inequities, education is especially important in developing countries.
"
30033,"Nobel-winner Amartyssen, who has been proclaimed in the UK from Bill Gates, the world's richest person, has regarded education as the most important topic.
"
30034,"Bill Gates has given a grant to the program to provide grants to the education sector throughout the world from the trusts established from his property.
"
30035,"Sen has also opened its prize trusts from the money received from his Nobel Prize, and part of the research of primary education in India.
"
30036,"We also have the study of study research to make the primary education effective for primary education.
"
30037,"Vigilant research will not only publicate the number of other schools like Amadas, but it will also be helpful to make the necessary programs in that area.
"
30038,"If there is an effective program, different experiences like lack of lack of donors who invest in education sector for minorities and poor countries like Nepal.
"
30039,"The aggregate status should be initiated to improve immediately.
"
30040,"Regardless of the uncertainty, the child is educated without the hands of the next country, if it is educated.
"
30041,"Therefore, the state-owned non-governmental community and civil society should have a special role in implementing effective primary education.
"
30042,"Human Rights High Meeting
"
30043,"Nepal is also facing the main agenda of the joint meeting of the United Nations High Commission to review the status of worldwide human rights.
"
30044,"The Cambodia Afghan Highway, which will be held in Senegal, will be reviewed from Sudan Sierra Leone to China, in the meeting held at Geneva, a 6-week High Commission headquarters from Monday.
"
30045,"Even then, the government seems to be very cautious to prove that every member of the Human Rights Commission should stop the commission from leaving the capital.
"
30046,"The chairman of the commission to become a participant in the high-level meeting, banned the wishes of other members besides the Nain Bahadur Khatri, who does not see the government's commitment to human rights.
"
30047,"Similarly, the activities of informal involvement in the Geneva meeting of non-governmental communities have decreased due to recent activity.
"
30048,"The perception of the state-owned human rights activist could not only be able to portray the balanced state of the country but also to be a means to assure international universities.
"
30049,"Special activation of the High Commissioner of India, due to special activism, had prevented Nepal's proposal from being passed in the meeting report.
"
30050,"The government had issued a commitment to 25 bids in the international community.
"
30051,"The government is under pressure on the commitment they can not follow.
"
30052,"The political community, which made the political leader release the freedom of press release and preservation of human rights, is not able to satisfy the government's answer.
"
30053,"Frequently Prime Minister and Nepali Congress
"
30054,"The last release of Democratic Chairman Sher Bahadur Deuba is expected to be the answering strategy in the adjacent High Commission meeting, rather than the change in political perceptions of political analysts.
"
30055,"It is necessary to immediately release the leaders and workers of the detained custody to release such estimates wrong.
"
30056,"Due to the weakness of governmental logic taken under control for the protection of the local people, the government can not be directly affected by the leader, not to arrest the leader.
"
30057,"Likewise, the right-handwriters, who give human rights activist to meet the barracks of prisoners, have to be practical confirmation.
"
30058,"In a letter to the 25-day commitment letter to the members of the Commission, the clear written notice will be given to the non-immunization notice.
"
30059,"Was it
"
30060,"However, the Commission could not get such access even when trying again.
"
30061,"Due to the principle of commitment committed in the royal declaration for democracy and human rights conservation, the country will not have to face the head of the international community head.
"
30062,"Rights activists are expected to strengthen the public by constitutional parties and intellectuals and media, where conditions can be done for peaceful peace.
"
30063,"Additional situation in the Geneva meeting will come to pass, the emerging country will be taken into consideration for further negative conditions.
"
30064,"Such a fortune is necessary to take appropriate steps to save the country.
"
30065,"Interesting tourists
"
30066,"The winter season is a major season of arrival when the cold weather is not ending.
"
30067,"Impact of conflict Lesson gradually, tourism arrivals are decreasing, the business from Hotel Trekking Business to Friya has become a panic.
"
30068,"Some have not got the return of their investment.
"
30069,"The danger of revolving by doing business by lending is increasing.
"
30070,"There is a disappointment in the country that peace and stability in the country can not be reached for the conflict resolution of the country.
"
30071,"The Tarahotel Palace is capital of about 90 percent of the rooms in this season.
"
30072,"There is a 15 percent increase in the cost of repair and maintenance of the employees of the room, the tourist business has been created.
"
30073,"How many cook waiters and medium-level employees are employed.
"
30074,"The situation outside the capital is more variable.
"
30075,"Tourists are zero in the famous Rolavalang area in the past.
"
30076,"Tourists are also zero in the famous Pyitra Marg, which has views of Gaurishankarankar Himal Charrollupa Himalal and Sagarmatha base infrastructure.
"
30077,"It is memorable that the Recent Adventure Agency XiPenPower has recently been ranked among the ten main chains that could be reached once in life.
"
30078,"Such tourist, which has special interest, is the condition of tourists zero on the path of the pilgrimage, and it is easy to guess that there is no better condition.
"
30079,"Attractions in hotel business in the Rolving area are not considered to be a pleasure to look forward to changing their profession.
"
30080,"Their desire to be abroad is seen after the shortfall of tourists in the near future.
"
30081,"A typical hotel also has a job of more than a dozen direct directives, and medium-sized businessmen are making hundreds of jobs.
"
30082,"Due to the situation of such migrants, tourism business is more likely to be in danger.
"
30083,"The situation is likely to be disadvantaged by the Lodge Restaurant and Trekking Agency.
"
30084,"Telephone and Internet businessmen have been hit directly.
"
30085,"If the production of farmers has not got proper market, domestic industries have become scarce.
"
30086,"Instant activation of the concerned body is necessary in the bullying control of a major industry in the country.
"
30087,"According to the target of Nepal Tourism Year 1998, almost one lakh tourists visited the country.
"
30088,"According to tourist practitioners, that speed was kept continuously, at that time, at least one million tourists would have come to the country.
"
30089,"For almost a decade and two, decades of conflict, Sri Lanka is running as a major tourist destination in India like Kashmir.
"
30090,"Tourism promotion agencies should have a special plan to set up such experience opportunities and to maintain the tourism business environment.
"
30091,"Growth from Zero
"
30092,"Sunsari's radicals have become the last example of personal rights that can be started on Monday and start rising from zero to zero.
"
30093,"They have been exhausted in short time, as they migrated from the house where the liquor could not be planted and settled in the Elani area.
"
30094,"Sunsari Tuthahaka's ten families were forced to escape from the village after no charge of alcohol was consumed for almost two years.
"
30095,"Their hands were empty when they were traveling to the Alani area, near Dohi Canal, a dozen kilometers from the village.
"
30096,"In the condition of spending and demanding an open sky, their hearts and minds have not only been brought to different things, they have modeled their heads.
"
30097,"They have taught their children the school.
"
30098,"Farmers have entered the stage of systematic life by earning farming and saving them in cooperative.
"
30099,"Publicity has been public due to the inhumation of people like a person's food from stirring iron on charges of alcohol.
"
30100,"In such rural areas there is such a problem as terrifying.
"
30101,"In such cases, the family is suffering from severe psychic pressure.
"
30102,"Not only the superstition of the booby but also the Chaurwa and Kamaiya tradition are being violated by human rights violations.
"
30103,"They are deprived of the individual freedoms guaranteed by the constitution of all countries.
"
30104,"Kaimiya is an example free example that the environment that can be used to consume independence can open the path of advancement.
"
30105,"Until the year 2057, thirty thousand Nepalis were employed as a labor worker.
"
30106,"Many of them who are free of movement are killed in a period of four years.
"
30107,"According to the people who are close to Kamaiya Mukti Movement, the progress made by a fourth-free Kayaiya is very encouraging.
"
30108,"At the time of democracy reinstatement, the number of social welfare continued to be strong.
"
30109,"Similarly, the awareness of communication sector and non-governmental organizations enjoyed biochemical activity.
"
30110,"To eliminate the superstition of alcoholism, soft work towards the widow can be considered to be the modern society, to run the local people especially in the wake of Jagaran campaigns.
"
30111,"Such efforts will be strengthened to create equality-oriented society.
"
30112,"Such efforts should be activated by non-governmental organizations and civil society to provide adequate support.
"
30113,"Dharmizi Hai as a health worker
"
30114,"Some remote operations have been proven effective in removing blind faith that Dharma Zodiac is a disease-related disease, like iron is iron.
"
30115,"District Development Committee has been transformed into some healthcare professionals due to general training given by non-governmental organizations working in the District Public Health Office or health sector.
"
30116,"This is certain to have a positive impact on the common health consciousness.
"
30117,"The elders who advise to feed juadigadi juice also give advice to bring the patient immediately to health.
"
30118,"The practice of worshiping a ghost or goddess that is known to be worshiped or worshiped at home is more widely available at home.
"
30119,"Many people who believe in traditional and superstitious faith believe in dangers than health.
"
30120,"In such cases, Dhami is often implicit in traditional style to say that it is healthy to go to health.
"
30121,"There is also another section of Jagran.
"
30122,"The origin of blind faith is conducting awareness of awareness.
"
30123,"Jagary of Gaighat Udaipur has left for a long time to shake off the knights and red or black bears to shine.
"
30124,"His mantra has also been replaced.
"
30125,"Due to lack of proper health information, its impact will be multi-dimensional in the society that loses life.
"
30126,"Dhamija Kri is not free of blind faith, even in the rural areas, not only educated urban areas.
"
30127,"Even in the houses of the urban elders, it can be heard very easily.
"
30128,"They advise their customers to go to the hospital and they are happy to spread their consciousness even if their income is reduced.
"
30129,"In reality it is their atonement.
"
30130,"It is equally similar to the training of students who have been trained in additional training.
"
30131,"After passing away, Pandit Purothy has also been involved in training in Gaighat.
"
30132,"In society, many people who are considered to hear from Pandit Purohit, listen to their role in health awakening.
"
30133,"Positive changes to normal health will ultimately help in making all the social socio-economic and educational indicators.
"
30134,"Unbelief behavior
"
30135,"Diabetes was informed that the king was imprisoned and politically imprisoned by political party leaders.
"
30136,"Such austerity behavior can also affect the efforts of political dialogue.
"
30137,"Depending on the behavior of the opposition, the evaluation of the character of the government is the revised standard of democracy.
"
30138,"The dignity of the state increases or decreases the behavior of political counterparts.
"
30139,"The state's image inside and outside the Dama country can not be considered as a non-discipline.
"
30140,"In the referendum that has been called by the King to bring a clear agenda to political party leaders, they should get the opportunity to build their perceptions.
"
30141,"Public interactions are not expected to be quite regular and easy-to-face decisions from their workers regularly and the leaders who are deprived of the newspaper.
"
30142,"Information is more important because ideas get shape based on information.
"
30143,"Nothing can be expected from the informal leadership.
"
30144,"In order to resolve the need for political dialogue in the country's problem, constitutional parties are not able to deny the procedure that can help the procedure.
"
30145,"Conservative behavior or unbelief and frustration increase or fear.
"
30146,"In both these cases, communication and agreement are impossible.
"
30147,"It is imperative that the country should talk to the stakeholders and to the direction of consensus.
"
30148,"The controversy in which the box is exposed to knowing that the parties themselves from the parties themselves are not uncomfortable.
"
30149,"To strengthen the opportunity of increasing communication by unbelief, do not respect the nation's will.
"
30150,"Observing leaders, workers are deprived of regular interpreter, so newspapers can be very helpful for building views.
"
30151,"In keeping in view the information issued by the National Media Government, following the instructions of the government, it is not justified by any means to keep the leaders in such a way.
"
30152,"Political crisis solution is not possible by placing or insulting political leadership.
"
30153,"The democratic structure is represented by the people in the state's state-run, and the open society.
"
30154,"Of course, the state has ruled out the crisis of crisis to control violence, but constitutional parties are not obstructed or not.
"
30155,"The state can not deal with terrorism and creative opposition.
"
30156,"Order to improve justice
"
30157,"Not to be law enforced and enforced is not unique in Nepal's context.
"
30158,"If so, how much of the law that is never used is so often discussed.
"
30159,"If the laws that do not behave in their respective justice are related to justice, then it also offers a glimpse of ignoring and ignoring.
"
30160,"It was an example of the Justice Fund.
"
30161,"The Supreme Court has given directive order to the government to implement that Act, which has remained unchanged for eight years.
"
30162,"It has been ordered in order to be law for various purposes, but the disease that can not be applied to its implementation.
"
30163,"According to the law, the amount of Rs. 50 crores has risen in different cases from the judiciary as the fund could not be formed.
"
30164,"The highest order has been ordered to take effective steps towards implementing the above law to stop this order.
"
30165,"This system has not been implemented by government depression.
"
30166,"Only after the publication of the government in the Gazette, this Act will be activated.
"
30167,"Such information has not been published yet.
"
30168,"It has stopped the fund formation process, has raised the question on the justification of the single law.
"
30169,"One part of the judiciary of the main three constituencies of the state does not have one percentage of national budget.
"
30170,"The lower budget has shaded the physical reforms of the court's manpower and management and other welfare schemes.
"
30171,"The judge itself himself has seen discontinuation.
"
30172,"This ultimately promotes judicial delay and corruption.
"
30173,"The Act has been constructed to prevent this situation and to be deposited in judicial funds in the court's development.
"
30174,"Unable to publish a notice in the Gazette, it is ironic that the entire law is made to make it invalid for eight years.
"
30175,"It has also been inaccessible to the development of single judiciary, which has made it worthless of the labor and expenditure of the law.
"
30176,"The amount of money spent on the construction of the country has become pre-national.
"
30177,"And the sequence is growing.
"
30178,"In this situation the order issued by the Supreme Court on Wednesday is appreciable.
"
30179,"The implementation of the most likely will be in the interest of the court.
"
30180,"It is also the responsibility of the government.
"
30181,"Making law for legal rule not only reaches, it should also be implemented correctly.
"
30182,"The government does not forget the reality.
"
30183,"People in public life
"
30184,"Using open environment after the reinstatement of democracy, most of the non-governmental organizations have kept increasing the awareness of the key issues on the matter.
"
30185,"Such organizations have encouraged the use of folk culture for awakening.
"
30186,"Similarly, the activities of consciousness by showing HIV AIDS influences have been shown effective by teaching Jammu and Kashmir to teach them to go to the hospital.
"
30187,"In the past, two folk folk songs have also been used as a means of mass awareness.
"
30188,"In particular, limited folk music has been widespread in rural areas for some years.
"
30189,"The use of dual fare is also increasing for commercial goods from dual restaurants folk folk competition.
"
30190,"Two songs of Caski against HIV AIDS have been cited as social consciousness.
"
30191,"Lok Sabha who started to cope with North India from Tibet, can have the potential to make immediate impact on the people.
"
30192,"Therefore government NGOs in social welfare are likely to use more folk folk music.
"
30193,"Established FM stations after democracy reinstatement became the main medium of folklore and dual propagation.
"
30194,"Just like such a tape and taxi, such songs began to sink public transportation.
"
30195,"Using the fact that the influence of public interest is widespread, the program can be predicted to be effective by programmable programs.
"
30196,"The urban area is comparatively compared to village sheep compared to information and education levels.
"
30197,"Message people need double programs so there is a lot more than the city.
"
30198,"Such programs will provide entertainment to the rural people, as long as the awakening message in their circles can be the effect of the message.
"
30199,"Due to the increase in open border conflict, there is a large group of workers working in India.
"
30200,"A number of of these HIV is estimated to be suffering from HIV.
"
30201,"Due to that, many rural women of remote villages have also been victims of deadly diseases.
"
30202,"Due to the unstable political situation in the country, when such issues are overwhelming, their impact may have been more dangerous than it has been estimated.
"
30203,"Miscellaneous reasons People can be double-handed through giving a unique message to a large group deprived of information.
"
30204,"That is why such a program needs to be headed by the city.
"
30205,"Campus Hathama Security
"
30206,"The students have to show their identity cards to the security personnel in the entrance gate of other educational institutions including central campus of Tribhuvan University.
"
30207,"Copybook will be dominated and communicated
"
30208,"Due to the uncomfortable presence of security personnel in education, the possibility of increasing conflict has increased.
"
30209,"Even in the Nirmar Panchayati regime, the university was not open to open security forces.
"
30210,"At the same time, a record record of dozens of incidents, including the efforts of the security personnel who entered the campus entrance gate or premises, must be protected.
"
30211,"Presence of armed groups at university campus is not common in any case.
"
30212,"This also makes the environment tense enough to influence the intensive dialogue and discussion between the teacher and the student.
"
30213,"The campus administration has a policy of preparing internal structure in the campus to prevent non-students from entering the entrance outside the security personnel.
"
30214,"The open structure of famous universities of developed countries can be learned from the educational body without control.
"
30215,"Student can not be calm down by pressure.
"
30216,"The impartiality of Independence Panchayat has not been able to prevent the student's activities from being stopped.
"
30217,"In Panchayat, the strong state mechanism was constantly defeated by the strong students of unity and program on the oppressed days on the students.
"
30218,"Exercise is not controlled in the neighboring universities of neighboring India.
"
30219,"It is natural to find someone who is studying in a campus to benefit from another library or other types of educational resources.
"
30220,"It helps to expand the knowledge of the student's knowledge.
"
30221,"It is self-sufficient fact that everyone in such university campus who runs out of tax exhaustion.
"
30222,"It is also a reference to the democratic system.
"
30223,"After the posting of a security guard outside the Campus student, the student opens openly to be a hesitant to exercise knowledge.
"
30224,"How many teachers can not live independently in such an environment?
"
30225,"This will ultimately impact the quality of education.
"
30226,"The control of present-day institutions seems to be contradictory when the educational institutions are also ready for fear and stress-keeping code of conduct.
"
30227,"The state's morale is a message when trying to control students who study campuses.
"
30228,"The founding party does not seem to be frightened with the target student carrying the pen copy.
"
30229,"As a member of the active member of the world community, educational institutions such as school campus, will be a vision of respecting world-class recognition of conflict stress and fear.
"
30230,"Shahi Sahitya Campus Hathama, the student's request to remove operational security personnel delayed taking seriously, may lead to unpleasant situations.
"
30231,"Two banks for aggressive investment
"
30232,"Despite the lack of resources, due to the problem of loan disadvantage, the investment of the National Commerce Bank and Nepal Bank Limited was slow for some years.
"
30233,"Now both the banks have started investing in consumer interest programs in competitive interest towards aggressive investment.
"
30234,"Targeting the middle class, both of these banks have taken over the program.
"
30235,"It is likely to easily ease the middle class that wants to build housing or buy a vehicle.
"
30236,"Although the consumer bank or finance company having a higher cost of Pu Ji, it is positive for the consumers, even if it is disadvantaged.
"
30237,"The bank has been investing in a treasury bills which are comparatively less than 3 percent of the wages.
"
30238,"Since the interest rates of consumers are higher than this, this will also benefit from the bank.
"
30239,"This announcement will push pressure on private sector commercial banks and financial institutions to reduce interest.
"
30240,"The consumer has been complaining about paying a higher interest rate for the commercial bank.
"
30241,"The majority of the commercial banks' average profit margin was no longer due to the disadvantages of these complaints.
"
30242,"The debt burden has not decreased because the total banking business was over 50 percent and the most deposited bank did not compete in the investment.
"
30243,"Now private sector financial institutions will also create a situation that will reduce interest rate by compulsion for competition.
"
30244,"The main area of ​​investment of the finance company is housing and high-patches.
"
30245,"Due to the cost of such Pu Ji's company, it will be difficult to compete in the bidder.
"
30246,"Due to higher interest rates, customers of the financing company may be bound to Commerce Bank.
"
30247,"Such companies may have to be competitive and find a new opportunity for investment.
"
30248,"This is a positive side of the bank's debt crisis to attract middle income loan consumers.
"
30249,"These banks in the reform process also needed to change the old work method.
"
30250,"By public public interest, these banks have taken positive pace and they are now trying to send a message that will be competitive.
"
30251,"It is necessary to increase the order further.
"
30252,"For this, competition programs must also be brought in other areas of investment.
"
30253,"There are also risks of consumer debt.
"
30254,"Without a hazardous and accurate analysis, such a debt can be caused by a problem.
"
30255,"The bank can pay a lot of stress and pressure on the bank.
"
30256,"When investing more in the same area, the bank may have a lack of resources for the better project in the future.
"
30257,"This can show the mature maturity of the bank.
"
30258,"Otherwise, the problem of uncomfortable will be repeated.
"
30259,"Annan's new offer
"
30260,"United Nations UN General Secretary Kofi Annan has mixed the reaction of the union after a change in the organization's structure.
"
30261,"The world organization, formed to save the world from conflict and warfare, has suffered both praise and criticism for 60 years.
"
30262,"Seeing like a polygon from a dozen polynomial conditions, all the world's countries have still been willing to work on this institution.
"
30263,"The United States, and the United States, has also shown its faith in the highest ground, including the United States.
"
30264,"Ananam said on Monday that the details of security of the Council and the main issues of mutual cooperation between poor and wealthy countries have been included.
"
30265,"His proposal to extend the 15-member current security council to 24 members, with permanent stability, has changed its proposal into the world's situation.
"
30266,"But that decision-making process is difficult.
"
30267,"Because the permanent members of the General Assembly with permanent members, it is possible to extend the security council only.
"
30268,"Annan has submitted two tier proposals with additional six permanent members or eight semi-permanent members.
"
30269,"Japan Germany has made public interest in becoming a permanent member of Brazil and India.
"
30270,"US Secretary-General Condoleezza Rice, who was on Monday in Japan's visit to Japan on Monday, expressed concern over the first proposal of the United States.
"
30271,"Experts have shown another significant offer of Annan as embroidery.
"
30272,"Ananan has given special emphasis on the financial assistance of the poor to make the poor nation reach the nation's Millennium Development Goal.
"
30273,"Therefore, poor demand for poor countries should give special importance to the rich interest of the country.
"
30274,"The main issue of both the help and giving of the human rights is not to be questioned.
"
30275,"Earlier in his journal, in a journal, he could not bring a special program for the poor, in the 21st Century, he expressed strong views on the future of the United Nations.
"
30276,"In particular, the opposition has criticized the opacity of things like diplomacy.
"
30277,"It has also been cultivated by a large number of working unbelievers, which is conservative and disabled.
"
30278,"Such generations of high-ranking people have been accused of being absconded by the new generation to perform effective work and display talent.
"
30279,"Annan has given special importance to the idea of ​​favoring all such aspects.
"
30280,"A hundred 9 1 member nation is the main institution in the fight against conflict and so on.
"
30281,"In the 18 countries of war-fought countries, the current ongoing peace process and the election of Afghanistan in 999 countries, including Palestine, also proves its supremacy.
"
30282,"Even in the conflict of Nepal, its cooperation has become like inevitable.
"
30283,"Especially the Arab countries have not been able to take an idea of ​​terrorism about terrorism.
"
30284,"In Sudan, who accused the US and its ethnic cleansing of the International Criminal Court, in the context of China's opposition to the intervention of the Security Council in the Sudan, it has been considered to be critically unfair.
"
30285,"Annan's report seems to be courageous for the first time in the 6-year history to offer a commodity change.
"
30286,"The implementation of the poor poor in both countries is actively enforced by this proposal and also the importance of the UN will increase.
"
30287,"Drinking water expansion decade
"
30288,"With the slogan of having drinking water, the United Nations will decide on the 2015 spring water for the 2015 year, after the decade 2015.
"
30289,"Currently, 83 percent of the world's population has only drinking water. 1 billion 10 million people have not received drinking water.
"
30290,"He is eating water from the insecure source like Anar river pokhari.
"
30291,"In Nepal, drinking water of more than half the population is not easy.
"
30292,"The total number of 55 million people from the country has not reached access to minimum drinking water during the next 10 years.
"
30293,"The first water was possible to bring more than one billion people to the drinking water during the period of 1981-1990.
"
30294,"Since the United Nations has made half the work work, the construction of a special water plan has torn up the member states.
"
30295,"Drinking water accessibility program was prioritized by the previous water that was affected by decades.
"
30296,"According to a statistics, there were less than 6 percent of drinking water facility in 2027.
"
30297,"According to the rapid expansion of the water plan by 3647 in the year 2047 and now half of the population has got drinking water.
"
30298,"We also work half the work.
"
30299,"On the accessibility of clean and quality water, the relevant body needs to make special programs.
"
30300,"The first water decade taught the lesson that the pipe cement and the structure are not only targeted by the community.
"
30301,"Attachment of community in the coming decade is considered as inevitable.
"
30302,"We are also told that the involvement of the community is increasing in water management.
"
30303,"In the urban areas, the management of water in the urban areas and villages is also mandatory for the management of water from the consumers.
"
30304,"After the policy is ready to invest 20 percent of the government and 80 percent of the government, hundreds of villagers have started making arrangements for water.
"
30305,"The cost of the project has decreased from 30 to 50 percent due to the gathering of self-sufficient laborers.
"
30306,"The continuity of the community continues to be sustained by the next ten years, the availability of drinking water is definitely sure.
"
30307,"The unavailability of drinking water is considered to be directly related to poverty and stress.
"
30308,"There is no plan to construct drinking water in many rural areas, there is a severe lack of water in the capital and in the urban areas.
"
30309,"Some stream of water does not get water, so many are found to have waste water.
"
30310,"Bridges of Nicolas, a nightbreaking curtain on a day of delicious water, have also become stressful to the victims.
"
30311,"Water access and quality both have a special program.
"
30312,"Another challenge is to save water resources from pollution.
"
30313,"The internal and external financial support of the water project is available within decades.
"
30314,"The direct engagement of the community has reduced experience and making it more effective.
"
30315,"Legal freedom question
"
30316,"The Judge of the Judge who is not a bad actor and a lack of functionality, is headed by the Chief Justice, the constitutional order to investigate and prosecute.
"
30317,"Is it
"
30318,"There is a different question about how much he has done in fourteen years constitutional practice.
"
30319,"But it is clear that during the period, the council became capable of taking strong action against the bad judge.
"
30320,"On the basis of higher officials, Guapuri Chapasi and Conservationism could not improve the image of judiciary.
"
30321,"The judge who decided to go beyond the law and the discretion also came under protection.
"
30322,"The Council itself does not have the right to raise the evidence of investigation against the judge, and the right to prosecute the corruption after the necessity is not the same.
"
30323,"The Constitutional Law Act and the Criminal Procedure Code have given sufficient authority for it.
"
30324,"Apart from this, the members of the High Court and the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court are the majority of the members of the member council.
"
30325,"If he wants, then corrupt judges can easily take action against law.
"
30326,"It is not unrealistic to increase the doubts of the council, even if it is the right to claim corruption in the same period even during the same period, not against one judge.
"
30327,"The commission started investigation on the judge, saying that the existence of the independent court is certainly connected.
"
30328,"Judicial freedom is a democratic system and a spirit of civil society.
"
30329,"There is a paradoxical principle that the executive or other person should be judged outside the control.
"
30330,"Therefore, the commission does not allow the proceedings to go beyond the principles of constitutional boundaries and power balance
"
30331,"Must be done.
"
30332,"Judges of the Supreme Court have expressed their objection to the work of the Commission, and suggested the judicial leadership to immediately call the Judicial Council.
"
30333,"They have also challenged the judiciary and the police to investigate the judge, saying that this situation is not going to be a judicial freedom.
"
30334,"The Nepal Bar Association also has emerged as a new challenge in judicial freedom.
"
30335,"No criminal will be punished.
"
30336,"But do not even take action outside the law.
"
30337,"This will allow chaos.
"
30338,"The crime of the judge is also not enough.
"
30339,"According to the same concept, the Constitution and the Law have given the right to investigate the bad conduct of the judge till the issue of corruption in corruption.
"
30340,"The responsibility of making it effective is of the Council, especially the Principal.
"
30341,"In the past, there is no controversy in the past that the council is unfair and unfamiliar with judicial corruption.
"
30342,"Now the Council can also take the opportunity to take an active role in the royal commission.
"
30343,"The lack of past weakness is also a serious message to avoid repeating.
"
30344,"The District Judge Karnarara, who is said to have been arrested for twenty thousand pieces, should also take legal action and action against the Council.
"
30345,"It is equally necessary for the commitment of the Principal and the Royal Commission to assist the Chief Justice on this matter of judicial dignity and dignity.
"
30346,"Cheat of taxi drivers
"
30347,"The taxi drivers in the urban area are constantly experiencing tension.
"
30348,"Those taxi meters are ruined.
"
30349,"The Government has failed to break the compulsion to pay more than the fixed rate.
"
30350,"Taxi is almost ten times expensive than ordinary means of public transportation Bus Temo Microbus.
"
30351,"By raising more money on it, consuming more money is consuming directly on the consumer.
"
30352,"The last one showed that 85 percent of the taxi's capital has been eradicated.
"
30353,"The number of thousands of consumers in the country is estimated to be broken by thousands of people in Kathmandu.
"
30354,"There are no mitters in Pokhara and other cities.
"
30355,"Thus thousands of ordinary people can not be considered capable of controlling it effectively.
"
30356,"Although the fraud of taxi in developed countries is a case of crime, it has not been effective for us to implement the law.
"
30357,"Complaining with the taxi driver, the travelers are forced to eat various threats and occasionally unnecessary abuse.
"
30358,"Why do not you get a taxi just to climb? My traveler is going to hear exactly what is going to be a fine money.
"
30359,"Taxi businessman drivers and vehicles need strong acne on riches to control such an inconvenience.
"
30360,"Generally, especially in a hurry, a cab for a while and occasionally, a taxi climbed for convenience.
"
30361,"Even if you are aware of the fact that you are ill and injured, you are not able to increase any action against the driver.
"
30362,"Even if the deceased have taken action against that, the results have not come positive.
"
30363,"Although the news is public on such irregularities, the concerned body has not been able to effectively manage the fraud.
"
30364,"The taxi longer than four decades has made public interest in the taxi business.
"
30365,"The quality of quality and measuring department of the meter is proving that the responsibility of control can not be taken.
"
30366,"There is also a charge that the department's employees will be the most irregularity in the mittal taxi.
"
30367,"The fraud has not been made to hear the complaint of the consumer who arrives in traffic.
"
30368,"There is a similar disadvantage in the cabbage on the airport.
"
30369,"He does not run the meter.
"
30370,"The syndicate here has been set up in a bad way.
"
30371,"The passengers who arrived at the rate of fixed rates should take taxi taxis.
"
30372,"Apart from the capital, it is also around the airport near Pokhara.
"
30373,"In this case, Quality Department should immediately review its failed mechanisms.
"
30374,"In addition to the work of the government in reviewing the involvement of the independent body, the solution of solutions can be found.
"
30375,"The government should use strict mechanisms to eradicate a worker or a peak, severely punishing.
"
30376,"A tough system of canceling the driver's license has already been necessary.
"
30377,"The state is responsible for eradication of everyday cyclists and to destroy the ongoing cyclone of guilt.
"
30378,"Kathmandu Lhasa road connection
"
30379,"The agreement between Nepalese and Chinese government officials Sunday has been formally approved by the Lhasa Direct Bus Contacts.
"
30380,"The preparation of a bus bus in the week can not increase many passengers, but it is successful if in the meantime road traffic will be made of a strong trader base.
"
30381,"Even though the new system is less, Chinese tourists will be able to adapt.
"
30382,"At the same time, at the same time, the flight to Kathmandu LAHA is considered to be one of the most expensive in the world.
"
30383,"The road will be given relief to passengers traveling around Rs. 28 thousand for an hour away.
"
30384,"According to the agreement, the Lakshasa buses of Kathmandu, a thousand kilometers long, have been fixed for about Rs.
"
30385,"The agreement on establishing direct bus connections of Kathmandu Lhasa will further strengthen Nepal's proximity to the Northern neighbor.
"
30386,"In comparison to one-hour air travel, the number of times the cheapest place of transportation is to increase the contact of public-level communication and to enhance business business.
"
30387,"Regarding direct land relations with two countries, for sure lands, it has a special significance.
"
30388,"Trade balance is not in favor of Nepal, but two-merchandise trade has already taken momentum.
"
30389,"The results have not been significant due to lack of realization of historic public relations, especially in the services sector.
"
30390,"There is a lot of opportunities available for immediate completion of many opportunities to benefit from China's economic growth.
"
30391,"China has become the most populous countries in the world in recent years
"
30392,"Is it
"
30393,"Burns go for more than one million and more Chinese goats.
"
30394,"The previous year, one million Chinese Tibet came from the mainland.
"
30395,"The number of tourists coming from China is also increasing.
"
30396,"Nepal is able to benefit from both tourists, when the reliable traffic system is established.
"
30397,"The Sunday deal has begun to hopefully capitalize this possibility.
"
30398,"It is positive to maintain direct contact with the second country.
"
30399,"Such road connections bring directly to tourism trade and other businesses, strengthen the public relations.
"
30400,"Strong people can help to reduce formal formalities among the countries.
"
30401,"The agreement between the two countries, which is the road connection between the two countries or the means of transportation, determines the future of various businesses.
"
30402,"Therefore, before compromising the road connectivity, potential probability of its potential use and comprehensive homework on the account of profit
"
30403,"Should be done
"
30404,"The agreement with China does not allow the Nepalese tourism business to have a negative impact.
"
30405,"Sharing traffic has transformed its traditional business style by allowing 35 Gateway Transport companies to operate buses in Tibet in their banners.
"
30406,"Because the profit loss will be of the company, it is a low-risk initiative for the share.
"
30407,"But in the tourism business, the new system has created some distortion.
"
30408,"According to tourists businessmen traveling from Jip or bus to the Tibet Tourism Board, the new arrangement will kill dozens of tourists businessmen in Turbobat.
"
30409,"The concerned body needs to be studied in that regard.
"
30410,"Address the refugees
"
30411,"The Bhutanese King Jiggongjiang Wangchuk has begun together with the new constitution regarding two parties' democracy.
"
30412,"On the basis of the initial voting, the political parties receiving the first democratic place are only the proposed provision to compete in the general election for the convention.
"
30413,"A powerful group of conservative ideas disagrees with the democratic system under the new constitution.
"
30414,"In the land of multilingual caste and religion, the majority of Buddhist speakers who speak Jankkha language have been given special importance.
"
30415,"Neglecting over 40 percent minorities over the new proposal has also been continued.
"
30416,"Therefore, democrat leaders in the exile have not seen the proposed constitution as a hope.
"
30417,"According to the amendment of citizenship, the citizens have been accused of being treated in seven categories and behaving inequalities.
"
30418,"Older citizenship laws can not be considered fair in the new system.
"
30419,"In order to achieve the goal of equality and justice-democratic democracy, Bhutan should be obliged to treat all citizens as soon as possible.
"
30420,"His practical use will make the country active and conscious.
"
30421,"The process of appointment of constitutional posts, including the most independent and the chief justice, is not democratic.
"
30422,"The draft drafted four years in collaboration with the Indian specialists has been created when the constitution is not represented by the representation of skilled sheep during the constitution.
"
30423,"The classification that the government has proposed to the person living in refugees in eastern Nepal has also proved Bhutanese.
"
30424,"Refugees being blocked due to Bhutan due to Bhutan's efforts to facilitate the return of the home will be easy in the international community.
"
30425,"Despite the point of view and dissatisfaction, the publicity of democracy can be considered as a proper determination of the Bhutanese Rajasthan.
"
30426,"The determination of the beginning of the reign of the people elected by the people is positive.
"
30427,"Although there is a place to compete between more than two parties, local activists can expect political activism.
"
30428,"It is welcome to give the political parties a political party as sovereignty and their representation.
"
30429,"The Bhutan will be able to maintain stability by implementing a bloodless successful democratic system by taking back one fourth of its citizens.
"
30430,"Dizzo and childbirth social stigma
"
30431,"It is also unbearable that the child suffered from having another baby born.
"
30432,"Shortly ago, women of Dokhuk village of Taplejung had become aware of their village phenomenon independently.
"
30433,"There was a lot of play in the transit of dowry than the boy and girl's couple got married in the marriage. The women group had started anti-dysfunctional campaigns.
"
30434,"After that, the woman who had been suffering due to dysfunction is not surprising that she did not get the accusations she received.
"
30435,"Sunita Shah of Bodheevar Saina had to die due to lack of motorcycles asking for dowry in Saptari.
"
30436,"Saptari not only newly married but also mother of three to four children is also suffering due to dying.
"
30437,"By having a home-made problem, dysfunctional practices have lured the sleep of many teenagers' parents.
"
30438,"Teens of dysfunctional terrains of most Terai areas are also going through a serious mental stress.
"
30439,"Social awakening is essential for the diagnostic of such problem, even the state-run intervention is necessary.
"
30440,"Especially Madhas is another problem as a child marriage.
"
30441,"An example of this is Rupandehi Deepakari Chaudhary.
"
30442,"At the age of 11, adults like a male born within a year of adultery with a male adult have to look for others to be punished.
"
30443,"According to the Nepal Human Development Report 2004, 40 percent of women are still estimated to be the firstborn born at the age of 15 to 19.
"
30444,"The level of Nepali women is not good compared to the world's women.
"
30445,"Matrimoniality is five hundred and fifty one in the world's highest in the world.
"
30446,"70% of women who are able to produce a child can have blood deficiency.
"
30447,"Even though seeing such improvements in the statistics, it is also necessary to discourage childbirth practices that are married in 10 12 years of age.
"
30448,"It can not be doubled that both dowry and childbirth are social stigma.
"
30449,"As education and awareness grow up, such practices must be removed automatically.
"
30450,"But it is also difficult to maintain the practice of mobilization among the people who have achieved higher education.
"
30451,"In his control, the first educated woman and men need to express both the desire and courage to marry a dude.
"
30452,"Civil society government and non-governmental organizations can also discourage such mischief.
"
30453,"Trade expansion effort
"
30454,"The Nepal-Pakistan Joint Economic Council meeting, which was the first time for almost a decade, has opened a new door to expand bilateral economic and trade relations.
"
30455,"During the changed world environment and globalization, the mutual relations between the two countries are weighed in economic and commercial scales.
"
30456,"There is also an example of financial interest in one's ideally divided countries, and apart from trade and investment extensions, there are examples of access.
"
30457,"No
"
30458,"Even today, the inter-regional trade is limited to 5% even after entering into the establishment of the establishment. It is shameful for SAARC.
"
30459,"But the Bilateral Free Trade Agreement of member states will definitely make the way of business growth.
"
30460,"Until now, India and Pakistan have already signed such agreement with Sri Lanka and are ready to compromise with Bangladesh.
"
30461,"There has also been a lot of commercial relations between Nepal and India.
"
30462,"In this context, the proposed free trade agreement between Nepal and Pakistan can be expected to add a new dimension in this direction.
"
30463,"The bilateral agreement could also have efficacy in the implementation of the SAARC Independent Business Zone Safa since 2006.
"
30464,"Because of the list of relevant items within the Safita structure, being prepared on a multilateral basis, it may contain items associated with the export sensitivity of some countries.
"
30465,"The relevant list prepared by SAARC experts, until the meeting of the CEO, has not been able to assure the export consolidation of each country.
"
30466,"This is the primary farming thing that has become more competitive with the country than Nepal.
"
30467,"This weakness in Safta can improve the bilateral free trade agreement.
"
30468,"In the free trade based on bilateral agreements, the provision of commodity items is certain to be generous than Safta.
"
30469,"Talking about the business growth of Pakistan, I do not forget to forget the geopolitical situation of two countries.
"
30470,"When the Indian land is in the middle of these two countries, the free trade agreement can not only provide a significant achievement unless the initiative is initiated.
"
30471,"In today's context, India and Pakistan are not able to economically do business.
"
30472,"It is also difficult to use Indian land for Nepal and Pakistan's trade.
"
30473,"Therefore, bilateral relations with Pakistan are mutual, but it is also appropriate to discuss it with India.
"
30474,"There is no need to go ahead for the trip to Banglang Banglang which connects Bangladesh with this issue in Tripoli.
"
30475,"This time the Joint Economic Council meeting is sitting there when Kisan's trade is in profit.
"
30476,"Last year, foreign exchange was exported to Rs 27 million in the financial year and import was Rs.10 million.
"
30477,"Last year, the customs clearance received by the Nepalese Chia Kantipur facility has increased.
"
30478,"This proves bilateral trade potential.
"
30479,"Similarly, available alamchi jutka items can also be avoided in large quantities.
"
30480,"It will be appropriate to initiate the initiative in this direction with the government starting the discussion of the Free Trade Agreement.
"
30481,"Expect to agree
"
30482,"The government has shown a sign of making political environment in the country, despite the delay of releasing Nepalese Congress leader Girija Prasad Koirala for two months.
"
30483,"After the release of the main opposition leader, the other leader does not mean that the worker stops.
"
30484,"All political prisoners can be released without consent without releasing it.
"
30485,"It will help to make the country some optimistic, as well as fulfill the political vacuum.
"
30486,"In the process of Maoist control, workers of the constitutional parties are not a cadres.
"
30487,"The disadvantages of the mainstream parties, which suffer more damage from the Maoists and their political opponents, have a great loss for the nation.
"
30488,"If the Maoists are to be politically elected by its activism, the royal Nepal Army will make the campaign more efficient for the insurgency by the people's organizations.
"
30489,"It is important that Nepalese political parties are ready to accept the liberation of the 51-year-old Koirala as a positive indication by a democratic Indigenous and foreign community.
"
30490,"Major parties have made peaceful demonstrations through movement.
"
30491,"The souls of the parties are massacre, which can be taken into national issues as creative energy.
"
30492,"Political counterparts may have the power to direct any government to operate.
"
30493,"Koirala has urged the media to communicate with the King in protesting the issue of release of fundamental freedoms and the restoration of fundamental rights in the country.
"
30494,"When the Maoists are gathered together, his expression of bankruptcy is seen in favor of the monopoly of democracy and democracy.
"
30495,"He also pointed out that all political parties who came out of Nepal should come back and give national dignity.
"
30496,"Earlier, Deewala also said that the efforts of bringing democracy and democracy together would not be reduced.
"

30669,"The people have started saying that after the heat erupted, the cubic cubes and the coadows of Kodalo also turn off the motorway road.
"
30670,"Sandupalchowk Bhotechchaur resident is presenting its model.
"
30671,"They are taking the road in the new vadas of VDC.
"
30672,"Bhottachaurs have begun on construction of roads for three months.
"
30673,"The campaign has not yet been completed.
"
30674,"Their collective statement said that the road should be reached in every settlement and field.
"
30675,"So, Dhadanand Sapotoota, 71, has been around to make a road for about a month.
"
30676,"But do not give them any alkalinity.
"
30677,"The elderly Khandandand who has been waiting for a sweater, if there is a direct response to this, then I am ready to do so much more.
"
30678,"How many government officials say that the development of the village where they live, what they are doing is added.
"
30679,"It's not just a stand-alone but every gown that's going to go to this campaign is now included.
"
30680,"There is no one in the village where there is no labor force to reach the road.
"
30681,"Those who do not make roads should pay Rs. 300 a day, but that situation has not come.
"
30682,"In the past, residents of Sindhukkot neighborhood of VDC, made the Vinabajet's big rock and made similar roads.
"
30683,"That too became more inspiration for Bhatechaursauri.
"
30684,"They are not only new to the cow
"
30685,"Old roads have also been repaired and used to drive.
"
30686,"This campaign can now be a development message for other people.
"
30687,"If so, the construction of the road in public participation does not seem so much to reach the village.
"
30688,"Development plans will be successful in the same way.
"
30689,"Apart from the main road, Gaue has made up to 20 kms of auxiliary routes in the village.
"
30690,"If the government budget has made roads, more than one million has already been done.
"
30691,"From this, the government should also learn a quick lesson to develop the development plan that it is not only spending money by spending money.
"
30692,"They have made the importance of public participation more important for development.
"
30693,"Some people have also cut the wheat grains which have been planted to make roads, and the land has been vacated.
"
30694,"The street is rotated around the town.
"
30695,"There is no contradiction between them.
"
30696,"They have a collective desire to reach the road to the settlement.
"
30697,"Keeping the farm in the field of food is the first stop.
"
30698,"The desire to build roads in Bhotechaur and nearby village is historic.
"
30699,"033 In the 34 years, the residents of Bhak were suffering similarly to bring the road to the village.
"
30700,"The villagers remember to stay 13 km road on the outskirts of the capital, leaving the house along with Sutasamal and remembered that the worker Deep Bahadur Roymajhi of the time.
"
30701,"Seeing the involvement of the people, immediately the government had made money to make the road.
"
30702,"The main road connecting capital has reached facility to half a dozen VDCs.
"
30703,"The same engine has started coming from the capital for a decade from the capital.
"
30704,"Although the gaule is still crying to drive traffic on this road.
"
30705,"It has been a long time since they have traditionally been going to home to repair old roads.
"
30706,"It is not just satisfied with the main road, which is connected to Melamchi.
"
30707,"They want to make roads in the settlement to make a sustainable means for selling agricultural produce.
"
30708,"Due to which the freight will be easier, the income will also increase.
"
30709,"Famed as Western Naka in the district, Bhottachore and surrounding area of ​​the paddy wheat milk is considered to be famous for potatoes.
"
30710,"Due to this, rice has become a meal of Rs.
"
30711,"It is considered to be the food store of the district.
"
30712,"Of course the road will change its lifestyle.
"
30713,"So there is also a tracking route of Hamilu area of ​​Bhatechaur.
"
30714,"Lapidorjarga and Jugal Himal similar to a newly developed tea plant, and this Nagagali road can attract the mind of the tourists.
"
30715,"So there is a possibility of a tourist destination near Bhopechore.
"
30716,"If government assistance is added to this campaign, there will definitely be more energy.
"
30717,"A non-start-up plan can get stability.

"
30721,"If only a sun is brought only to the day, no sun starts a new era.
"
30722,"Here, in the seven years a sun, which took one day, started a new era.
"
30723,"The brightness of the same consciousness has been started by the fall of Nepal and the change of gold has started and the seven-year democratic era has begun.
"
30724,"After democracy, the whole massacre enveloped the cold sunlight of education and became very keen to educate the democratic age.
"
30725,"According to the aspiration of the nation and the necessity, education was not enough.
"
30726,"Tribhuvan University, established in the capital, was unable to fulfill the demand for increasing the day.
"
30727,"And the concept of multi-colleges came and the foundation of this university was established shortly.
"
30728,"And I imagine that in a peaceful and peaceful natural environment, student students will be devoted to their knowledge in the near future of bright people.
"
30729,"And from here, by going through this highway the highway will enter the highway of life.
"
30730,"At this time, what is happening to me, here is a big hand to bring this university to this state and to set up a vast forestry.
"
30731,"Because it is Nepal's leading zone in the agriculture and industry and its people are also prosperous and prosperous.
"
30732,"It is also the home of the suburbs of religious scholars and world-class scholars.
"
30733,"It is already the perception of the enlightened people that all the subjects are centered only in the capital, which we can reach in the capital of the capital.
"
30734,"Now the University of Punjab has arrived.
"
30735,"I am absolutely convinced that all the residents of this state will continue to receive support.
"
30736,"Without developing education, the development of the country is not possible and development of education without developing the country is also possible.
"
30737,"Both of these subjects are interconnected.
"
30738,"The countries that have reached the peak of advancement today have come from education and science.
"
30739,"In addition to other areas, science and technology are being developed even more.
"
30740,"We imagine that we should rain ten years of growth, which can not rain hundreds of others, but the Goof can not get any fruit.
"
30741,"It is understood by the University of Pennsylvania.
"
30742,"Therefore, it seems more focused on the science of technology and service related topics.
"
30743,"It is not that its actor is ignored by the knowledge and philosophy of other virtuous and diverse subjects.
"
30744,"And our universities in the country should be the center of research on some subjects.
"
30745,"It's a century to be a new world.
"
30746,"Now the pluralist tendency is becoming stronger by solving a single tendency.
"
30747,"Now the small ones are black.

"
30753,"If we depend on the information we import from other sources, our consciousness will not be blamed.

"
30833,"Half of Nepal's population is poverty-resistant.
"
30834,"The Tenth Five Year Plan has targeted the target of more than 38 percent of poverty among the people living in poverty.
"
30835,"The development of human resources in the scheme has made thinking of achieving goals through empowerment and targeted programs.
"
30836,"Similarly, community forest is given priority for poverty reduction.
"
30837,"Forest Science Institute for the purpose of producing essential human resources for forest development can contribute to poverty reduction by providing quality education.
"
30838,"Establishment to establish medium-level manpower, the institution has to be very successful in taking the degree of student degree in the forest.
"
30839,"In the lower literacy and increasing unemployment, there is a great role in creating jobs for quality technical education.
"
30840,"If the technical education is not merely quality but also a certificate, then the country should reconsider the investment.
"
30841,"Quality education is required for quality education.
"
30842,"Although the institution has been able to increase its programs, it has not been successful to create an educational environment.
"
30843,"In such situations, the level of education provided by this institution is considered to be administered as a rich man in human manpower and physical resources.
"
30844,"The institute has started showing an example of model models in the country and it has started raising questions on the educational quality provided by it today.
"
30845,"It is an example to increase the tendency to get a better score by studying students than to read students.
"
30846,"Education institutions are not only knowledgeable but also to learn ethical education.
"
30847,"But the institute seems to have increased the number of instincts in the institution of psychological work in the institution which is immoral.
"
30848,"Good governance is needed today.
"
30849,"It should be noted that the example of good governance should be presented from the point of view of the scientific work, but in the opposite direction the work is being done in the institution.
"
30850,"The university is considered to be the largest body of educational institutions of the Institute of Education and it is applied to the Institute after its approval from the Council of Statistics.
"
30851,"But the organization does not have any work in it.
"
30852,"The students provide discrepancy for the education of community forest, but the Institute has called for a certificate for the students in the Forest Forest.
"
30853,"To inform the officials of Tribhuvan University repeatedly to end such disorder, he did not take much interest in resolving it.
"
30854,"Trinity has not given much importance to the institution already.
"
30855,"Because this institution is smaller than the student's number than others.
"
30856,"Trivia is always focused on the number of student numbers, not much investment or possibility of development.
"
30857,"Similarly, unless the educational institute remains closed, Trivi has not been able to implement the good suggestions given by others except the concerned officer.
"
30858,"The Nepalese region has occupied 39 percent of the land parts of Nepal.
"
30859,"In order to develop and manage its government, the government has taken community forest ahead of the main program.
"
30860,"So far, the government has set more than one million hectares of forest and formed more than 13,000 community forest consumer groups.
"
30861,"As per the total population of 35% of the total population.
"
30862,"According to the investment, the Institute is considered to be big in the country.
"
30863,"The return of investment has not been received.
"
30864,"Good governance requires that.
"
30865,"Trivial is multi-dimensional and administrative is very large, which is not even able to get the feeling of good governance.
"
30866,"Due to the effect of employee and political influence, Trivia is not able to implement its judgment.
"
30867,"The study institutions, which are likely to develop, are also in danger.
"
30868,"The forest resources institution is the main weakness of the resources and resources that can not be operated properly.
"
30869,"Various work for Agriculture Forest University has been seen from 052.
"
30870,"In the 10th convention of the parliament, the Bill also agreed to establish a university.
"
30871,"However, the dispute of the proposed university was not able to advance.
"
30872,"Recently, the government had again formed a workforce to establish this university.
"
30873,"It has been reported.
"
30874,"It seems to be a major change, not just the general manipulation to remove the current deformation of the institution
"
30875,"It is not possible from the triangle.
"
30876,"If the University is established, there is more likely to be a comparative way of development in the Forest Science Institute.
"
30877,"By comparison, its administrative side is expected to be good.
"
30878,"This is smaller by admin.
"
30879,"It looks more likely that monitoring and evaluation system is made to make the system of good governance.
"
30880,"On the basis of the old experience, the new university can be changed and administered effectively by administering the administration.
"
30881,"And by providing quality education, the institute should first step forward.
"
30882,"Agricultural Forest University has made more assistance to complete this role.

"
30886,"Similarly, the book's Kacheer Library has already been from the Ministry of Finance 026.
"
30887,"Some years, Kalyani Regmi Memorial Library of private sector has come down as the ministry, but some of the national level libraries are aware of it.
"
30888,"Or if they keep the information, they are doing the same as well as the administration inside the ministry.
"
30889,"It is known that after coming in at the end of the school, there is often a dialogue between the Ministry of Education at Keshmahal's mall.
"
30890,"That's why the secretary spokesperson or some of the people should call from the cabinets.
"
30891,"Otherwise, it is always difficult to enter the carpenter.

"
30895,"Buying a book was Rs 1.5 lakh.
"
30896,"How coincidence is that every two libraries are available every day in the library.
"
30897,"That is the number of daily and weekly readers.
"
30898,"In this case, Wave Page's imagination is unique in itself.
"
30899,"Only six hundred in the Keshar library, such handwritten works are available.
"
30900,"Neither the political purpose nor the search of profit is found in their experience, even the library has not reached the reader in the right sense.
"
30901,"Even if there is a government mechanism, the library should have some autonomy to look after the Keshar Library.
"
30902,"Because because here is a government mechanism called a staff of the National Library in Harihar Bhavan.
"
30903,"The Ministry of mechanism has not been able to go to the UNESCO living in the upper corner of the same carmohan, to organize its old heritage.
"
30904,"The story of the National Library in Hirahar Bhavan is equally unique.
"
30905,"According to the Dasharth Thapa of the library, there are 84 thousand books, but the daily reader number is also expected to reach one hundred.
"
30906,"Thapa says we are in a hurry to go online.
"
30907,"The tune of these libraries, which is globalized, is illustrated by local influence, without local influence.
"
30908,"He said, ""It is 15 years old,"" said Thapa, but he did not know much about the library.
"
30909,"Although the concept of the National Library starts to be half-century, it is auspicious to not even get this Act.
"
30910,"Such laws to store all the books coming out of the country are valid in other countries.
"
30911,"The libraries are also voluntarily running.
"
30912,"How many libraries in Nepal are the status of their status?
"
30913,"Public consciousness has not been too late to open the library, whether it is okay to open it.
"
30914,"The library is null in itself for running at 10:00 PM in the office of government office and similar public holiday rights.
"
30915,"The library of Hariharbhavan, instead of a child's library, is run on Saturday, but the Keshar library is on display in the official language.
"
30916,"Thinking about spreading publicity and information mechanism, thinking about reaching to a community can be readily readily available.
"
30917,"We do not know why the idea of ​​organizing the library in the year of this year, does not know its ignorance, says the author of the Kishar library, says Brittany.
"

"
30960,"The publishers scandalize pupils' hands in their hands.
"
30961,"The mentality that improves the textbooks that does not have regular routine in the classroom, but the examination needs to be passed.
"

30972,"In order to increase the number of candidates in the examination, the certificate will not be helpful, but it does not help to get rid of the study.

30974,"Increasing dependence on this should control the flood while being absorbed by the educational level.
"
30975,"The opportunity to get hurt in such a way does not hurt us.

"
30986,"Due to short-term names and lots of money can be earned, many young people have attracted modeling.
"
30987,"But the number of modeling and definitive meaning and parameters of those who do not know, has changed the modeling area of ​​Nepal.
"
30988,"As a result, the tradition has been set to compete as a contestant who can pay more money to the organizer and sell a lot of event tickets.
"
30989,"Even though the modeling area is moving around in the environment of Nepal, it is time to discuss economic and sexual abuse.
"
30990,"Although some established models have been using it as a good business.
"
30991,"However, the problem of many heads is financial exploitation.
"
30992,"In the new entrepreneurs, the economic exploitation programs show that most of the entrepreneurs were killed by financial exploitation.
"
30993,"According to this, an artist said that the sponsor or producer had given money according to the agreement, even if the organizers scam among them.
"
30994,"He says - ""like us have established a new model which is misled - New generations are suffering from many models of economic exploitation.
"
30995,"' Although the models worked through the established agency have not hit such financial exploitation.
"
30996,"Director Jain Subba told the management of the ramp, who had not yet been able to hit any kind of economic emotions.
"
30997,"But it has experienced that economic exploitation will be found at 90 percent of those who are in contact with people.
"
30998,"Subsequently, the subdivision of the modeling area, which has been trained from the organization called The Ramp, has also killed financial exploitation in the initial phase.
"
30999,"Similarly, Thamson Nepal, which is making models available to the producers and using advertisements to make advertisements, is said to coordinate with the Modeling Training Agency for Models.
"
31000,"' So, even those who spend their own money to enter this area are also very expensive.
"
31001,"Instead of taking remuneration for some of the modeling, some have given the choreographer the same money.
"
31002,"They have only said that they have spent their own money in order to come to the media.
"
31003,"There are also many organizers and choreographers who are absconding money from the sponsor without the program at the other side.
"
31004,"There are many instances of ticket buyer and program attendants for the event, where all the organizers are missing.
"
31005,"Due to this, it has also been misleading to collect tickets for the entertainment.
"
31006,"Modeling career has been planted in Nepal with the development of Nepalese Modeling and Television while moving towards professionalism.
"
31007,"However, the profession of modeling that is going to be flourished through these means has not been developed in that proportion.
"
31008,"Although Nepali modeling area with disadvantages and discrepancies is moving ahead with the potential of the first.
"
31009,"In 15 years, there was only one show show throughout the year.
"
31010,"Competition is too large sum of money 'charm' was.
"
31011,"The capable person only had to participate in the competition.
"
31012,"So its educated and quality models were only in this area.
"
31013,"When Nepal was broadcasting the latest television, Nepali model was used to keep Indian models and dubbing in Nepal.
"
31014,"Now that the demand of this dubing is decreasing, even after the establishment of Nepal Television, the area of ​​modeling can be considered something developed.
"
31015,"But compared to the external countries, the modeling area of ​​Nepal should be considered to be moving shortly.
"
31016,"In the neighboring country, only modeling business in India has been running for 60 years.
"
31017,"There are also those who do not believe the area of ​​Nepalese Modeling which is going on.
"
31018,"Therefore, there is an idea of ​​arts that have not been able to achieve professionalism.
"
31019,"'The number of viewers viewing in comparison to listener is more naturally natural.
"
31020,"So not only on advertisements but in every type of song the demand for models is increasing rapidly and it has brought new possibilities.
"
31021,"She has been coming to the TV Modeling for past 6 years, and says that Rama Upriyati is busy busy.
"
31022,"The last time the development of the music video, the ones it is legitimate, is IGP.
"
31023,"People who are engaged in TV modeling are very busy now , because pops , modern , folklore and all the surgeons increase the order of music videos.
"
31024,"More specifically, old age models are mounted on a crowd of young people.
"
31025,"Models in the world's riches also have names.
"
31026,"The only example of India is to see if the billions of rupees have been made for a modeling.
"
31027,"India's famous hero Amitabh Bachchan had taken more than 25 million Indian rupees for a brand.
"
31028,"Similarly, the Indian Bollywood film actor active - nayikaharule a vijnapanakolagi 15 to 50 million Indians who are taking, money.
"
31029,"Because of the movie, short work can be made very little in the short run due to the increase in attraction.
"
31030,"However, in Nepal, an advertisement has been charged about Rs. 5 thousand for Rs. 50 thousand.
"
31031,"But if the modeling business of Nepal is a capital, it is worth mentioning that it takes 50 thousand rupees.
"
31032,"The exact figure of the number of modals in numerical view is not with any body or person.
"
31033,"Most experts in this area estimate that there are about 500 models in Nepal and women in Nepal.
"
31034,"And , in this proportion the choreographer has already been produced.
"
31035,"This growth with numerical approach is encouraging.
"
31036,"However, in the same proportion, quality manpower is deteriorating.
"
31037,"As a part of the modeling, fashion shows in the city's hallmarks and stars, and tournaments are often occurring in various titles.
"
31038,"Regardless of most of the such events being held in each week, most of the competitions have not been able to make any sense.
"
31039,"Because the ticket has already been a tradition of winning competitions that can sell more tickets and give the organizer money.
"
31040,"So modeling has led to unhealthy professionalism and its cost and recognition work is coming from those who are in it.
"
31041,"Not all Nepalese models are likely to adopt professionalism.
"
31042,"Models without any criteria are selected for unhealthy professionalism.
"
31043,"So far, 60 more ""show"" of the project had to choose a standard model by not recognize the high Madan.
"
31044,"According to Nepal's climate, he has taken it as a model.
"
31045,"' But TV-based advertising does not limit the age of modals.
"
31046,"There can be modeling from older children even if there is some criteria with age for the ramp.
"
31047,"Choreographer Jain Subba says - "" Being a model , education , self-confidence , physical beauty and discipline is essential in the bureaucracy .
"
31048,"Ramp modal and fashion shows also require a certain height.
"
31049,"' But most of these are not seen in Modeling in Nepal , which have become a problem with business models in this area.
"
31050,"Another modal arts are said to be Subba - 'The entry of people of unorganized and disable area has caused problems in the modeling area.
"
31051,"The restaurant's restaurants are now modeled for the only purpose to sell tickets.
"
31052,"The restaurant's customers are changing because it's easy to sell tickets.
"
31053,"He argued that such organizers could not sell tickets because of the dance dance girls.
"
31054,"But do not want to speak anything about Dance's restaurant's personal life and career.
"
31055,"Most models look more liberal in sexual activity.
"
31056,"Therefore, this area has been much more than that of the people who take this area as a disorder in Nepali society.
"
31057,"Most of the children who are in modeling in Madan Pradhan, who have organized more than 60 programs , should say sex , smoke and drink.
"
31058,"The boys are more lazy than they are compared to boys too.
"
31059,"Teachers are inside the modeling area that new entrepreneurs must have to steal alcohol and alcohol.
"
31060,"Adds to the head - ' Young people engaged in it are smoking , alcohol , and easily reaching sex.
"
31061,"""But the main victory manoranjana Shakya of Nepal Television channel alcohol, cigarettes and sex little distortion modeling area - only a little handsomely.
"
31062,"' Modeling is like a smoking drunk.
"
31063,"Children may not be able to cure cigarettes and alcohol during pregnancy.
"
31064,"Sex is equally different in other areas.
"
31065,"Although all the sex needs the sex, the Nepali society should be bound to the extent set by the Nepali society.
"
31066,"In public places women and men work hard or do not say that healing modeling is necessary only by every field.
"
31067,"The offer is not unusual for sexual interactions between the children associated with their age.
"
31068,"But in the modeling area, those who are older than the age of choreographer, they are abundant.
"
31069,"Choreographer Madan Pradhan also had sexual offers from many girls who were in modeling.
"
31070,"He says - ' But yet I did not accept one's request.
"
31071,"""While walking down the street girls walking hand in hand, even if he saw the bad outlook assume that 'it is actually not' say.
"
31072,"Practice of some model girls from New Delhi, who have taken photosense and choreographer for half a dozen programs have been suffering.
"
31073,"""Most of the girls have to show such behavior, he said.
"
31074,"In his opinion, due to such activity, the modeling field has been abusive.
"
31075,"But choreographer and modal arts do not like to spoil the alcohol and drink of cigarettes.
"
31076,"She quotes - ' Alcohol and smoking are also a group of doctors , do not you think it is disordered ?
"
31077,"""The personal interest and his private life is not appropriate to compare modeling pesasanga is stopped.
"
31078,"Therefore, even in discipline, people of this area have been accused of being very weak.
"
31079,"It is also a bad thing to do a commercial display in the uncontrolled region if it is normal to appear in the swimming pool on the swimming pool.
"
31080,"Such a bold way, the body of the body performers also tells Jain Subba.
"
31081,"Although small and thin clothes are also displayed in Nepalese musical and movie areas.
"
31082,"Some organizers push girls to wear internal organs on thin and electronic light.
"
31083,"In the developed countries, the organizational component of the country has not been shown.
"
31084,"In general, if the outer cloth is uninterrupted, even if the light is mixed, the outer cloth is covered with the outer cloth.
"
31085,"The photographer evaluates the best girls of the new girls as exploitation.
"
31086,"Some have liked sexual abuse as a problem seen in the modeling sector.
"
31087,"A choreographer says in a condition that does not mention the ninth - ""The choreographer who is also holding the title together with 48 hours for the model is also within the same area.
"
31088,"""All the girls in the contest, the title does not know he could not find the title tarkaagadi moving, often accused of sexual exploitation, he said.
"
31089,"But Jain does not believe in modeling in modeling.
"
31090,"'The models themselves are guilty.
"
31091,"Since sexual activity is open, this problem does not arise if women who are interested in it will be aware of themselves.
"
31092,"Similarly, the art is not even killed by sexual abuse.
"
31093,"But modeling is not only different - different in every area of man because it suggests that women have both to be aware of yourself.
"
31094,"For any information, people prefer to hear more than they read.
"
31095,"The same number of people who want to hear and listen at the same time is very high for the number of people who want to listen.
"
31096,"This is influenced by human interest, while most companies have made public through modes when they bring their new product to market.
"
31097,"The producers use modeling medium for the purpose of attracting more and more consumers to their products.
"
31098,"Similarly, the fashion has been shown through the modals for advertising advertisements.
"
31099,"Modeling is an art and its response comes instantly.
"
31100,"So it will be diligent and can evaluate itself if it is self-assessed.
"
31101,"The number of diligent and professional models in Nepal's perspective is only four dozen.

"
31586,"Women and men have a similar proportion of the living bodies for teaching.

31589,"This body is gradually being transformed into various systems teaching.

31614,"The dead body of an accident in the accident can not be used for teaching.
"
31615,"But in the good condition, the unarmed body is easily facilitating the demand of about 1 dozen medical colleges in Nepal.
"
31616,"After the death, human beings have become study materials for students who are a doctor who will be a doctor.
"
31617,"But during the political movement of 2036, the student refused to study without the dead.
"
31618,"After the students put positions in the demand for anatomy study among the demands laid down during the strike, campus management took the body of human beings from India . Ramchayaman gave responsibility to the Amatya.
"
31619,"He also took a recommendation from the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, and reached the Sri Krishna Medical College in Amrit Vihar Pant in Muzaffarpur.

"
31623,"But after returning from Nepal there was no vehicle to come to Nepal, the vehicle of Kathmandu's World Health Organization was arranged.
"
31624,"In the pickup vans provided by the organization, those boxes were brought to the Birgunj customs.
"
31625,"The customs authorities should return the box after refusing to leave the box on the basis of paperwork.
"
31626,"But the people who brought Nepal from Nepal, spread all over Nepal's palace.
"
31627,"Due to which the Memna Hotel of Birgunj did not allow a car with a las.
"
31628,"Afterwards, a vehicle was placed in Birgunj Regional Hospital.
"
31629,"Thus the demand for the student was completed from India, and the study was conducted smoothly.
"
31630,"Then there was also a provision of embalbling to Las in the teaching hospital.
"
31631,"It could be protected from lazy , nourishment and nausea.

31640,"One day, while working on Rambakkaji dedicated to the awareness of cure of awareness, a sudden chest came heavily and the biscon grew up.
"
31641,"The head died immediately after he reached the Memorial Hospital , Banepa.
"
31642,"The disease imploded it so that the doctors did not get time to treat.
"
31643,"After understanding, I later realized that he was suffering from high blood pressure over the years.
"
31644,"7 - 8 years to integrate into regular contact with the pressure never gave me the desire to show it jancaune and treatment advice.
"
31645,"I do not even know that he is a high blood pressure.
"
31646,"Perhaps there may be no signs and symptoms, but may have been not aware of the treatment even due to high blood pressure.
"
31647,"When blood pressure increased achecale, he did not get treatment.
"
31648,"The disease was pushed into the mouth of a single once not knowing him.
"
31649,"It is presented here as a warning to many of the sad deaths.
"
31650,"Hypertension is a good murderer of this era, namely ' Silent Killer ' .
"
31651,"It does not leave the patient quietly to death.
"
31652,"Therefore, the name of the Silent Killer is not the same.
"
31653,"I would also like to mention the construction of one of the other social activists here.
"
31654,"DR . My introduction to Mukunda Bahadur Shrestha, about 10 years ago , was conducted in the operation of a Muttugu test camp in Patna , Sundara.
"
31655,"He was the organizer of the health camp.

31656,"I went to the doctor as well.
"
31657,"Health camp jancisakepachi All I mukundajilai ' reform programs do you have high blood pressure jancaum ' said.
"
31658,"He did not let himself know that he was not a teacher.
"
31659,"I ' chief organizer of the importance of the continued najancne if a health camp and 1 ' that I shall request.
"
31660,"Then he accepted to sit in the patient's chair.
"
31661,"I asked - 'Is it a problem ?
"
31662,""" He said no problem at all.
"
31663,"I check in his blood pressure , 170 , 110 min . Min . It was Mercury.
"
31664,"Mukundaji was surprised.
"
31665,"He did not believe
"
31666,"I repeatedly measured the blood pressure in both the hands.
"
31667,"That's exactly the same.
"
31668,"I reminded him - ' Mukundaji Yu blood
"
31669,"4 areas that attack high blood pressure : brain , heart , nausea and kidney.
"
31670,"It is similar to the pressure , even if it increases, it does not know , it is not known.
"
31671,"So it bends many.
"
31672,"' Oh yes .. 1 shouted the mud.
"
31673,"I should test them blood , pistachio , ECG and advise them to start eating instant medicines.
"
31674,"He made all the tests in 1 - 2 days.
"
31675,"Both of them were diagnosed with the blood tester due to blood pressure.
"
31676,"He had seen symptoms of kidney failure in blood.
"
31677,"I immediately called him a kidney disease doctor . Rishikumar Kaflek was sent for treatment.
"
31678,"The kidneys have not been able to save.
"
31679,"The chando kidney could have been implanted as soon as possible.
"
31680,"In addition to the doctor's advice, he also went to Madras and implanted the kidneys.
"
31681,"About 5 years later, Miguel, who was replaced, also stopped working, and he died.
"
31682,"His death was due to high blood pressure , which made Kidney failure.
"
31683,"Even here, high blood pressure played the role of ' Silent Killer ' .
"
31684,"Do not know quietly ( showing no physical symptoms ) kidneys are not functional, and the patient is pushed to death.
"
31685,"These events I mentioned are realistic , I have experienced tropical experiences.
"
31686,"Self . Ramvakash Koch Shrestha and Self . DR . Mukunda Prasad Shrestha was my true friends.
"
31687,"They both were dedicated to the welfare of public awareness against cure.
"
31688,"Do not play games with high blood pressure , because it's a silent killer .
"
31689,"If not treated at the time, it quietly pushes the patient into the mouth of death.
"
31690,"No blood pressure will be delayed in the treatment of hypertension.
"
31691,"Hypertension may not have any symptoms of disease.
"
31692,"It may have been late for the symptoms to appear.
"
31693,"High blood pressure is a great health problem of this era.

31694,"With the rise of industrialization , urbanization and social , economic development , this disease is also increasing.
"
31695,"In most cases, this disease is the result of mental illness and modern change in modern civilization and the change in lifestyles.
"
31696,"Hypertension is a dangerous disease.
"
31697,"This disease is increasing everyday in Nepal.
"
31698,"Approximately 30 percent of the adult population ( above 18 years ) has seen high blood pressure in Kathmandu Valley .
"
31699,"That is why the hypertension is called ' silent killer ' .
"
31700,"Heart is an important part of the body , which regularly stirs and fills.
"
31701,"We call it heartbeat.
"
31702,"The heart acts as a pump for blood circulation.
"
31703,"When baking the heart contract and the pressure generated raktanaliharuma ' pressure ' or ' blood pressure ' is called.

31706,"Mental disorders, is the perpetual paralysis , heart-foot hdayaghata , Eye-foot blindness , kidney failure is kidney-foot.
"
31707,"At any time those with high blood pressure diseases, these blood pressure can arise in these dangerous situations.
"
31708,"To avoid these dangerous conditions, high blood pressure patients should be taken into medication even when the blood pressure is normal.
"
31709,"It is important to understand this important fact.
"
31710,"Due to ignorance and negligence, there is a list of thousands of people who have suffered these dangerous consequences.
"
31711,"The number of people who die as heart attack is too much.
"
31712,"Many patients have used to them , side effects of the drug to control blood pressure, being that.
"
31713,"After starting the drug consumption, many people close the middle after the blood pressure is controlled.
"
31714,"And as a result , some people suffer from malady , somebody's pains , and others lose their light.

31719,"Successful life after Kidney Transplant : Poudel
"
31720,"The person who is dedicated to social service can not be expressed in the mental pain of the family when he is exhausted from family and society.
"
31721,"On one side the pain of disease increased, on the other hand, in the diet
"
31722,"After five years, Bharat Lal Shrestha was under health condition after Kidney Transplat at Chennai, Tamil Nadu Hospital.
"
31723,"There should be a single change.
"
31724,"Five years later, Kidney Shrestha from Diabetes both left for work.
"
31725,"If its treatment in Nepal is like impossible, there is no guarantee of remedies abroad.
"
31726,"In such a situation, Shrestha did not lose any courage.
"
31727,"And , after regular treatment , he is currently spending normal routine.
"
31728,"Presents - A discussion of Sadha Sabha representation in his words.
"
31729,"After 30 years, I became more mild and more thirsty.
"
31730,"Along with me, we were also weak.
"
31731,"With this symptom, I suspect that I am diabetes.
"
31732,"The test was sure to have diabetes and I had to change my daily routine and lifestyle.
"
31733,"Instead of leopard, both sacked wheat bread had to be eaten.
"
31734,"Even though the vegetarians eat more, my eyes have become weak.
"
31735,"My studies also decreased greatly.
"
31736,"No meetings , ceremonies and festivals were attended , because of family food , it was social and family-feeling alone.
"
31737,"Shortly afterwards , I had reached South Korea for participating in the Expo 70 ' International Business Exhibition ' .
"
31738,"I had to be very busy in Nepalese Stuttle.
"
31739,"While testing a health check, my blood saw sugar volume in 5050.
"
31740,"Usually, its quantity shows 115 pieces in the stomach and doctors should be less than 140 after eating.
"
31741,"Still, I did not feel like that.
"
31742,"Whereas the doctors advised me to take insulin from the needle.
"
31743,"But because my disease is older, that drug may not have stopped me.
"
31744,"After 25 years of diabetes, various parts of my body started to hear.
"
31745,"Respiration , could not walk , was weak and I end up.
"
31746,"At that time I used to have a kitchen.
"
31747,"See also my body lacks blood from the test.
"
31748,"In this situation, I spent one year in treatment of kidney disease.
"
31749,"I started at the beginning . Find out that Kiddi failed from Rishikumar Kafle.
"
31750,"At first, treatment can not be done , it is anxiety whether the treatment is successful or not .
"
31751,"Even if the treatment was successful , not only the cost of spending was also regret.
"
31752,"Even after mixing money for treating treatment, I have been persecuted for a long time with mental stress.
"
31753,"But my family and my relatives have never been stressed and unhappy.
"
31754,"I thought that the treatment should be taken to the transplant till possible.
"
31755,"Accordingly, the house - family was advised.
"
31756,"DR . Many times, Rishikumar Kafle recalled and gave examples of many patients living in general.
"
31757,"He suggested that the patient for the transplant and the patients with the help of the patients.
"
31758,"Earlier, our family members were advised to take kidneys and transplants, but after blood was not crushed, kidneys had to find.
"
31759,"Causes were not difficult to find kidneys accidentally.
"
31760,"Due to lack of general testing of crushing blood in Nepal, sending me blood and kidney blood to India.
"
31761,"For this, blood should be crushed within three hours to remove both blood in the stomach.
"
31762,"However, here itself both were brought to the hospital of India for three hours from the blood-fired aircraft.
"
31763,"Fortunately, when I got news from the news that was successful in Krishmachich, my happiness was not at that time.
"
31764,"Where has the world reached the world in the 21st century , but there is great ambition for us to go to India for treatment.
"
31765,"It is very sad that the government does not even get the general facilities to be achieved in this situation.
"
31766,"Kidney transplanting patients and Kidneys should be inspected at the same time at the same time.
"
31767,"After the operation, four hours later, I was kept in a cubic treatment room for five days on the back of the health worker.
"
31768,"After losing nine hours for a long time, after opening open, almost a tear was touched when some relatives were unable to meet.
"
31769,"In any case , I have a strong self-confidence, I become tougher successful broker.
"
31770,"But later due to the execution of other members, I could not sustain it.
"
31771,"So, I am currently consulting people in institutional affairs.
"
31772,"Because Kidney's patients are equally necessary for counseling and self-control as well.
"
31773,"Diabetes should control food to prevent sugar and high blood pressure.
"
31774,"The government also aims to increase the number of dialysis machines and facilitate the treatment in addition to initiating the development of skilled manpower for kidneys.
"
31775,"After finding a diabetic leaf in 2031 years, his medicines were eating regularly and after the kidney transplant, another medication has been added.
"
31776,"I am still disrupting all those medicines.
"
31777,"But Kiddi is not in danger of being depressed.
"
31778,"In the meantime , the life of a transplant active life can be pushed after 25 , 30 years.
"
31779,"Now the number of patients suffering from Kidney Transplant in Nepal has reached 200.
"
31780,"Kiddi's patients have got an example that can easily be released from this disease.
"
31781,"But cooperation , goodwill , inspiration and encouragement to individuals , families must NHRC Minister and society.

33240,"What are the research centers of the hospital, Shailendra Thapa?
"
33241,"Private Hospital , Nursingham
"
33242,"Although Anamnagar Poklikin claimed that he was investigating the research , he has not been able to open.
"
33243,"Not only , a sater rental and a drug shop operates a research center with the name of the shop.
"
33244,"Many research center operators are unaware regarding the fact that the concerned body has no interest in it.
"
33245,"In essence, the relevant body has not yet made clear criteria for the research center.
"
33246,"After registering a research center even a few years ago, the concerned institution related to the Government of Sri 5 was arranged for a few percentage of tax.
"
33247,"That is why some say it is intended to hold a research center.
"
33248,"But now that system has been removed.
"
33249,"So, some researchers do not have any knowledge about what is research and what they are doing when they work.
"
33250,"The name sole research center should usually work after keeping a research center with the name of the hospital and the clinic , but it is not happening.
"
33251,"Researchers say they are not able to complete the necessary process.
"
33252,"Apart from the formation of its own research committee in the approval of the Nepal Health Research Council, organizations should take approval of the Council before researching any health related issues.
"
33253,"But people who have not yet applied for approval are yet to be told.
"
33254,"However, there is no lack of monitoring and inspection to not apply for any request.
"
33255,"Council chairman Dr . Sachakecar Pahari, who wants to do research, wants to get approval from the Council.
"
33256,"Shortly before some organizations tried to investigate the process not being processed, the Council had issued information regarding any prior notice of research.
"
33257,""" Research by the Center did ?
"
33258,"Information was issued to inform you about it . - Dr. Say hello
"
33259,"Some major hospitals in the research center have said that ordinary research has done.
"
33260,"Kathmandu , Chabahil Medicare National Hospital and Research Center Medical Department head Dr . Pradeep Kumar Yadav says that he is a 11-member research committee.
"
33261,"So the hospital has established research committee and has been informed about the health research council.
"
33262,"Therefore, no research should be taken from the Council when there is no research.
"
33263,"' So the hospital tells you where Thyroid hormones and research related to the past.
"
33264,"But the board kept small clinic Research Center, said a study - the investigation have not been able to.
"
33265,"Although Balaju Gangubhyaya Purnima Parmima Medical Hall and Research Center claimed to be research, no concrete information and answer could be answered.
"
33266,"The medical doctor sanjayavikrama best ' research have file ' turn a - half months handsomely.
"
33267,"Truthful diagnosis and research center , employees of New Baneshwar , could not even say what their clinic has done .
"
33268,"Clinic also requires a skilled manpower to research research on any topic.
"
33269,"There are also rules and criteria for its policy.
"
33270,"To conduct research, a separate research committee should be formed and its information should also be made in the concerned council.
"
33271,"More than 1 - 2 people in the health sector are hard to research only.
"
33272,"However, there is a lack of manpower in the clinical and research center that connects with medical solutions.
"
33273,"Gangima, director of the Purnima Medical Hall and Research Center , told that Diwakar Gautam, who is a total of 2 researchers, has been present.
"
33274,"Director of Anamnagar Polynnik, Annamnagar, operated for the last 7 years . The devotee, KC, told that they jointly studied with Public Health and TB Center Bhaktapur.
"
33275,"Dr, who has been ignoring taking any program till the ministry . Because of what work can be done from the public health, there is no council for pre-approval.
"
33276,"He answers about the efforts of foreign aid - ' People of the ministry do not work more than eating allowance.
"
33277,"They say ?
"
33278,"We do not know , but foreign aid has not been taken.
"
33279,"Earlier taxes were heard but not being heard.
"
33280,"According to a high source of Healthcare Department, because the ministry has ignored it, it has become like a franchise to hang a board with a research center.
"
33281,"The Ministry of Health said that effective monitoring should not be achieved by conducting effective monitoring and notifying any information available in the concerned body.
"
33282,"Lack of skilled manpower, some people in the health sector say that there is a lack of skilled manpower to investigate health in Nepal.
"
33283,"Clinic also called a research center to be ridiculous, saying a high-profile healthcare department says - ""It's not a tough research.
"
33284,"For this reason, great manpower , time and money are spent.
"
33285,"' Minor could not say about the general study research, he said.
"
33286,"This is why the Health Research Council is conducting various programs on the way to research.
"
33287,"The council is conducting an orbit about research on the names of the students who are studying the post graduate at the Medical Sciences National Institute ( Names ) Vir Hospital.
"
33288,"So, there has been no big study on health related to Nepal to achieve unusual and new results.
"
33289,"It does not mean that such research has been done , researchers have only been in the hospital - affiliates say.
"
33290,"In some cases, the government's research has not been effective even after the government cooperation is not available.
"
33291,"The need for monitoring is to increase the tendency to expect assistance from various organizations by keeping the quarterly center center.
"
33292,"But the obvious criteria for how to operate it can not be created yet.
"
33293,"The rules related to the research center, which have been associated with the standards of conducting a private hospital, have not been very effective.
"
33294,"In this standard, the two rules of the year are required to be compulsory.
"
33295,"However, it has not been able to implement this related ministry , and the health services department was not given its information.
"
33296,"' We have not given any information to the ministry , but only to listen.
"
33297,"So no information can be given about what to do now . '- An employee of the department tells us.
"
33298,"Such private organizations are registered in the Department of Health Services, Department of Labor , Home and Small Industries where they are interested.
"
33299,"The total 22 private clinics and nursinghomes have been registered in Tripuraeshwar, Department of Home and Small Industries.
"
33300,"There are 4 research centers in the registered.
"
33301,"Apart from this, the registration number in the Healthcare Department is about 5050.
"
33302,"But in the last 4 - 5 months to be registered with the Department and its work is to be done related to the Ministry.
"
33303,"The department has been told that it has not been registered with the name of the research center for some time.
"
33304,"' So, the concerned bodies are not clear about who to follow.
"
33305,"Ministry staff should observe what the Council said Council Member Secretary handsomely . Anil Mishra says the Ministry should look at it.
"
33306,"Furthermore, after the notice of the pre-information, some organizations have come to obtain permission and approval for the organization . Mishra tells
"
33307,"Clinic , nursingholm , hospital etc etc. should be given proper attention to the research center.
"
33308,"In fact, if research is to be done, it should be economically and technological.
"
33309,"Little manpower and low budget do not even be research.
"
33310,"It should be taken seriously by the Research Council , the concerned ministry .
"
33311,"Nepal's involvement in cancer against cancer
"
33312,"Everest Biotechnology is also exporting to different countries, producing ' Antibodies ' in the investigation against Shyendra Thapa's deviously suspected cancer disease .
"
33313,"The company started this kind of work in Nepal for the first time in 2000.
"
33314,"The organization now produces antibodies in the country
"
33315,"The limb is being bundled with antenna to remove pure antibodies from the blood of the blood of lamb.
"
33316,"Many scientists and organizations of the world have been providing research on cancer against cancer.
"
33317,"Everest biotech for antibi products is commercially selling pesticides to the local farmers in Sildandanda of Chapali VDC.
"
33318,"The healthy Khasbokka, bought from certain villages of Kavre district, is kept on direct monitoring of the visiting doctors for the purpose of local farmers.
"
33319,"Ravindra Sapopota, director of Everest Biotechnology and Scientist, told that the monthly vaccine was given monthly and Vitamin to feed Khisboka.
"
33320,"For three months, local farmers get pesticides , for them , the institution provides certain amount , and also the arrangement of the grain biotech.
"
33321,"After the treatment of three months, the blood of Khisboo is considered to be removed from the ' antibodies ' , which means that the blood cord of the coconut is caused by blood collection.
"
33322,"A littering blood is removed from a pepper.
"
33323,"The meat meat used in the use of blood is not eaten.
"
33324,"There is no study of food , but there is no study.
"
33325,"However, there is no study in the outside country, even here, says Sakakota, a scientist who has no interest in this regard.
"
33326,"That affect the health of local residents khandainan meat , rather than digging holes.
"
33327,"How Antibody is ready ?
"
33328,"After collecting the blood on the lazards of the Maharajganj organization, the task of preparing antibodies is started.
"
33329,"For this, blood is stored in the refrigerator for about 24 hours.
"
33330,"The substance of water like blood in the blood is an element of extracting antibodies.
"
33331,"The frozen frozen blood is destroyed properly.
"
33332,"Water substance is called ' serum ' .
"
33333,"The serum is then placed at a temperature of 40 minutes 56 degrees.
"
33334,"After the fixed time is completed, antibody is prescribed by typing in a 4-degree cold, keeping it with ammonium sulfate.
"
33335,"The antibody stored in this way is then checked by binding with antennas.
"
33336,"According to Lab Technician Rajendra Kumar Ghimire, the antibody exits from a liter blood to 20 million people, and some of them are not zero percent.
"
33337,"It usually takes about 15 days to remove pure antibodies from one liter blood.
"
33338,"Prepared thus, antibodies have been made available at the University of Oxford in Britain, involved in research against cancer and other scientists of many other countries.
"
33339,"In Nepal
"
33340,"The limb is being bundled with antenna to remove pure antibodies from the blood of the blood of lamb.
"
33341,"What this study - to investigate the lack of appropriate human resources, talks about the visvavidyalayasanga with allowance kyansaraviruddhako scientific sapakaota says.
"
33342,"Sapapota said that after researching essential antibodies in cancer against cancer , now it is necessary to produce necessary chemicals in the research of AIDS , hepatitis etc. in Nepal .
"
33343,"Antibody produced in excellent production is considered excellent in the world.
"
33344,"Explaining the reason for this reason, Sachakota, a scientist, says - "" Where we are purification and the health of the poor people born in Nepal.
"
33345,"""In addition to this, economic deficit is also cheaper due to the long-term purification process.
"
33346,"' Can some foreign citizens be such a product in Nepal ?
"
33347,"Says Sakakota, a scientist who is surprisingly surprised.
"
33348,"So, the work was done in Nepal to utilize cheap labor due to the consumption of pesticides and extracting antibodies from the UK.
"
33349,"It has also been successful in short time.
"
33350,"Due to good production, enough investors are available, says Rabindra Sapopota, a scientist who can occupy the leading place in Antibody's World Bank.
"
33351,"Joint efforts against cancer are prepared by preparing antibodies in the UK and sending the UK to the economic cooperation between the two countries.
"
33352,"For the same reason, Nepal and the UK scientists have been involved in joint efforts to overcome the world's terrifying disease.
"
33353,"Although there is a study on this in many countries of the world, there is no chance to tell about how much success has been achieved.
"
33354,"Nepali scientific sapakaota says - ' biological technology inspired by the objective of the establishment of Atlas, we're going in this work.
"
33355,""" Therefore, by producing more entibadi vaijnanikaharusamaksa and bring it to other countries kyansaviruddhako important research efforts in Nepal and efforts are being made to participate.
"
33356,"So, cancer is a terrible disease and its complete treatment is not possible anywhere in the world.
"
33357,"Thousands of people have lost lives in the world due to cancer.
"
33358,"But no reason to respond solidly for what causes this disease.
"
33359,"Many of the world's scientists are constantly studying and researching this disease.
"
33360,"But even if there is a success, there is no one anywhere.
"
33361,"Nepal is also participating in this work.
"
33362,"Success from this research will appear in the world's health sector in Nepal.
"
33363,"Clean teeth for effective personality
"
33364,"DR . Harsh zoo is a great role in presenting every person in the field of influential personality.
"
33365,"A special personality needs a special person's interview on special occasions for meeting someone or for any important work.
"
33366,"At that time the structure of the good teeth also makes a difference.
"
33367,"So you need to take good care of your teeth.
"
33368,"Every person with good and healthy teeth
"
33369,"Life is directly or indirectly affected.
"
33370,"So there are some tips to keep healthy and clean teeth here.
"
33371,"There are no such secret sources to keep healthy.
"
33372,"However, some basic bosses should be implemented in their daily routine.
"
33373,"After lunch to brush : dantaleu 9ebinagabha a kind of tansine 0 , not 8226 Second watches unseen , tooth surface layer is deposited.
"
33374,"It contains bacteria.
"
33375,"It constantly stays in the tooth surface.
"
33376,"Regardless of brushing , the dental can only be converted at 8226 ambitious at some time , and on the other hand, it stimulates gastrointestinal diseases as soon as possible by eating the teeth with teeth.
"
33377,"Every time you can not brush after meals, even at least in the morning - evening meal, it is necessary to brush twice a day.
"
33378,"Other times the water should rinse well.
"
33379,"Use of thread cleaning thread : Regarding cleaning the tooth clean should be used regularly.
"
33380,"Also, the surface of the teeth starts with the insects.
"
33381,"Therefore , such problems can be resolved using the special thread thread ( real estate ) cleaning the teeth .
"
33382,"Balanced food : Dentists are the only teeth - the main factor in glanding problem.
"
33383,"Because the dentist produces harmful acids 9home 0 from the fat substance in the food.
"
33384,"This outer part of the tooth ( enamel ) and the inner part ( dentin ) until affected.
"
33385,"Therefore, especially if not to be done, especially pay attention to the child's diet.
"
33386,"The sweet ones with sugar , lassayukta food and beverage food as possible should be discouraged.
"
33387,"The food is very greasy and like a tasting substance - chocolate does not even affect the normal health but it also basically disorders the teeth.
"
33388,"Even so, even if some problems of teeth do not work properly or using thread, they will not be solved.
"
33389,"So , as long as possible , it is best to dental at every 6-6 months as long as possible .
"
33390,"Bruce for healthy smile : Toothpaste and teeth of food products regularly need to dig the brotherhood.
"
33391,"The best brush time is after eating a meal every time , but it may not always be possible at all places.
"
33392,"If it is not possible to do it at least two times a day after the main meal, it should be brushed.
"
33393,"What kind of brush do you use ?
"
33394,": Brush must be so small that it can reach out in every part of the mouth.
"
33395,"The upper part of the brush that is brushed , its length 2 . 5 . Min . For older people and for children 1 . 5 . Min . Must be
"
33396,"Brussels ( Brussels nylon thread , on which toothpaste ) are kept from length 1 to 1 . Min . Must be
"
33397,"The brass's choice is in the condition of each person's tooth and cataract.
"
33398,"Bruce is a choice of brush or soft skin.
"
33399,"Strong brush can damage teeth and gastricides.
"
33400,"Any brus can be used only for a limited period of time.
"
33401,"Using such brands for more than that time, it can hurt or hurt other than the benefits.
"
33402,"Brussels should look regularly at Brussels's nails, namely Brussels, to check whether the brus you use is fine or not.
"
33403,"If brushes are broken or 8226 times 8226 , it should be considered to have the time to change the brass .
"
33404,"But some - one found in a short time, brisalaharu damaged by a complaint , it is not the main cause of brush sahirupale use.
"
33405,"Electric brass is also found in the market for non-ordinary brass use.
"
33406,"Usually this brush is used , but more useful for other brusers can not be used.
"
33407,"The brush is the head of the brush which vibrates in the electric brush , which should be kept in a plain face like other ordinary brass.
"
33408,"Methods of brass : What is the first focus on breastfeeding is to clean all the surface of the teeth.
"
33409,"Breath should start with the above teeth.
"
33410,"Starting right from the right path and going to the left.
"
33411,"Brass should be added to the part of a 45 degree angle in the part to add the tooth and the gauge - upwards or rotating speeds.
"
33412,"Gum, brush the surface before - back and should be used.
"
33413,"This process should repeat when the teeth are cleaned and at the end should water well.
"
33414,"In some cases, if any accident or special reason falls in any teeth, the chando should have artificial teeth in the same place.
"
33415,"If the nutrients are stored in the part of the empty glue, food items can be combined with bacteria.
"
33416,"There is no beauty in the face.
"
33417,"Even more importantly, if you do not balance the balance of food, it is also a strong teeth because it also damages tooth and gum.
"
33418,"It makes it easy to brush too.
"
33419,"As a result of uncomfortable food packaging, food and tea are also affected.
"
33420,"In this situation, contact the dental surgeon.
"
33421,"Dental surgeons can provide advice for essential orthopedic treatment or a small surgical requirement.
"
33422,"In some cases, if the child needs to be treated as early as possible, when there is an age matched more effective.
"
33423,"Enzyme : worse than disadvantages
"
33424,"But does not such an enzyme eating food for food and digestive food is being ignored ?
"
33425,"It is important to consider.
"
33426,"In fact, such ingredients that are consumed for profit
"
33427,"Benefits are not zero for the body.
"
33428,"An essential factor for digesting enzyme carbohydrate and protein , which is to produce itself from the body.
"
33429,"Therefore, there is no need to eat enzymes abroad.
"
33430,"In addition, the cover ( canned ), various fruit juice, not the actual enzyme photosameta placed fake brandy smell.
"
33431,"According to the Pharmaceutical Association of Pharmaceutical Association, Baburam Humagai, who is being sold only in Enzyme Nepal and India.
"
33432,"Such types of medicines do not work against any disease if they are not encouraged or interested in food.
"
33433,"The liquid of the enzyme found in liquor and mill can be even more harmful.
"
33434,"Anzyme is more unnecessary and meaningless than the vitamin's liquid in the market, is the analysis of Baburam Humagai.
"
33435,"The fruits of the outer shell are artificial and only the ways to attain attractive attention.
"
33436,"Although in large quantities of production in Nepal, its neighboring country has also grown in large quantities.
"
33437,"In the Nepali market, there are currently 5 brand gram of the Pinguactic group and 10 of 32 out of 32 other types of mill and other jolly enzyme are available.
"
33438,"Its 2 main disadvantages do not have to be beneficial for any benefit and meaning, and spending unnecessary money.
"
33439,"But using this type of drug is not only beneficial , but it is only a waste.
"
33440,"Therefore, unnecessarily spending money for enzymes has no meaning and benefit.
"
33441,"Bhrushhini Ghimirevir, son of Shamsher, cooked gold, used to eat a golden bowl filled with black gold.
"
33442,"The recipe used by gold and gold was not merely prestigious but also with the potential of disease-resistant, and strengthened the disease.

33446,"Not only was this necessary to have a large amount of surroundings.
"
33447,"Likewise meat cooked as a result of meat was cooked with a pepper.
"
33448,"The chicken-cooked meat cooked for a long time was eaten as sauce.
"
33449,"Even if there is a lot of pain, it will be delicious, because Rana tells the historian who had licked his fingers.
"
33450,""" Rudrasamaseralai knowledge of Ayurvedic and homiyopethi ausadhisambandhi , and was also interested in the circuit.
"
33451,"Hence, under the leadership of herbicide-based coconut, life-saving oil was made from different animal animals.
"
33452,"Similarly, v . NO . In 1973, he wrote a book called ' Homeopathic Family Therapy ' .
"
33453,"Historian Rana accepts that she used gold , dough and peppers as a medicine because of some knowledge related to this medicine.
"
33454,"On top of the gold , it is not to be consumed without gold, because gold is kept as if it is gold.
"
33455,"Rana tells us that the same time he heard the rice cooked again in rice.
"
33456,"Rana is expected to turn the rice into a pharmaceutical form.
"
33457,"But Rana tells us that she does not know about it.
"
33458,"The gold can not be used as a medicinal drug but can be used by the drug and can be used as a medication of DrDD Naradevi Ayurved Hospital . Thakur drug tells
"
33459,"He says - ' Gold can be processed and various kinds of golden plants can be made.
"
33460,"People of this kind of microscopic illness and illness can be consumed as a tunic.
"
33461,""" Rudrasamaserale the golden ball as the rice to eat tonic might have put bhatama Dr . Thakur has the perception.
"
33462,"According to religious and cultural opinion, gold is very important.
"
33463,"Discrimination , wash - sutaka , Although her academic advisor of the Holy sunapani cokhina is customarily so far.
"
33464,"Consumption of drinking water is also very old for physical health.
"
33465,"Similarly wearing a gold ring or other jewelery adds beauty to its growth , it also maintains healthy health.
"
33466,"As coral , pearl, etc. will benefit pattharayukta ring holds the healthy benefits of the deity of the same gold.
"
33467,"It is in Hindu society that wearing jewelery as a jewelery and a small piece after the death, and even putting gold in the mouth.
"
33468,"That's just as beneficial for health.
"
33469,"Therefore, by understanding the importance of gold, Rana has eaten and cooked rice.
"
33470,"In Nepal, there is no number of Nepali people who go abroad abroad for treatment, which can not be treated in Telmeiden Thapa.
"
33471,"But due to financial reasons, it is not possible to everyone.
"
33472,"The number of people going to India abroad is large.
"
33473,"Even if we are going to treat the burden, various difficulties and conflicts, including economic, are increasing.
"
33474,"But now, the compulsion to spend on India and spending huge money has to be somewhat removed.
"
33475,"There is a new facility in the hospital sitting here in a hospital room and can be treated from the doctor of India.
"
33476,"This is done by ' telemedidine ' ie far healthcare.
"
33477,"Omaha Hospital in Chhilhal, Kathmandu has recently launched treatment service through this technology.

34046,"Due to lack of immune capacity in the child, they are likely to infect diseases.
"
34047,"Because 60 percent of Nepal's children are suffering from malnutrition.
"
34048,"The newborn will be the mother of milk for a period of six months.
"
34049,"I do not need any other food for 6 months if I feed my mother with a good milk.
"
34050,"After 6 months the child can be given a solid diet with mother's milk.
"
34051,"But there is an opinion that the children who are having a one-year-old child having a home to eat every day.
"
34052,"Personal hygiene has also given significant importance to the disease of children.
"
34053,"Children's feeding and polishing foam , surrounding environment, and the health of a person who provides children directly impact the health of the child.
"
34054,"There is a saying that ' disease conductor is young and aged child ' .
"
34055,"Similarly, parents are also the carriers of the disease.
"
34056,"That is why the health of the children in the health of the parents is directly influenced by the health of parents and youth because the child's guardian needs to pay special attention to his health.
"
34057,"Drotomyxol medicines will be suitable for the patients receiving pneumonia and bush during treatment . Baral suggestion
"
34058,"Vitamin ' A ' , which is distributed freely to children by the Government of Sri 5, can also pause the pneumonia.
"
34059,"It is equally important to understand that pneumonia-based pneumonia also controls the cure given against cure.
"
34060,"In the past, mothers have got their infants to feed milk instead.
"
34061,"Potential milk infections are more likely to inflict infants.
"
34062,"The child's illness is more if the child's disease - resistant potential is higher.
"
34063,"Immunoglobin element helps to increase the risk of disease-resistant.
"
34064,"Since the child acceeds the body from mother's milk, there is a lot of disease - resistant potential in this child .
"
34065,"But instead of immunoglobin, milk is not included.
"
34066,"Therefore, children with scarlet milk have very low risk of immune - resistant and as a result they are more likely to suffer from disease.
"
34067,"Instead of using milk instead of instead of milk, it seems to be encouraged to prevent children from being malnourished and to avoid many other diseases.
"
34068,"There is also a very significant factor in kidney disease.
"
34069,"Disease, malnutrition is a man - immune system, different diseases may be reduced.
"
34070,"So mother needs to be educated to alert all things.
"
34071,"Even if children get any disease, they are also seeking medicines without seeing the health workers.
"
34072,"Such a medication can lead to complexity and death of children.
"
34073,"Due to others, the disease - resistant capacity in children should be very low because they should pay special attention to their health.

"

"
34101,"Similarly, if the anortic wells are coronary, the blood decreases in the heart.
"
34102,"As a result, blood operations also decrease and chest pain can occur.
"
34103,"Due to lack of blood pressure on the brain, ringtones and sickness may also occur.
"

"
34121,"After the development of open-heart surgery, the situation of well-being will be able to change or repair.

"
34126,"Because of mechanical well-being and durability, patients can be used for lesser age.
"
34127,"But, after keeping it well, the patient needs to take regular medication of blood-soluble medicines.
"
34128,"In the yankicak, one and two two and two types of wells have also been available.
"
34129,"Compared to single-hearted well-being, two-rupees goodwill is some expensive and it is considered more effective.
"
34130,"According to a statistics, about 15 percent of acne-rich people who suffer from blood may increase blood.
"
34131,"However, only 3 to 5 percent of two-year-old well-being patients can only bleed blood.
"
34132,"Compared to the device, keeping the biological well-being of a very cheaply cheap diet, do not eat medicinal blood-cutting medicines.
"
34133,"But it's more likely to mess.
"
34134,"This good work must be changed in 10 , 15 years.
"
34135,"Because there is no way to break the damaged organic well-being.
"
34136,"Even if artificial well-being is replaced in Nepal, there is also a facility of well-being in the developed countries.
"
34137,"DR . According to the Vaidya, there is no possibility of goodwill transplant in Nepal since conservation of wells and necessary materials and priorities to test for transplant.
"
34138,"Its open heart surgery was only at the Veer Hospital.
"
34139,"Three years later, this operation was started in Ganga Lal Hadi center, except for Rs. 5 thousand rupees apart from Bhavab.
"
34140,"Three years later, an Institute of Russia had sold a good value of $ 450 ( less than 30 thousand Nepali rupees ) .
"
34141,"But the patient had to pay Rs. 5,000 in Nepal's same goodwill.
"
34142,"After this, the Bhavab Agent of Nepal agreed to provide the same well-being to the tune of Rs 78,000 in addition to the VAT.
"
34143,"The same agent is offering its value in 67 thousand instead of the VAT, respectively.
"
34144,"But after the Indian well-being also available in 40 thousand rupees, the same US company has said that the same wellbeing could be available to 9000.
"
34145,"Veer hospital only takes Rs 80,000 for renovation Open Heart Surgery.
"
34146,"Using surgery for older and helpless, the operation is found in 63 thousand rupees.
"
34147,"In the Veer hospital, the doctors do not take extra money for surgery, and there is also provision of free shawls for the patients who have been there for others.
"
34148,"But this amount can be decreased in the last time . The chief tells.
"
34149,"Dr. Anita, who is a resident of Uttar Pradesh Hospital, can be operated at Rs . Vaidya claims.
"
34150,"Similarly, in the private hospital including Nehruk and private hospitals, the same operation is estimated to be 3 lakh 20 thousand rupees and Rs. 3 lakhs were taken for this operation in the medical.
"
34151,"Therefore, the number of patients suffering from a well-being in private hospitals is also very low.
"
34152,"B & B Insurance has been conducted at least 10 as many as two cases have been completed in the medical condition.
"
34153,"In Nazarak, about 15 people are told that the illness of the patient is replaced.
"
34154,"This facility is provided only to the Veer Hospital for this financial year, as the patients are getting its facilities soon.
"
34155,"Apart from the government, various organizations and physicians have also been raising support for changing the well.
"
34156,"Financial efforts have been made and operated by the efforts of its doctors for ill patients who are visiting the Veer hospital.
"
34157,"DR . Vaidya says - "" We have also conducted surgery with only 20 thousand rupees in Veer Hospital.""
"
34158,"' For this, account of Cardiotherapy and Bhaskar Surgery Unit of Veer Hospital has been taken into account at the National Commerce Bank Bhotihati branch.
"
34159,"The willing donor, who has been operating at the bank account number 2340, has collected the amount he wants.
"
34160,"The sick people have been expelled from the same funds for treatment.
"
34161,"Mr. 5 Shahjyaadi Jaini Smriti Establishment Fund has been providing assistance to a patient for the help of helpless heart patients.
"
34162,"In addition, Dr. Kanti Children . The amount collected by the British physicians with the help of Vipin Joshi has been providing Gangaalal National Heart Centers.
"
34163,"There are also foreigners not only Nepali , but those who support for well.
"
34164,"Shortly before, American doctor Frederick Grover had provided 14 well-being Gangaalal freebies.
"
34165,"Similarly, doctors garta astirayana chariot time - the time of the districts in patients who are co.
"
34166,"He is coming out with the financial situation of the patients, with full expenses for returning to the well and helping somebody with some share.
"
34167,"In the Child Protection Program under the same Foundation , needle , penicillin , lacics and lanoxine have been distributed free of charge from their own sources.
"
34168,"The sick people who have taken care of their attention after the goodness need to save blood throughout the month.
"
34169,"The medication has been recommended for the patient based on the report of the same test called PT , INR in the medical language .
"
34170,"Because blood is thick, it is recommended that the blood of the patient can be enriched in the well, because the blood is thickened from the test, the drug that makes the blood powder to the patient is recommended.
"
34171,"But even if blood is more fat, there may be a problem of bleeding.
"
34172,"Because of the possibility of bleeding women, they can not produce a baby.
"
34173,"After returning the well, the patient should also eat the medicines regularly.
"
34174,"But the patient's circumstances, no - no drug can be reduced to take.
"
34175,"The patients starting blood-soluble medicines do not eat green cereals and eat lesser than they eat.
"
34176,"But little foods should eat the same proportion.
"
34177,"Likewise, such patients do not eat bulk at any cost.
"
34178,"Similarly , the doctor's consultation must be taken for eating medicines like NSAIDE, which reduce vitamins , antibiotics and pain.
"
34179,"Similarly, when using blood that is blood-thin, it can also hurt the arthritis.
"
34180,"In this case, immediately consult the doctor.
"
34181,"Similarly, such patients do not eat fruitless and unhealthy species.
"
34182,"Such fruits make blood thin because it can have adverse effects on health.
"
34183,"Blood can be thin if it is thin , can easily bleed from gaze and sit in the neolitham.
"
34184,"So far, more than 400 well-being well-being in Nepal has been thrown away.
"
34185,"Operation of 95 percent of the well-being of the well-being patients has succeeded.
"
34186,"Therefore, the obligation to go abroad for the well-being is over.
"
34187,"In Gangaalal Haryana Center, five days have been operated in recent weeks.
"
34188,"Due to sufficient human power, there can be 10 surgical operations in one week, as the government-owned facility can easily use Gangaalal Hospital.
"
34189,"However, only one open week surgery can be performed throughout the week at Veer Hospital because of surgery only one week.
"
34190,"Only 15 to 20 people have been replaced.
"
34191,"In the absence of adequate manpower, it is very difficult to change the well-being of 50 people within one year of Bir Hospital.
"
34192,"On the one hand, the patient's disease in Ganglang is increasing to increase if the patient's disease is decreasing at the Veer Hospital.
"
34193,"Therefore, the government's attention is needed to bring the necessary manpower to the well-being in the Veer Hospital, which is serving at affordable rates.
"
34194,"If so, 150 government distributors distributing annually will be able to feed new Nepalese patients.
"
34195,"However, the cost of the operation is higher than the value of good value.
"
34196,"Therefore, government grants could be added in support of non-governmental organizations for surgery. The operation of the well-being of a heart-affected heart can be very simple in Nepal.

"
34221,"It was difficult to resolve the problem.
"
34222,"Some women expect health problems and hope that the problem is resolved.
"
34223,"But when there is a lack of female health workers in health checkpoints, male health workers are found to be very difficult to see where the pain in their body is.
"
34224,"On the other hand, some maternal laborers are found to have less knowledge of women's angles.
"
34225,"Do not even know how to keep ring pacer etc.
"
34226,"The ring pacer also saw only a few.
"
34227,"After this training program, a health camp was immediately started.
"
34228,"Whereas those health workers get a lot of experience.
"
34229,"After this, watching the records at Doty and Achham Hospital, the famine had done much to keep ring piercing after training.
"
34230,"After giving simple suggestions, women saw increasing order for treatment.
"
34231,"There is no complete treatment for the problem of eating room.
"
34232,"There is a problem of financial problems , due to family , social and cultural reasons, women also get deprived of treatment.
"
34233,"In 2001, after conducting training in Achham and Doti and a health camp, about 200 women were supposed to have lunch operations.
"
34234,"What happened to me was that surgery of two women will be completed 6 months.
"
34235,"But what happened to the matter, after 6 months, after getting to know the hospital, only 30 women were diagnosed.
"
34236,"Even if we had money , resources , doctors , all means, the women suffering from suffering were not coming to treatment.
"
34237,"Who does the house work ?
"
34238,"Women to the hospital ?
"
34239,"' Etc. Due to the reasons why the treatment facility is available, women have not been able to treat.
"
34240,"Some organizations have been doing programs in the field of education.
"
34241,"But there is no research on the national problem.
"
34242,"In the past working experience, 24 percent of the age of reproductive health have been suffering from it.
"
34243,"But this can not be taken as a national figure.
"
34244,"However, the glimpse of the health of women in remote areas shows it.
"
34245,"During the work of Far East, another thing came to know.

34253,"We finally have a family man and a woman started to say something , suggest that we have started.
"
34254,"But the social structure is that women should stay together even if they suffer.
"
34255,"Even if the expectation of some treatment in the hospital can not give us much treatment.
"
34256,"A woman who came to the hospital said, ' How did the ladders get out? ' - After getting a child, 11 days later, I had to sit in the dungeon.

"
35138,"This helps contribute to family support and understanding.
"
35139,"So my belief is that not only sister-in-law but also brothers will be useful.
"
35140,"From the time of adolescence entering the girl's condition, every girl receives about 9 months each week.
"
35141,"This sequence keeps running until mature.
"
35142,"For the first time, the amount of silver is generally between 13 to 16 years.
"
35143,"But due to physical texture , hereditary ( mother-in-law ), geographical condition, etc. also affect the onset of silver .
"
35144,"So candoma 8 , 9 years old, and slow to 18 , 1 9 years of girls have been found to initiate separation.
"
35145,"In the geographical area of ​​summer water, girls are quick to fall and the snowflowing girls with cold water are late.
"
35146,"Women who experience illness every month do not even know about it and the natural process.
"
35147,"Because they do not get the opportunity to get real knowledge about it.
"
35148,"So, many have no knowledge about the reality of the female.
"
35149,"In the process of pregnancy, sexually 8226 in the body of the female - such as ovaries , eggs , orbital hose , lingerie and vaginal remains the main role.
"
35150,"Every woman's uterus to the right and the left one - pick up the two are in the ovary.
"
35151,"One of them leaves one egg ( full ) each from the elliptic .
"
35152,"He and the ladders arrive in the lingerie by way of the orbital hose attached to the lungs.
"
35153,"This type of egg, which comes out of the ovary, is the way of the orbital tube, it takes about 72 hours to reach the lunch home.
"
35154,"This is 72 days, if there is an intercourse between women and men within a period of three days, women are pregnant if they are pregnant.
"
35155,"However, every month, the men coming out of the month, and the men from the sexual intercourse, can not be pregnant.
"
35156,"This type of time is not conceived and some time remains in the kitchen and then dies itself.
"
35157,"Thus the dead and the liver fluid in the vagina exit.
"
35158,"The same is called as silver.
"
35159,"Unknowingly blood cells are also destroyed to provide nutritious element with dead eggs.
"
35160,"On the grounds, that too goes out.
"
35161,"If pregnancy and eggs are not destroyed , instead of being kept in the upper house, nine months later, they are born as a newborn.
"
35162,"After pregnancy, other eggs do not stop , so there is no risk of pregnancy.
"
35163,"By preventing monthly transactions, most women find the way they are pregnant.
"
35164,"The blood poured on the silver is contaminated.
"
35165,"This mixture contains a compound known as Mucus 9GG.
"
35166,"This blood does not arise.
"
35167,"Because it is contaminated, the woman ( primarily three days ) is kept from different activities throughout the period .

"
35675,"This was a very serious situation created by the crew.
"
35676,"Then, in the initiative of non-governmental organizations, they were held long time.
"

"
35679,"Due to the problem many children in the state are suffering from such problems.
"
35680,"Nevertheless, the government does not see any kind of impact on them and there has been no arrangement to treat the affected people.
"
35681,"Teen - girl how to understand mentality ?
"
35682,"DR . Ganga reader , a 18-year-old teenage teenager in Teachers ( Psychology ), Trichand College , was also learning music during the leisure period.
"
35683,"Look at the Watchtower music stage - show show.
"
35684,"He did so much when he did not know his parents and attended the concert.
"
35685,"He was watching music as the goal of his life.
"
35686,"Her father always advised her to read medical science.
"
35687,"He insisted that he should study medical science giving a number of examples.
"
35688,"From that day, the teenager started getting his life down.
"
35689,"Some enthusiasm and anchor went to death.
"
35690,"The thought of being sleeping and sitting in a basement began to shout.
"
35691,"Similarly, another 13-year-old teenager began to love her teacher.
"
35692,"Strongly with love, she started going to read Tuscan in the house of the teacher.
"
35693,"But a teenager who studied in her own class would like him very much.
"
35694,"He did not open his mind to the teenager.
"
35695,"'The teenager's response felt as teenager fell down from the roof.
"
35696,"Then, in the process of reducing the feelings of the injury of love, he began to take advantage of counterproductivity.
"
35697,"He now takes the drug into a toilet brush in the launch break of the school.
"
35698,"The day she does not do this makes her feel sad and sad.
"
35699,"One of these events - two people who just happened, but the majority of teens - Teen problems are.
"
35700,"Many parents take these problems normally.
"
35701,"Adolescence is a paternal , rebellious and confused state, and many parents are arguing that these problems are going to lose their problems as they are older.
"
35702,"Some show abusive behavior , unnecessary prevention behavior.
"
35703,"The status of the incident and the situation, but - what impact has become less sensitive about that puryauncha achieve it.
"
35704,"Teen - Teenager future construction of the concept of the state and assessment of the impact.
"
35705,"How can a teenager who is considered self-sufficient and insecure can provide protection and satisfaction to his family in future life ?
"
35706,"Neo - teenagers who have never felt prior to their wishes can not give priority to the wishes of their children.
"
35707,"So, a teenager should be healthy for a healthy future.
"
35708,"But parents and teenagers - young middle distance, instead of fueling further found growing.
"
35709,"One complains against another and unable to understand himself.
"
35710,"This type of example can be taken to a relationship between a parent and a teenager.
"
35711,"A high military official was teaching his son in the hostel of a prestigious school in Kathmandu.
"
35712,"She used to fulfill every request of her son by completing her eyes.
"
35713,"Asking , never searched for it.
"
35714,"In this process, husband - wife had to wrangle both alagasameta.
"
35715,"One day Mother - Father different - different inhabitants have tried to understand what she knew tyasasambandhama son.
"
35716,"His only interest in reading the true father , home - family, saying instead more interested in sounding insults.
"
35717,"It was her daily routine to run away from school and to eat and beat.
"
35718,"Parents and differences between the parents , except the dictatorship of the soldier's awakened father, did the teenager never get parents' good love or right guidance ?
"
35719,"So teens - girls and parents to understand the actual mentality forged teenager - a teenager his parents, feelings can apply.
"
35720,"Behavior is a teaching method , as we learn.
"
35721,"Every guardian wants his children to be the best.
"
35722,"Children of obedient and disciplined children also consider themselves as lucky and successful.
"
35723,"Because now, the task of discipline of children has become very difficult and challenging.
"
35724,"Many parents have the same complaint - children do not believe it as they say.
"
35725,"Stir up on their own.
"
35726,"Do not like reading , writing , writing wisdom , and working hard.
"
35727,"Fashion to , wear it - huhu are walking , drug consumption , Giang fight and what sex they come to the forefront.
"
35728,"Something else is wrong with your thinking, or if you do it immediately, you will be angry with yourself.
"
35729,"There is little ability to meditate , meditate, and gain accurate knowledge on anything .
"
35730,"Many do the same - send it abroad.
"
35731,"Thinking about your responsibility and daitvako teens - girls and the number is very low.
"
35732,"Particularly rich teen Minister and educated family - girl get up dayitvavihina activities and ucchrngkhalata.
"
35733,"Discipline is an important part of this situation after being created.
"
35734,"It does not mean discipline for children or adhering to what they say does not mean discipline.
"
35735,"The responsibility to be displayed according to the timely social values ​​and beliefs, and the responsibility to be employed according to age is discipline.
"
35736,"Discipline activities increase distortion and discrimination in society.
"
35737,"Robbery , fraud , vandalism , demonstrations , killing and indiscipline are the fruit of atmahatyajasta activity.
"
35738,"The young patches of the society attract these activities , which increase criminal activity and inefficiencies in the society.
"
35739,"Therefore teen - girl making a disciplined home - family, and parents should pay special attention.
"
35740,"Because no one will be born by discipline and exhortation.
"
35741,"During graduation and education, the development of discipline character is becoming increasing.
"
35742,"In keeping with discipline, expected discipline can be made for parents to take acceptable behavior from themselves without saying that.
"
35743,"Because children learn more by implicating their own behavior.
"
35744,"One of the suspects arrested in the proceedings of the authority, was arrested and arrested in charge of accumulating wealth in comparison to his position.
"
35745,"They studied at Mahango school in Kathmandu.
"
35746,"The discipline and explicit behavior in the school was always a failure in the classroom.
"
35747,"On the day the news of corruption arrested by the father's photograph was published in magazines , he could not see anyone wearing a head vertically on that day.
"
35748,"On that day he was very depressed and quietly stayed in the classroom.
"
35749,"He was not blunt , knit , and silent.
"
35750,"From this incident, we can understand two important things.
"
35751,"The first thing is that the power to destroy children or discipline is money.
"
35752,"Irritable way of earning money earns money from the kids.
"
35753,"The parents of children should work hard , hard lesson to teach them that it is achieved.
"
35754,"This lesson leads to discipline and increased malignancy.
"
35755,"Secondly, parents do wrong with giving children guidance on money.
"
35756,"More than children , the desire to send their children abroad abroad is expensive , expensive, and expensive in school.
"
35757,"And by examining their eyes, they teach each other's demands , unnecessary leave and lessons of funeral.
"
35758,"This kind of behavior makes adolescent brain irritable.
"
35759,"And they arrive to embrace Mozojis than selfishness and skill.
"
35760,"Therefore teen - teenager's way of thinking and actions of irresponsible behavior and ucchrngkhalatakopachadi parental influence is important.
"
35761,"But all the blame teen parents - school girls is to wear them.
"
35762,"Teen parents - teenager desire and his will and pleasure manobhavanalaibhanda more important to do.
"
35763,"So will his spirit and satisfaction in order to achieve a son who wants to learn music ' sung ' said the doctor forced to garaunchan.
"
35764,"Because the guardian wants to fulfill the supernatural desire he did not read the ' doctor ' from his son.
"
35765,"Parents should pay attention to making children capable and responsible and their parents' desire and lack of weakness - weakness should be abandoned to bring children to their children.
"
35766,"They should understand their attitude and ability.
"
35767,"For this, the guard should focus on the following.
"
35768,"A teenager - Desire and thinking of the teenager should look at their eyes.
"
35769,"They should appreciate their personality and feelings.
"
35770,"Do not make your point only important and bring your desire to bring it.

"
35773,"Teens - The teenager should always be treated regularly.
"
35774,"Mutual conversation and discussion parent and teen - teen to minimize the distance between negative thinking can help you make responsible puryauncha deleted.
"
35775,"By entering adolescence, there is a physical change on one side, fear of the other , mental change seems like hesitation and eagerness.
"
35776,"Parents support an important role in maintaining these two changes.
"
35777,"Because of adolescence and understanding of self-determination, in search of her, a struggle between society and family is created.
"
35778,"They become frustrated if, in the struggle to defeat it , addicted to plunge , murder - atmahatyajasta be guilty of a criminal act and do.
"
35779,"Hence, instead of hatred and blasphemy, they should help in solving their problems.
"
35780,"Kanda Each success is Rs esteem , so teens - girls and can cause a sense of inferiority to the necessities of the situation to discourage early age to teach skills.
"
35781,"Such sepents develop positive thinking of themselves as well as develop the ability to fight with the problem.

"
35792,"Being pregnant is more likely to be abortion.
"
35793,"Due to the development of reproductive organs, it is the same as a rapid and low tobacco.
"
35794,"The baby being more than two and a half years old weighing is considered healthy.
"
35795,"Because of lack of full growth of other organs and other parts of the girl's age, they can not normally become infantry.
"
35796,"In such cases their lungs can also fit.
"
35797,"The reason for which women tell doctors who can not afford to produce a child forever.
"
35798,"Similarly, there are many examples of women who have fallen in the age of sleeping.
"
35799,"Once a woman with pisperathy can not control the amount of drainage from the body.

35945,"Goods damaged , split , fighting injuries , other children's calairakhne , others keep the same khosnejasta functions.
"
35946,"Such a child can not read carefully at school.
"
35947,"This problem can be reduced by taking treatment and taking medicines.
"
35948,"Gathering in the bed : It is a common thing that the baby to melt at the bed is sometimes common.
"
35949,"But since the age of three, children often do not melt at the bed.
"
35950,"The only thing that can be done is Akkaljukkal.
"
35951,"This is not a disease or problem , seven years after urination even if the child is equal to the mattresses, it is a problem.
"
35952,"Such a child can also get punishment from the parent.
"
35953,"This problem can be reduced by consulting a psychiatrist.
"
35954,"Yes, I am also involved in other things besides physics
"
35955,"In fact, now in many other things
"
35956,"One such thing is the interconnectedness of human languages
"
35957,"Large groups 
"
35958,"Before popular families
"
35959,"They do not like that
"
35960,"They think this is crazy
"
35961,"I do not think it's crazy
"
35962,"Can it really deliver to a single ancestor who lived 20 - 25,000 years ago
"
35963,"How old do you think that is?
"
35964,"How old are the modern languages?
"
35965,"How many tens of thousand years does this reach back?
"
35966,"We call this oppression
"
35967,"Chris : Well, Philip Anderson can be right
"
35968,"You might know more about every thing than anyone else
"
35969,"This is an honorable thing
"
35970,"Thanks Murray Gale-Man
"
35971,"The numbers make this story clear
"
35972,"And I ask, "" Did you just move here?"" 
"
35973,"He looked at me and said,"" Yes
"
35974,"Or you are only a woman who has to go to the toilet
"
35975,"""( Laughter ) Now the question comes, how we can solve this problem
"
35976,"How can we change topranked numbers?
"
35977,"How to make it different?
"
35978,"I will not talk about this today - although all these are very important
"
35979,"Today I want to focus on the work we can do ourselves
"
35980,"What are the messages we must give to ourselves?
"
35981,"What is the message we must give to our daughters?
"
35982,"I do not have any correct answers, 
"
35983,"I am not for my own people
"
35984,"Sometimes I feel quite guilty
"
35985,"That is why I am not saying that it is the right thing for everyone to be in workplace
"
35986,"First, sit on the table
"
35987,"Secondly, make sure your spouse is really your life-partner
"
35988,"And third - do not leave before really leaving
"
35989,"Everyone sat on the table
"
35990,"And I kind of said to ""sit on the table please, sit""
"
35991,"And they settled on one side of the room
"
35992,"Do not you like such things in college?
"
35993,"I wish that I could still read such things
"
35994,"We three took classes together
"
35995,"We come out of the examination hall and look at each other and ask, "" How did it go?"" 
"
35996,"And my brother says,"" I got excellent marks in class ""
"
35997,""" Excellent marks in class
"
35998,"Women do not settle for themselves at work anytime
"
35999,"And importantly, men give themselves the credit of their success, while women credit external factors 
"
36000,"Why is this important?
"
36001,"I wish the answer  was easy
"
36002,"But that's not so easy
"
36003,"Everyone is agreeing because we all know that this is true
"
36004,"There is also a good study that presents this fact well
"
36005,"Here is a famous Heidi Riazen study from Harvard Management Studies division
"
36006,"And he gave the case - both of them - to two groups of students
"
36007,"He changed exactly one word: ""Heidi"" to ""Howard""
"
36008,"But that word really made a huge difference
"
36009,"And he surveyed the students
"
36010,"You can go fishing with him all day
"
36011,"But Heidi cannot say anything specific
"
36012,"She is a little different, she is a little political
"
36013,"You are not sure whether you want to work for her or not
"
36014,"This is a problem
"
36015,"The saddest thing about this is that it is difficult to remember this thing
"
36016,"I said, yes, and she sat down and we talked
"
36017,"She said, "" I learned something today
"
36018,"I learned that I had to raise my hand""
"
36019,"I asked,"" What do you mean?
"
36020,"We need to make women sit on the table
"
36021,"The statistics show this clearly
"
36022,"That's why the women have three or two taks, and the men only one
"
36023,"I think the reasons are very complicated
"
36024,"Everyone is busy, the woman is also busy
"
36025,"And she starts thinking about having a baby
"
36026,"As she starts thinking about it, she starts thinking about making the child a place
"
36027,"How can I add this to all the tasks I've been doing?
"
36028,"It should be fruitful
"
36029,"You should feel that you are leaving a legacy
"
36030,"Do not leave until you really have to
"
36031,"Keep doing your work
"
36032,"My generation, sadly speaking, can not change the number of that high level
"
36033,"That number has not been changing
"
36034,"But I'm optimistic that the future generation can do that
"
36035,"I think that would be a good world
"
36036,"I have two children
"
36037,"Five years old son and two years old daughter
"
36038,"The book is "" Our Choice "" and Al Gore is the writer
"
36039,"The book opens like this
"
36040,"This is the cover
"
36041,"While the earth rotates, we can see our place
"
36042,"Then we can open the book and open lessons to read
"
36043,"Or, the sheet of the book can also be moved from below like this
"
36044,"And if we want to expand a page, it can be opened like this
"
36045,"And if you want to re-read the book, fold it
"
36046,"And this also works the same way
"
36047,"Pick up and open this way
"
36048,"You can also see this photo in interactive maps
"
36049,"Make it big and see where the photo was taken
"
36050,"You can open it
"
36051,"But the best aspects of this book are the interactive data-image
"
36052,"This shows how much air power capabilities are available across America
"
36053,"We can do the same to know about geothermal energy and solar energy
"
36054,"This is one of my favorite things
"
36055,"And when the wind slows down, the added energy goes into the house - the lamps never go out
"
36056,"And this whole book opens not only on iPad but also on iPhone
"
36057,"And works exactly the same in both of them
"
36058,"You can use your fingers to handle any page
"
36059,"Open this
"
36060,"And the first title of this Push Pop Press is Al Gore's ""Our Choice""
"
36061,"Thank you
"
36062,"(Applause) Chris Anderson: It is good
"
36063,"You want to be a publisher yourself or allow it to others
"
36064,"What is its business value?
"
36065,"Does this have anything others can do?
"
36066,"Anderson : So you allow this software's publisher to make more good books like this
"
36067,"(Mike : Yes) 
"
36068,"Thanks Mike, thank you very much
"
36069,"Mike : Thank you
"
36070,"(Anderson: good luck) 
"
36071,"(Applause) Ladies and Gentlemen, gather together
"
36072,"I am going to tell you a story
"
36073,"In the 19th Century, there was 'book' in Germany
"
36074,"At that time, the book was the only medium of storytelling
"
36075,"Books were honorable
"
36076,"Was omnipresent
"
36077,"But it was a bit boring
"
36078,"Because in its 400-year history, the storyteller did not make the book an instrument of story-presentation
"
36079,"But a storyteller came, who changed history
"
36080,"( Music ) was his name Lothar
"
36081,"Lothar Meggendorfer
"
36082,"Lothar stressed and said, "" This is an example ""
"
36083,"He held his pen
"
36084,"He held his scissors
"
36085,"History will know who is Lothar if we stop being complacent
"
36086,"And that went on
"
36087,"And it could not have stopped
"
36088,"And when the Internet came, more interesting times came
"
36089,"( Laughter ) Because now there were several ways for man to present his story
"
36090,"For example, a company reveals its love-story through its own search engine
"
36091,"One Taiwanese studio presents American Politics in 3D
"
36092,"( Laughter ) And a young man shares his father's story through Twitter
"
36093,"And presents his father's activity
"
36094,"Then, all are calm
"
36095,"They look back once
"
36096,"And this was a great achievement
"
36097,"This art of story-presentation always remained the same
"
36098,"Actually, stories were repeating
"
36099,"But the way to people presented their stories was pure and intellectual
"
36100,"And whenever something new happened in story presentation, they remembered the German
"
36101,"So, readers and viewers were always happy
"
36102,"For kids like me, "" Kautoule "" is so often said
"
36103,"Look at yourself : who are responsible?
"
36104,"Adults
"
36105,"What did the children do?
"
36106,"And on the other hand, we children wish for fulfillment of dreams
"
36107,"In different ways, our courage to imagine helps us expand the boundary of the possible
"
36108,"They think only of good ideas
"
36109,"( Laughter ) Our inner awareness need not necessarily align with our inner knowledge
"
36110,"And I think that adults should start learning from kids
"
36111,"The leader of the classroom should not be the teacher only, ordering the student around
"
36112,"Student should teach the teacher
"
36113,"The relationship between children and grownups should be interconnected
"
36114,"If you do not trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?
"
36115,"(Laughter) It is true, no matter what
"
36116,"My own parents also showed pessimism like this
"
36117,"In any case, we did hear that one too, but ""Pioneer Germ Fighters"" was truly great
"
36118,"( Laughter ) I have liked to write since I was four years old
"
36119,"Thank you Bill Gates and thank you mother
"
36120,"Many publishers were not very excited
"
36121,"A publisher of children books talked funny when they said they do not work with kids
"
36122,"Children's publishers do not work with the child
"
36123,"The children grow up and only become adults like yourself
"
36124,"( Laughs ) Just like you, is that true?
"
36125,"Because of this reason, we are not in the stone era now
"
36126,"No, are you kidding?
"
36127,"In fact, we are tomorrow's generation and will steer tomorrow's world
"
36128,"Therefore, today's world needs an opportunity for the new leaders of tomorrow and new ideas
"
36129,"Children need opportunity to lead and succeed
"
36130,"Are you looking forward to helping?
"
36131,"Because the world's problems don't need to be a family's property
"
36132,"Thank you ( Applause ) Thanks
"
36133,"Thank you
"
36134,"We are losing the ability to hear
"
36135,"We spend approximately 60 percent of our time in communication via listening
"
36136,"But we still are not very good at it
"
36137,"We only take in about 25 percent of what we hear
"
36138,"I'm not talking about today, not in this talk, but that's what happens normally
"
36139,"Let us now define hearing as the task of understanding sound
"
36140,"It is a brain process, and it is a hard process
"
36141,"We use some interesting methods for this
"
36142,"We recognize the pattern and separate the message from the noise, especially our names
"
36143,"There is another way to distinguish
"
36144,"If I play this sound for some minutes, you will stop listening carefully
"
36145,"We hear the difference, and we leave the sound that doesn't change
"
36146,"And many types of filters are available
"
36147,"These filters really bring us to what we are wanting to listen to
"
36148,"Many do not know about these filters
"
36149,"I will give an example : Intention is also important for hearing
"
36150,"And now I have not always been able to complete this
"
36151,"( Laughter ) But having such an interest is good for relations
"
36152,"But this is not all
"
36153,"Sound itself installs us in space ( location ) and time
"
36154,"And sound keeps us in time, because time is always contained in sound
"
36155,"I have already said, we are losing the ability to hear
"
36156,"Why did I say that?
"
36157,"There are many reasons behind it
"
36158,"The effort to listen to meditation and goodness has gone
"
36159,"In such a scenario, nobody listens to anyone
"
36160,"We are becoming impatient
"
36161,"We do not like oration, we like interesting explanations
"
36162,"Also the art of conversation is being replaced - dangerously, in my opinion - by personalized communication
"
36163,"We are becoming less sensible
"
36164,"Our media need to shout to get our attention
"
36165,"And this shows that we don't attend to small, tiny, little-discussed topics
"
36166,"It is a serious problem that we're losing the ability to listen
"
36167,"This is absolutely not normal
"
36168,"Because hearing is the way to understanding
"
36169,"Careful listening always assists understanding
"
36170,"Do you wish this?
"
36171,"(Audience: Yes) Good
"
36172,"The first thing is peace
"
36173,"If there is no complete peace, then silence is fine
"
36174,"Second, I call it mixer
"
36175,"Among them, how many channels am I actually listening to
"
36176,"You can also do this in beautiful places, like on the edge of a lake
"
36177,"How many birds can I hear?
"
36178,"Where are they?
"
36179,"And that wave?
"
36180,"This is a good exercise to enhance the quality of hearing
"
36181,"Third, I say rejoice this exercise, 
"
36182,"And this is a beautiful exercise
"
36183,"It is related to enjoying ordinary sounds
"
36184,"Ok, let's take my dryer for example
"
36185,"( Voice of the dryer ) This is Waltz music
"
36186,"One, two, three
"
36187,"One, two, three
"
36188,"One, two, three
"
36189,"I love it
"
36190,"Or should we think about this?
"
36191,"( Grinding coffee beans ) Wow ! Such ordinary sounds are also interesting if paid attention to
"
36192,"I call this invisible instrument
"
36193,"Such sounds are always found around us
"
36194,"Another exercise that can be the most important thing, when you leave one thing
"
36195,"This is also about playing with those filters
"
36196,"If you remember, I initially gave you a filter
"
36197,"These are some hearing situations or positions which you can use
"
36198,"There are many of these
"
36199,"Rejoice in this
"
36200,"It's also interesting
"
36201,"And in the end a brief summary ok?
"
36202,"You can use this for hearing or communication
"
36203,"(RASA) which is a Sanskrit word for juice or essence
"
36204,"Now sound is encouragement for me, this is my life
"
36205,"I have written a book about it
"
36206,"That's why I live solely for hearing
"
36207,"This can be too much for some people
"
36208,"Therefore, our schools must teach listening as a skill
"
36209,"Why is this not done?
"
36210,"It's strange
"
36211,"Thank you for listening to me today
"
36212,"( Applause ) Good morning, Ladies and gentlemen
"
36213,"My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "" Math Magician ""
"
36214,"But before I get started, I have a quick question for the audience
"
36215,"If anyone has a calculator, please raise your hand, please raise your hand
"
36216,"I - Have you raised up your hand?
"
36217,"Ok bring it here, does anybody else have it?
"
36218,"Ok that's good, you, at that corner
"
36219,"( Applause ) okay, good
"
36220,"Ok, a two digit number
"
36221,"Woman : There isn't
"
36222,"( Applause ) Do you want to use a more powerful calculator?
"
36223,"Ok, all right
"
36224,"That is good
"
36225,"I'm giving you a quick multiplication method
"
36226,"For example, the square of 5 is 25 
"
36227,"Arthur Benjamin : 25
"
36228,"OK, please give me a two digit number
"
36229,"Audience : 37 
"
36230,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 37, OK
"
36231,"Audience : 23 
"
36232,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 23, OK
"
36233,"Audience : 59 
"
36234,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 59, OK
"
36235,"And finally
"
36236,"93 
"
36237,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 93
"
36238,"Please could you tell me your answer?
"
36239,"Woman : 1369
"
36240,"3481 
"
36241,"Man : 8649 
"
36242,"Arthur Benjamin : Thank you very much
"
36243,"( Praise ) Ok, now let me go one step further
"
36244,"This time, I will try to figure out the squares of three digit numbers
"
36245,"Only tell me if it is correct
"
36246,"OK, give me a three digit number, sir
"
36247,"Audience : 987 
"
36248,"Arthur Benjamin: Square of 987 9,74,169 
"
36249,"( Laughter ) Yes
"
36250,"Good
"
36251,"Audience : 457 
"
36252,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 457 2,05,849 2,05,849
"
36253,"Yes
"
36254,"OK, next, another three digit number, sir
"
36255,"Audience : 321 
"
36256,"Arthur Benjamin : Square of 321 1,03,041
"
36257,"It is 1,03,041
"
36258,"Is it 5,13,284?
"
36259,"Woman : Yes
"
36260,"Arthur Benjamin : Yes
"
36261,"( Appreciation ) Now I'm trying to take it further
"
36262,"Audience : Nine 
"
36263,"Arthur Benjamin : Nine 
"
36264,"Audience : Seven
"
36265,"Arthur Benjamin : Seven 
"
36266,"Audience : five
"
36267,"Arthur Benjamin : Five
"
36268,"Audience : Eight
"
36269,"9,52,18,564 
"
36270,"Woman : yes
"
36271,"Arthur Benjamin : Thank you very much
"
36272,"( Laughter ) Capacity for only eight places - how much must you hate it, right?
"
36273,"Therefore, since we have reached above our calculator's capabilities - what is that?
"
36274,"Can yours do it - Female : I do not know
"
36275,"Arthur Benjamin : Does your go above?
"
36276,"Audience : I can probably do it
"
36277,"Arthur Benjamin : I'll talk to you later
"
36278,"OK, now let's take the biggest number on this board
"
36279,"8,649 
"
36280,"Could all of you put that number in your calculator?
"
36281,"Seven, and yours?
"
36282,"Woman : Seven 
"
36283,"Arthur Benjamin : Seven
"
36284,"Seven or uncertain
"
36285,"Audience : Yes? Arthur Benjamin : Seven
"
36286,"Say "" No ""
"
36287,"( Laughter ) okay
"
36288,"Woman : Yes
"
36289,"Arthur Benjamin : Very good
"
36290,"Okay good, that's just one
"
36291,"Arthur Benjamin : Just like his
"
36292,"Man : 074044 Arthur Benjamin : I think you left out 3
"
36293,"That is three
"
36294,"Ok good, any 6 among them
"
36295,"Say them in a jumbled order this time, please
"
36296,"Man : 263972
"
36297,"Arthur Benjamin : You have left out 7 right?
"
36298,"Let's hear it for the four of them again
"
36299,"Thank you very much
"
36300,"We had a gentleman who had a 10-digit calculator
"
36301,"Who is he?
"
36302,"Could you stand up?
"
36303,"Ok, gentleman
"
36304,"Here, I will have to apologize to my magician friend Leonard Green
"
36305,"I know that magicians should not teach the secrets of their art to others
"
36306,"I'm telling you how I'm about to do this calculation
"
36307,"I am going to break this calculation in three parts
"
36308,"And I'll all of them, and if we are fortunate, the answer will be found
"
36309,"Let me think for a moment
"
36310,"Thank you
"
36311,"I will explain it in words and later use it on a number
"
36312,"( Laughter ) But my madness definitely has a different way --- Of course, of course
"
36313,"Forgive me
"
36314,"Even if I do something, do not tell me my mistake
"
36315,"OK now, I will start without any more delay
"
36316,"First I will work from the center, I will multiply 57 by 683
"
36317,"38931 times two 77,862
"
36318,"( Appreciation ) Thank you very much
"
36319,"I hope you enjoyed "" Math Magic ""
"
36320,"Thank you
"
36321,"( Praise ) Thanks
"
36322,"It was a normal machine that changed my life
"
36323,"Before that I had never walked out of my house in Malawi
"
36324,"I had never used a computer either
"
36325,"I had not even seen the internet
"
36326,"And that day, I was overwhelmed at the stage
"
36327,"My voice was lost
"
36328,"I felt like vomiting
"
36329,"( Laughter ) I was never surrounded by so many gray and white people
"
36330,"( Laughter ) There was such a story that I wasn't about to tell
"
36331,"But okay, now I'm feeling well
"
36332,"I want to say that story today
"
36333,"We are seven children in our family
"
36334,"All sisters, except me
"
36335,"This is me, with my father, when I was a child
"
36336,"Like others, we used to cultivate maize
"
36337,"One year our luck wasn't very good
"
36338,"In 2001, we had to bear a bad drought
"
36339,"Within five months, the people of Malawi started dying from famine
"
36340,"Our family had only one meal a day, in the evening
"
36341,"That too, only three handfuls of corn for each of us
"
36342,"And that food would go into our body but would not even reach the stomach
"
36343,"In Malawi, you need to pay for secondary education
"
36344,"After the famine, I had to leave the school
"
36345,"I looked at my father, and looked at that dry land
"
36346,"And this was my future, which I could not accept
"
36347,"I was very happy to get into secondary school
"
36348,"So I was detemined to do whatever I could do for education
"
36349,"So I went to the library, I read books, of science, especially physics
"
36350,"I did not know how to read English very well
"
36351,"So I understood the words written with the help of digrams and pictures
"
36352,"A book had given me this divine knowledge in my hand
"
36353,"It was written in it that a windmill could pump water to generate electricity
"
36354,"So I decided to make a windmill for me
"
36355,"But I had no material with me
"
36356,"So I went to the junkyard where I found my stuff
"
36357,"Many people, even my mother, thought I'd lost my mind
"
36358,"( Laughter ) I found a tractor fan speed controller, also found PVC pipe
"
36359,"I made a machine using a bicycle frame and a dynamo from a old bicycle
"
36360,"First one light went up
"
36361,"Another machine pumped water for irrigation
"
36362,"Long lines of people began to appear outside my house ( Laughter ) to charge mobile phones
"
36363,"( Applause ) I could not get rid of them
"
36364,"I had never seen an airplane before
"
36365,"I had never slept at a hotel either
"
36366,"So, that day, on the stage of Arusha, I couldn't speak
"
36367,"I just said, "" I tried, and I made it
"
36368,"Perhaps you will see this on the Internet some day
"
36369,"I tell you, believe in yourself
"
36370,"Whatever happens, do not give up
"
36371,"Thank you ( applause ) As a child I was excited by cars
"
36372,"When I was 18, I lost my best friend in a car accident
"
36373,"Although there were hundreds of teams, none of the cars was capable
"
36374,"So we decided to make a unique automated car at Stanford
"
36375,"We built the hardware ( vehicle parts ) and software ( computer code that runs the car )
"
36376,"We made it learn from us, and left it out in the desert
"
36377,"However, by then I had not saved any lives
"
36378,"We have driven one lakh forty thousand miles
"
36379,"This is a great advancement in the vehicle world
"
36380,"We have driven in cities, cities such as San Francisco
"
36381,"We drove from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1
"
36382,"Actually, we drove one lakh and forty thousand miles and people didn't even notice
"
36383,"In Mountain Roads, Days and Nights, Unique Shared in Lombard Street San Francisco
"
36384,"Sometimes laughter sankinchana our cars so that, minor fractures They can also do
"
36385,"( Video ) people : oh god
"
36386,"Second person : this is going on a bit
"
36387,"Some of these 240 million gallons are petrol fired
"
36388,"Thank you ( Applause ) Imagine a great explosion when you're at 3000 feet high
"
36389,"Imagine the shattered wind of a smoke
"
36390,"I was in a wonderful seat
"
36391,"I was sitting in 1 d (1D)
"
36392,"I was the only man who could talk to the ship's host
"
36393,"I looked forward to seeing them
"
36394,"And they said, "" There is no problem
"
36395,"We must have stuck with a bird
"
36396,"""The driver had rotated the ship, and we were not far away
"
36397,"Manhattan could be seen
"
36398,"After two minutes, three things happen together
"
36399,"The plane struck the ship towards the Hudson River
"
36400,"That was not the regular way
"
36401,"( Laughs ) He closed the engine
"
36402,""" I have the ship - paricarikaharusamga now found that chatting
"
36403,"( Laughs ) I could read his eyes
"
36404,"That was awesome
"
36405,"End of life
"
36406,"Now I am telling you three important things I have learned that day
"
36407,"I learned that everything can be changed completely
"
36408,"Now I do not want to keep anything stuck
"
36409,"And that contingency, that's why my life has really changed
"
36410,"I really feel a repentance
"
36411,"I have a good life
"
36412,"But in my humanity, I also welcome my heart too
"
36413,"And I thought about the relationships with my wife, with my friend, with people
"
36414,"Not all this is appropriate, but very good
"
36415,"I have never fought with my wife in two years
"
36416,"It feels great
"
36417,"I do not want to be right now, just ! I'd like to be happy
"
36418,"I say, "" please take me away ""
"
36419,"I do not want to split it into 20 pieces, as you've seen in that document
"
36420,"When we are coming down, I 've enjoyed having fun
"
36421,"It's not horrible to die
"
36422,"That is exactly how we are preparing for life
"
36423,"But it was very sad
"
36424,"I go ( die ) and not had, and I love my wife
"
36425,"And the pain became a thinking which is, I only want that one
"
36426,"I want to see if my children grow up
"
36427,"About a month later, I had my daughter ( art ) Presentation of
"
36428,"A classroom student, is not such a talented artist ... ... However
"
36429,"But please nasamjhanus guess, how you had come to change
"
36430,"How you improve your relationships and the bad elements in relation to it
"
36431,"And the biggest thing, you are being the best guardian as far as possible
"
36432,"And I asked myself, why
"
36433,"I'm ashamed, I'm sorry
"
36434,"And a question was raised, whether it was me or not
"
36435,"And I decided to check it out
"
36436,"That's why he did not know that his son should listen to it
"
36437,"So my question, why do not we ask for what we need
"
36438,"I know a woman it is not good at work
"
36439,"And he said, "" Why should I thank it, and even if they must take
"
36440,"Now the question comes, why I was stopping that thing
"
36441,"Why other people are stopping?
"
36442,""" And that's why I'm giving you the most relevant facts about me
"
36443,"I'm telling you where I'm insecure
"
36444,"I'm telling you where you need help
"
36445,"And I'm treating you, my inner circle, to me like you're the enemy
"
36446,"Because what you do to do that fact
"
36447,"You can take care of me
"
36448,"You can abuse it or you can really fulfill my needs
"
36449,"So I'm going to challenge you
"
36450,"What do you want to hear?
"
36451,"Go home with your wife and ask her, what she does not need
"
36452,"Go home with your husband - what they want
"
36453,"And that's quite simple
"
36454,"Why do we care about it?
"
36455,"We talk about world peace
"
36456,"How can we get world peace from different cultures, different languages?
"
36457,"I feel that all this house starts at home, under the same roof
"
36458,"So we should start it with our own patio
"
36459,"You may never have told anyone, but you've really done a good job
"
36460,"Thank you
"
36461,"We all have a soul, but do not think that we all get born with them
"
36462,"As children are born, they can not be separated
"
36463,"The fact is that the whole concept slowly loses
"
36464,"That whole childhood is completely different
"
36465,"His pen : Balance uniformity, for example, he goes away separately
"
36466,"Or what we want or should we
"
36467,"I realized it was difficult when I realized that this whole behavior could increase the spirit of soul and identity
"
36468,"The intimate identity of the world has been repeatedly rejected
"
36469,"My father's own place of Colonel
"
36470,"White men and mother mother Zimbabwe
"
36471,"Is it true?
"
36472,"Our family was interested in everything
"
36473,"But the fact that this is the poor child born in the family
"
36474,"For five years, I know I could not be involved in the society
"
36475,"I am an atheist, unbelievable
"
36476,"There were black children whereas the Catholic stools of the surrounding families were white children
"
36477,"This was the significance of the importance
"
36478,"Hair was not right
"
36479,"It was not fairly a black child
"
36480,"My definition was created, I never thought of anything else that was not my social status
"
36481,"When sixteen were Oreo, I got a chance, I started to play the movie
"
36482,"There is a lack of words and they are happy to boast
"
36483,"Happy time
"
36484,""" He said "" Tandy, that's wrong
"
36485,"No
"
36486,"The definition of my soul on the other hand
"
36487,"Made of fear and ignorance
"
36488,"This has caused me bememia disease and I need therapeutic advice
"
36489,"Thirdly I still believe my soul is mine
"
36490,"The value of the soul is above the value of all other things
"
36491,"Otherwise, what else should I say
"
36492,"Anyway
"
36493,"Yasasaga caravan began to pit and began to understand, my work even without the bbaharalai
"
36494,"But I'm not surprised
"
36495,"In the bedroom, I have a soul
"
36496,"Honor the mind and perform the work of the soul
"
36497,"Time and practice, I learned to live, more than a jibbish

36498,"And, you can do that if, abisvasilo heritage progress janerahecha
"
36499,"We are not only united
"
36500,"Our sinful minds are not even mixed, but they are like a male lifestyle
"
36501,"It only told us from birth
"
36502,"That's what I'm thinking of
"
36503,"My little idea that helps to open that lock is that - sleep
"
36504,"( Laughter ) ( Tally ) This type - A women 's room
"
36505,"This is the bedroom of unmarried women
"
36506,"And I know about the importance of sleep from my experiences
"
36507,"More than two years ago, I was feeling tired due to tiredness
"
36508,"""( Laughter ) Now, here's a kind of insult, always - the desire to be a winner
"
36509,"And we have many factors that can sink our ship
"
36510,"Thank you
"
36511,"This is the thing I talked about
"
36512,"( Laughter ) Look, Chinese characters for picnic area
"
36513,"In other words, Chris says that, I would have been wrong the past five years I sat thinking baremai
"
36514,"Human race, overall, is not faultless, okay
"
36515,"And of course, we are currently alive
"
36516,"We currently go to the meeting, we celebrate the present, we go to the election and vote for the present
"
36517,"I think this is the problem
"
36518,"Otherwise, how is this problem?
"
36519,"So why do we find it in the illusion of self-determination?
"
36520,"Worse, dead lifetime, thumbs down shame
"
36521,"L, the best, the very best
"
36522,"Worse, shame thambsadauna - Thank you for the answer utkristha
"
36523,"But these are the answers to another question
"
36524,"But doing wrong, I do not compare anything, I compare and show you
"
36525,"But if the thing goes away, the cottage goes and goes on the run
"
36526,"Fun things - six years old when - kayotile what manhood is fine yourself this
"
36527,"He is running but when he sees it himself, he is in the air

36528,"It seems that it itself falls in the air
"
36529,"So I want to correct what I have done for a while
"
36530,"It seems like it was perfectly correct in the wrong ( confused )
"
36531,"It's not mine
"
36532,"The child is a sinner
"
36533,"This dumb kid, sorry : who never, never does his homework

36539,"Beth Israel is in Boston
"
36540,"This is Howard's teaching hospital - a good hospital in the country
"
36541,"Well, she was taken to the operation room
"
36542,"Ancestry innocent doctor did his work - rear wound was sent to rest and rest
"
36543,"So far it was all right
"
36544,"But when he gets up and looks at this, then why "" Flame "" put it on the wrong side
"
36545,""" He's fine. ""
"
36546,"He had a wrong part of surgery
"
36547,"The doctor did the big operation at the left side when the problem was on the right
"
36548,"While expressing this incident, the Deputy Head of the Bethel of Health Israel said something interesting
"
36549,"He said ' For whatever reason, the surgeon, the doctor thought that, he was the right side of the patient
"
36550,"That's why this is a great problem
"
36551,"But it is also a big social problem
"
36552,"Thinking of a moment, what is the meaning of being correct?
"
36553,"This is the true truth that you believe
"
36554,"No one disagrees with us before we mess up, we assume they're ignorant
"
36555,"This is an accident
"
36556,"We want all of them to look at the same window and see exactly that
"
36557,"This is not true, and if it were, life would be incredibly boring
"
36558,"The brain's heart is not that you see the world as it is
"
36559,"This is why you have to see a world that is not
"
36560,"And, in fact, we are wrong
"
36561,"1200 years ago Desartus said a famous thing "" I think and I am
"
36562,"This is an essential thing to be a human being to us
"
36563,"Because, like God, we do not know what happens
"
36564,"And instead of other animals, we would like to know the same thing
"
36565,"And if I think of earlier, I went and lost
"
36566,"I'm wrong about the wrong thing
"
36567,"I started watching this anyway
"
36568,"And what happened
"
36569,"A few months later, I got an opportunity to interview Ara Glass, who used to do that program
"
36570,"I kept this thing to him, and he said, "" This is not the case
"
36571,"What she said : ' I thought of this, but it was different
"
36572,""" And the thing is,"" says Ira Glass, "" but you want it to its original
"
36573,"""The remaining things, viewers, listeners, readers, in all, we all tear this story with fun.
"
36574,"Now when we arrive in our story, we may be in error
"
36575,"But, of course, our story is similar, because we live like that
"
36576,"Thinking about being unrealistic, it seems to be another way
"
36577,"Talk to something else

36578,"Talk again again

36595,"During my visit, I have found very fortunate in getting Britain's most powerful women
"
36596,"The woman who is making a road for you
"
36597,"Here I want to say that we have a lot of equality
"
36598,"My story is nothing like this, so I can get it here
"
36599,"I was raised in prosperity and convenience, nor was there any category in society
"
36600,"I grew up in the west part of Chicago
"
36601,"Which is the real part of Chicago
"
36602,"And I was the product of labor - class society
"
36603,"My ancestors worked for the city throughout the world
"
36604,"My mother was a housewife
"
36605,"And she sat in the house and cared for me and my grand brother

36607,"My father had "" Multiple Scroborosis "" in his life's most important step

36612,"In my life, they taught me very important things
"
36613,"They taught me what kind of a relationship would be between women and men
"
36614,"They taught me what a rare marriage would be
"
36615,"They taught me how to become a father and how to raise the family
"
36616,"These were the qualities I discovered in my husband, Barack Obama
"
36617,"And in this "" date "" I would have to go to a social gathering with him
"
36618,"( Laughter ) I know, how romantic
"
36619,"( Laughter ) But when we met, Barack was a social worker

36620,"He worked to find jobs, and struggling - neighboring source - means the provision of

36621,"As he spoke to the citizens of that society, he spoke about two thoughts
"
36622,"He "" This is what the world is now,"" and "" The world as it should be "" talked about
"
36623,"And I talk about this election campaign throughout the world
"
36624,"He said that, for many times, we accept the distance between these two thoughts
"
36625,"We know the nature and the law and the opportunity
"
36626,"We all know

36627,"You are the only women who will make the same as this world

36633,"They did not allow any obstacle
"
36634,"By the same way, these women removed many obstacles
"
36635,"And if you have a good education, you too can take your own risk

36636,"Please remember it

36692,"But I know if I have seen many changes
"
36693,"There is no one before
"
36694,"That's a little earlier
"
36695,"Still, the British Council has appointed 25 other teachers including me
"
36696,"And we were the first non - Muslims to teach at Kubat's official school
"
36697,"And also the benefit of the UK was the property of that attractive oil
"
36698,"So that
"
36699,"Now this school is not limited to a foreign language course
"
36700,"And not just single jurisdiction in the UK
"
36701,"It is now a fantasy for every English - speaking country of the world
"
36702,"And why not
"
36703,"So naturally everyone wants to learn English
"
36704,"But if you are not a native speaker, you must pass an exam
"
36705,"Now, it is appropriate to prohibit a student only on the basis of linguistic ability
"
36706,"Maybe you have a computer scientist who is very intelligent
"
36707,"For example, the need for the student to be a lawyer, whereas the language knowledge required
"
36708,"Well, I do not think so
"
36709,"We always speak English teachers
"
36710,"We keep a sign of a ban, and stop them from their way
"
36711,"Now they can not fulfill their dream, unless they learn English
"
36712,"I do not think so
"
36713,"But we're actually doing that
"
36714,"We have been English teachers
"
36715,"You must satisfy us that your English is good
"
36716,"Now it can be dangerous to give the society a lot of power to the small community
"
36717,"That barrier can be even more universal
"
36718,"So that
"
36719,"It nourishes the needs of English
"
36720,"And it keeps growing like that
"
36721,"I ask you, what is the translation?
"
36722,"Listen to the Golden Age of Islam, at that time there were many translations
"
36723,"Then the light of darkness in Europe's dark era took place
"
36724,"I can not misunderstood
"
36725,"All English Teachers Sir, I am not against English education
"
36726,"I am happy to, we have a world - language
"
36727,"That's what we need now
"
36728,"But I am against it as an inspector
"
36729,"Do we want to be limited to 600 languages ​​by making the main language of English or Chinese
"
36730,"We need more than that
"
36731,"Where would we have to buy
"
36732,"The present system now identifies the intellectuals with the knowledge of English that is voluntary
"
36733,"Take the einstein as an example
"
36734,"He was regarded as a cure for the school because he, in fact, had a healthy sleeping condition
"
36735,"But the luck of the world, he did not have to pass the English exam
"
36736,"For 1 9 64 until they tophela, American angrejiko test, the start had
"
36737,"It's widespread now
"
36738,"Now there are some of the English exams
"
36739,"And every year, millions of students give that test
"
36740,"We are immediately prohibiting them
"
36741,"They want their children to give the best opportunity to life
"
36742,"And to do all this, they require Western education
"
36743,"Because, too, good opportunities go to educate from western universities, which I previously said
"
36744,"It's a cyclical thing
"
36745,"So now let me tell the story of two scientists, two English scientists
"
36746,"They were using a biological experiment before the animals and behind the paws
"
36747,"They could not get the squeezing they wanted
"
36748,"Oops, the problem was solved
"
36749,"If you can not get a thought, you're surprised
"
36750,"My daughter, from Kuwait, came to England
"
36751,"She did not know in the science and mathematics Arabic language
"
36752,"That Arabic medium was a school
"
36753,"He had to do it in his primary school
"
36754,"And they were the fastest in all their subjects
"
36755,"So, he invented a free running solar cell
"
36756,"Now we should not keep ourselves and them in the middle
"
36757,"Call the diversity
"
36758,"Think about your language
"
36759,"Use it to spread great ideas
"
36760,"( Applause ) Kindly thank you very much
"
36761,"My interest in this, and my love has begun suddenly
"
36762,"And till today I have not left that feeling
"
36763,"First of all I came from a circle of drawings
"
36764,"But it shows the state of our knowledge about the universe
"
36765,"And the physicians came and started using some time in the late 1980s
"
36766,"And in the first century of the century, the last ones used to operate in a candle candle when working here
"
36767,"And today, quizzed sees it, the quarry in, Off miles in land
"
36768,"It is the world's best underground laboratory
"
36769,"And, in many cases, these are also exploring the thermos
"
36770,"But, in excess of a very large amount, water is made for it to be made
"
36771,"Thousands of megawatts of water - for the possibility of finding water related to water - saturated glands
"
36772,"And where does the water flow?
"
36773,"Oh, I'm in touch with the Russians as you like
"
36774,"That is the reservoir bacterium
"
36775,"This is the world's best rhythm
"
36776,"800 km long
"
36777,"In maximum positions of 40 to 50 kilometers wide, one to two kilometer serious
"
36778,"That is at the peak of the Baikal lake Siberian winter
"
36779,"This reservoir is full of frozen
"
36780,"Thus, these rusiharule him are working
"
36781,"Because the concrete him to step dvimasa complete remains and ciraharule
"
36782,"And AI can imagine, tyamham a sea - like the water in the bottom of the trend
"
36783,"And they devote their lives for the sake of this work
"
36784,"To present you an illustration, they have more than 20 million more than 20 years
"
36785,"This is a very harsh condition
"
36786,"They work in insufficient income
"
36787,"This toilet in the ground is covered with a chambered cell
"
36788,"And that's primary, but they do this every year
"
36789,"Those great devices called Siberia to see
"
36790,"Extravagant audiences perform these such materials by astronomers - showing little lack of imagination
"
36791,"I can say the truth, the other device will be a big décor
"
36792,"Otherwise, this is an extraordinary composition of the engineer
"
36793,"These four 8 . 2 minutes away
"
36794,"Such mirrors are cultivated by these mirrors
"
36795,"After all, I'll bring you to the Antarctica ( the southern continent of the earth ) .
"
36796,"I want to spend more time in this part of the world
"
36797,"This is the limit of the universe
"
36798,"Some of the most amazing experiments, some of the most extreme experiments, antarktikama is being
"
36799,"And this is us in the hit game named Antiochica
"
36800,"Now we are going to sit
"
36801,""" And so we will bring McMardo
"
36802,"And this is the scene that will automatically swear to you in McMordo
"
36803,"And you have seen that hard to see here
"
36804,"This is an extraordinary place
"
36805,"This is McMardo
"
36806,"I started using a similar device
"
36807,"It is a space ray that was launched in the upper part of the parallel 40 kilometers in Tangta
"
36808,"If I want to imagine what you think, it's two loads
"
36809,"And behind the volcanoes, there are glaciers at the top of the top
"
36810,"This process takes an estimated two hours
"
36811,"And inconvenient, at any time we can adjust and make changes
"
36812,"For example, yamham they are putting down vayukumbhako clothing, rests ultimately filled hiliyam
"
36813,"This special venture, as it should be two-dimensional weight, is a huge venture.
"
36814,"The only garment is twice in weight
"
36815,"For reducing the weight, it is so rare that the excessive amount of food being absorbed
"
36816,"They nurture and re-saves tons must
"
36817,"And keep in the vessel
"
36818,"Such loyalty is in these people
"
36819,"Yunna Vyukumama is filled with Heelam, and you can see it is a grand view.
"
36820,"Yehna is that scene when Vyukumar and Vardyaya left - are there
"
36821,"Anil Orthanswami - I want to leave you with two pictures
"
36822,"It is an Observatory organized by the elite Himalayas of India
"
36823,"And one thing I can do is, if you have a watcher on the hand side, otherwise
"
36824,"And there is a 400-year-old Buddhist Vihar away from there alone
"
36825,"View Buddhist monastery near y is the
"
36826,"I am surprised to see this symptom as seen by humanity in two subjects.
"
36827,"One is observing the external world-wide, and the next is solving our inner self-esteem.
"
36828,"And both of them need peace if there is any kind of peace
"
36829,"Thank you
"
36830,"Good morning
"
36831,"What is it
"
36832,"All setbacks, not so
"
36833,"All these things made me wonder and surprised
"
36834,"In fact, I'm leaving
"
36835,"Its variety and its type only
"
36836,"And nothing is known about how it can be done
"
36837,"I am interested in education - in fact, what I feel is that everyone is interested in education
"
36838,"You do not have it
"
36839,"I feel like this
"
36840,"( Laughs ) No one asks you
"
36841,"And you do not ask anyone again, eagerly
"
36842,"That's wonderful for me
"
36843,""" And you say that you work in education, you will see the color of their face lost
"
36844,"They talk like this, "" O God,"" knows, "" Why I
"
36845,"My weekend is in a dinner
"
36846,"""( Laughter ) But if you ask about their education, they will put you in control
"
36847,"Because it is such a thing that touches man, not so
"
36848,"Religion, and money and other things
"
36849,"♫ I have great interest in education, and I think we all have
"
36850,"However, we should be studying them for them
"
36851,"So, this guesslessness, I think, is amazing
"
36852,"I mean, Sirena last night can be, not so
"
36853,"Look at what he did to do so
"
36854,"And she is an exception, but I do not think, just say, the whole childhood exception
"
36855,"An extraordinary person who you have seen there is a talent
"
36856,"And if my disagreement is, all the children have a great talent
"
36857,"€ and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly gardinchaum
"
36858,"So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity
"
36859,"( Applause ) Thank you
"
36860,"In fact, that's what I mean
"
36861,"Thank you very much
"
36862,"( Laughter ) After that, now 15 minutes left
"
36863,"Yes, I was born ... no
"
36864,""" And that child says,"" I am making a picture of God
"
36865,""" And the teachers say,"" Nobody knows what God is like
"
36866,"""¼ And that child says,"" Everyone will know after a minute
"
36867,"( Laughter ) If it's a matter of fact, whereverever he goes, he was four years old
"
36868,"He was on the playtime
"
36869,"You remember that story
"
36870,"No, that was too long
"
36871,"It was a tale
"
36872,"Mel Gibson has made this series
"
36873,"♫ You might have seen : "" Netvity 2
"
36874,""" But James received the role of Joseph, who made us thrilled
"
36875,"£ We had taken it as a key role
"
36876,"They come with gifts, and they bring gold, francans and mirrors
"
36877,"It really happened
"
36878,""" And he said,"" Oh, why
"
36879,"Something went wrong
"
36880,""" They switched, that was it
"
36881,""" And the second boy said,"" I have brought a miracle here
"
36882,""" And the third boy said,"" Freight sent
"
36883,"""( Laughter ) If these similarities are in common, children take an opportunity
"
36884,"Even if they do not know anything, they do something
"
36885,"Yes no
"
36886,"They are not afraid to be wrong
"
36887,"If you're not ready to be wrong
"
36888,"And when the children be adults, most kids have lost that capacity
"
36889,"They are afraid of being wrong
"
36890,"And, we also use our companies
"
36891,"® We look badly to the mistakes
"
36892,"And as a result, we are teaching people beyond their creative ability
"
36893,"Picasso once said this
"
36894,"He said that all the children are born when they are born
"
36895,"The problem is that the artists continue to grow even when we grow up
"
36896,"I believe that it is complete, we will not grow into creativity, we grow out of it
"
36897,"Above all, we are educated out of it
"
36898,"So why it is
"
36899,"I lived at Stratford - on - Avon just five years ago
"
36900,"In fact, we moved to Los Angeles from Stratford
"
36901,"You can guess how easy this change might have been
"
36902,"You're surprised
"
36903,"I was going
"
36904,"You do not think of Shakespeare having a father, think so
"
36905,"Think so
"
36906,"Because you do not think Shakespeare as a child, yes
"
36907,"Shakespeare of seven years
"
36908,"I never thought of this
"
36909,"My opinion, he was once seven years old
"
36910,"He was in somebody's English class, not so
"
36911,"It might have seemed so daunting
"
36912,"( Laughter ) "" Should work harder
"
36913,"And do not talk about that
"
36914,"It dumps everyone
"
36915,"My son did not want to come
"
36916,"I have two children
"
36917,"He is 21 years old, my daughter is 16 years old
"
36918,"He did not want to come to Los Angeles
"
36919,"She liked this, but she was a girlfriend in the UK
"
36920,"Sera, her girlfriend's life
"
36921,"It was the only way to know the wool wool
"
36922,"In any place
"
36923,"It does not matter where you go
"
36924,"You might think it would be, but it is not
"
36925,"The upper level consists of mathematics and languages, and the humanities, and art are the ones below
"
36926,"Anywhere in the earth
"
36927,"And often : most of all passive, kalaharubhitra are even more layers
"
36928,"¼ Arts and music are generally given the highest status in schools, then plays and plays
"
36929,"Why
"
36930,"Why not
"
36931,"I think this is more important
"
36932,"♫ I think mathematics are very important, but dance is equally similar
"
36933,"If you give children, you should not dance at all times
"
36934,"We all have the body, though
"
36935,"I do not know anything
"
36936,"And then we focus on the heads of the wool
"
36937,"And in a stretch of detail
"
36938,"To be the only ones who come in the front
"
36939,"And I was also the same
"
36940,"Wools are just one type of life, ® another type of life
"
36941,"But they are rather curious, and I love to say this to them
"
36942,"Woolen bush over there, and a little bit
"
36943,"A type of fleece, literally, is bodyless
"
36944,"They look upon their body as a form of vehicle linchana, not so
"
36945,"( Laughter ) This is a way to take her head to meetings
"
36946,"Our education is now based on the concept of advanced education
"
36947,"And this is one reason
"
36948,"At that time all those things were started to bring about the needs of industrialization
"
36949,"So this level system is based on two ideas
"
36950,"First, the most important topics for work are above
"
36951,"Yes no
"
36952,"Do not go to music, you will not be a musician
"
36953,"Artists do not mind, you do not have to be an artist
"
36954,"Sweet Tips - Now, Incredibly Wrong
"
36955,"This whole world is caught in a revolution
"
36956,"And I think we can not go on that road
"
36957,"According to UNESCO, in the coming 30 years, more than a person will be graduated from education till date
"
36958,"Unfortunately, titles are not worth anything
"
36959,"Yes no
"
36960,"When I was a student, you had a degree in degree
"
36961,"If you did not have a job, it would be just about you
"
36962,"And to me, directly over, didnt want
"
36963,"This is a process of acceleration
"
36964,"And it shows that the entire education method is letting us fall into love
"
36965,"We should all reconsider our intellectual approaches
"
36966,"We know three things about wisdom
"
36967,"First, its diversity
"
36968,"We look at the world in every way we experience it
"
36969,"We think visually, we think in volume, we think in beauty
"
36970,"We think in abstract form, we think in practice
"
36971,"Second, intelligence is dynamic
"
36972,"The brain cells are not divided
"
36973,"These women are slightly thicker
"
36974,"Because you are so, no
"
36975,"There is a band of research, but I know this from my own life
"
36976,"If my wife is cooking a meal at home - which is not often, thankfully
"
36977,"I say, "" Terry, please, I'm cooking egg here
"
36978,"Not wait
"
36979,"She remembers that old man
"
36980,"""( Laughter ) And the third thing about wisdom, it is different
"
36981,"People have attracted me from how to reach there
"
36982,"Someone has heard it
"
36983,"Wool is a choreographer and everyone knows her work
"
36984,"She's "" kyatsa "" and "" phyantama of the Opera "" banaeki with child
"
36985,"It's so funny
"
36986,"I lived in the Royal Ballet Committee in Velayat
"
36987,"You know
"
36988,""" She could not concentrate, she was fidgeting
"
36989,"I think they might now have been called ADHD
"
36990,"Yes no
"
36991,"But it is about 1930, and at that time ADHD was not invented
"
36992,"That was not an available stage at that time
"
36993,"( Laughs ) Nobody knew about it
"
36994,"Anyway, she sanctuary show specialist
"
36995,""" He said,"" It's waiting, we'll come, it's not too late
"
36996,""" And the wools left the wool
"
36997,"But when the wools went out of the room, he opened the radio on his desk
"
36998,"And when they went out of the room, he said to the mother of her mother, "" Stand and watch the wool
"
36999,""" And they left the room, she said, her feet, and the music began to
"
37000,"Take wool to the dance school
"
37001,""" I said,"" and what happened
"
37002,""" Wool said,"" sent
"
37003,"I can not tell you how fun it was
"
37004,"We went to that room and there was a lot of people like me
"
37005,"People who are not able to stay steady
"
37006,"People who want to think
"
37007,""" Those who want to think
"
37008,"They're nacthe ballet, tap nacthe, Jazz nacthe, modern nacthe, contemporary nacthe
"
37009,"If someone else had been treated, he would have treated her and she would have asked him to keep quiet
"
37010,"And in the future, it will not give us work
"
37011,"We should reconsider the basic principles in which we are teaching our children
"
37012,"If all humans from the earth beat, all the creatures will be planted within 50 years
"
37013,""" And wool is right
"
37014,"Ted respects the gift of human imagination
"
37015,"- Anyway - we have this future, but they will
"
37016,"And our job is to help the wool do something on it

37017,"Thank you very much
"
37018,"When I was Oxford's student here in 1970, I did not expect hope of the gospel
"
37019,"Population growth was unbearable
"
37020,"The hunger could not be removed
"
37021,"The cancer spread due to chemicals in the environment was reducing our lives

37022,"In the wilderness there was a famine

37025,"And, the winter atom could have finished us

37029,"One per cent increase in food production per person

37032,"This graph shows the size of the population by the size of the point
"
37033,"And the graph's graph shows the total subsidy output per person

37034,"In other words, it is important to understand how to handle ideas

37035,"These two are real items

37036,"The other is naturally a mouse mouse
"
37037,"These two are exactly the same size and exactly the same

37038,"I tried to find out what I am, but it's almost impossible
"
37039,"Because of that, they are made to put them in the hands of both men
"
37040,"These two techniques are to be done
"
37041,"Finally, their equality is not so interesting
"
37042,"It only shows that both of them were made to put them in the hands of man only
"
37043,"These differences arouse my interest
"
37044,"Homosexuals made such content up to 30, 000
"
37045,"There was no progress, there was no wonder
"
37046,"This is an extraordinary event, but true
"
37047,"When the item of the right is not functioning in five years
"
37048,"And there is another difference, that is - the left object is made of the same material
"
37049,"The right item is made of a mixture of different substances, silicon and metal and plastic
"
37050,"All of these ideas have been combined in this technology
"
37051,"They all come together

37053,"Khare, it uses sexual reproduction

37054,"There should be another end to stay in existence

37055,"But in gender issues, it is possible to accept both types of transitions from different species

37060,"You can teach them to exchange at least one in the laboratory
"
37061,"And its effect can be seen in other animals
"
37062,"But they can never exchange one item with another item
"
37063,"'' ( Laughter ) You can adopt rituals without exchange
"
37064,"Sex can be used without rituals
"
37065,"Chimpanzee, like wild whale, have the rites
"
37066,"They teach tradition to each other, which transfers from their parents
"
37067,"Chimpanzians teach each other how to stir up stones
"
37068,"If there is no reason for the reason, ideas will not be changed
"
37069,"Champions have many rites of different flags
"
37070,"They do not have an exchange of ideas
"
37071,"And which exchange increases the level of life
"
37072,"Khare, answering his reply in 1817, David Ricardo gave
"
37073,"Aadhaar makes a spear in four hours and makes a spoon in three hours
"
37074,"Azley creates one spoon in a gut and two o'clock in a row
"
37075,"So both work is skilled than Adam
"
37076,"He does not have any need for AIDS
"
37077,"He can make himself a weapon for himself
"
37078,"And as much as they do, they also save a lot of time
"
37079,"Then the income from that family goes on increasing
"
37080,"Adam and Aj both saved one hour time
"
37081,"Save time is going to be prosperous while completing the needs
"
37082,"If you had to start from scratch, first you go out
"
37083,"One wolf should be searched and cut
"
37084,"And its fat should be removed
"
37085,"Fat should be boiled
"
37086,"And made its habit
"
37087,"Many such conflicts have to be done
"
37088,"How much time does it take to you?
"
37089,"Takes too much
"
37090,"Just half a second
"
37091,"By 1950, due to the medical wages to engage in such light, it had to work eight seconds
"
37092,"And you achieved the prosperity of half and a half in comparison to 1950
"
37093,"Because in the past seven seconds you can do something else
"
37094,"Or you can spend some other item or service
"
37095,"On the other hand, when the drug addict was not able to buy a candle in 1880
"
37096,"Making that stone tool made for its own work
"
37097,"It was the self-reliance of that time
"
37098,"But today we would like to be unproductive
"
37099,"But someone else's right was made for me
"
37100,"How many other people will be together?
"
37101,"Ten
"
37102,"Hundred
"
37103,"Thousands
"
37104,"I think millions of people will be built together
"
37105,"All of them are working to prepare a mouse for us
"
37106,"Thus our society is working
"
37107,"And this is such a specialty that we have received as a human race
"
37108,"First of all, some wealthy means that he had servants with him
"
37109,"Similarly, people were called rich
"
37110,"Giving others work
"
37111,"Lewie had fourteen employers
"
37112,"They made this cowboy cloth
"
37113,"( Laughter ) and made her hair like this
"
37114,"For them, 498 workers worked together for dinner
"
37115,"They are in Bistro, Cafés, and Restaurants throughout Paris
"
37116,"You may also have other animals working for each other
"
37117,"Such as the balls
"
37118,"If the workers work for their queen, the queen is for their workers
"
37119,"A group does not have to work for another group
"
37120,"Because of the reason there is labor division for reproduction
"
37121,"Meaning, they get the breeding of breeding
"
37122,"The queen does all this
"
37123,"But in our species, we do not want to do so
"
37124,"Breeding is the one we want to do for ourselves
"
37125,"( Laughter ) Brussels, we do not make breeding queen
"
37126,"( Lock ) So, when this habit started
"
37127,"And since this is not happening
"
37128,"And what does that mean?
"
37129,"So, I think, its oldest version is probably a sexual division of labor
"
37130,"But for that I have no evidence
"
37131,"It's not that easy
"
37132,"But there are differences in special roles between men and women
"
37133,"And the good side of that system is that it benefits both of them
"
37134,"And she does not have to go to play a very tired hunt
"
37135,"And the man knows that he does not have to go to eat himself for getting fluid
"
37136,"Thus, by gender separation of work, men and women raise their standard of life
"
37137,"When this process started
"
37138,"We do not know, but Neighbors probably did not
"
37139,"They were very helpful species
"
37140,"They were very intelligent
"
37141,"Their brains on average, by the end, this room was bigger than
"
37142,"They were imaginative
"
37143,"They bury the dead
"
37144,"It seems that they had spoken skills
"
37145,"They were talented
"
37146,"I have not tried to insult the Neighbors
"
37147,"But there is no evidence of sexuality of any labor
"
37148,"There is no evidence that women gather food
"
37149,"It seems that women used to play hunting
"
37150,"And there is no such evidence that there is a difference between the group
"
37151,"For example, there is a place in Caesare, where such Neighborhood tools do not get
"
37152,"These tools are made from one of the stones found around it
"
37153,"The same valley there are modern human remains from about the same time, 30, 000 years ago,
"
37154,"The business started 10 times before farming
"
37155,"But people think that business is modern
"
37156,"The exchange between the community is coming millions of years
"
37157,"And that people were exchanging between groups - provide evidence started
"
37158,"And it leads to expertise
"
37159,"They traded it with their neighbors with stuff like String Barb
"
37160,"As a result, those stone tools spread across most of Australia
"
37161,"The contents of long-distance trade is an indication, not migration
"
37162,"The answer is that it does not slow down the development of technology, but it really has its own inferiority
"
37163,"An example of this is Tazmania
"
37164,"We have many things in our pockets 10, 00 years later, could make you think
"
37165,"The same islands, the same people, but Tierra del Fiogo did not happen
"
37166,"And for 10, 000 years there was a Greater Warrier trade deal
"
37167,"But the Tajmenians were generally not contacted
"
37168,"In case of the stone ax, the man who made it knew how to make
"
37169,"But who knows how to make a mouse mouse?
"
37170,"Nobody, literally nobody knows him
"
37171,"It is no one going to make computer icons in the world
"
37172,"I'm really serious
"
37173,"The computer mouse company does not know how to make a mouse
"
37174,"He only knows how to use the company
"
37175,"We all know little but nobody has any info
"
37176,"And they do not know how to shape the tree and make such an object
"
37177,"It's not like this language
"
37178,"By means of language, we exchange each other's ideas that can understand
"
37179,"But by means of technology we can work out of our potential in reality
"
37180,"We have reached an extraordinary level beyond human brain's ability
"
37181,"This is a completely disputed thing
"
37182,"So we have created something called 'communal mind'
"
37183,"We're just a branch of that network
"
37184,"We are the little nerves of that brain
"
37185,"Still, bad events happen
"
37186,"And in the future, in such a way, we will truly impose things that make terror
"
37187,"War will be
"
37188,"Will be depressed
"
37189,"There will be natural disasters
"
37190,"Dreadful events will fall in this century, I'm absolutely convinced
"
37191,"Thank you
"
37192,"And it will be easy to implement and less expensive
"
37193,"Our mathematical course is based on the number and number of algebraic
"
37194,"And then we all learn that everything goes ahead on one topic
"
37195,"And what is the condition of that pyramid?
"
37196,"Potentials and statistics
"
37197,"( Applause ) I mean, I wrong nasocnusa
"
37198,"Statistics are an important topic
"
37199,"This is a great yield of human brain
"
37200,"The rules of nature are written in the language of the Catholic
"
37201,"Yes no
"
37202,"It's a risk
"
37203,"This is the return
"
37204,"It's random
"
37205,"To understand this fact
"
37206,"My opinion, probability and statistics, this is the mathematics of games and gambling
"
37207,"This is an analysis of the tendencies
"
37208,"This is a prediction of the future
"
37209,"See, the digital analog has changed to digital
"
37210,"And this is the time to change our mathematics course from Digital to Digital
"
37211,"More ancient, everlasting mathematics from modern, disciplined mathematics
"
37212,"Unmatched mathematics, seriality, fact - mathematics, probability, and statistics
"
37213,"And this is my intention
"
37214,"Thank you very much
"
37215,"( Applause ) Peter Pan is the dream of mankind to fly
"
37216,"The birds are very fast
"
37217,"They fly, but not by any rotating device, just by wandering the wings
"
37218,"What else would be better than using it as a model
"
37219,"What was a special point here was to make it completely light
"
37220,"So that if it falls, it should not hurt anyone
"
37221,"Why are we doing all this?
"
37222,"So now I want you to stop your chairs and protect your head
"
37223,"So that we should try once, this smart bird is blowing
"
37224,"Thank you
"
37225,"( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Now we, SmartBird
"
37226,"It is without skin ( shell )
"
37227,"Its wing is about two meters
"
37228,"The length is one meter and 6 inches, and weighs, only 450 grams
"
37229,"And it's all made of Caravan Fighter
"
37230,"There are three solution sensors inside the motor, so that we can know exactly what the wings are
"
37231,"Now we down - beat up and said ... it is more likely to fly
"
37232,"We have to turn it up, take it up and bring it down
"
37233,"We have a split wing
"
37234,"The upper wings can be raised due to split punctuations, and gives the power to dump down the bottom
"
37235,"In addition, we've thought how can we measure the aerodynamic efficiency that
"
37236,"We have electrical - mechanical efficiency ( electro-mechanical ) knowledge of which we can use to measure the aerodynamic efficiency
"
37237,"That's why, it arises from the passive radar to the active radar, 
"
37238,"rises from 30 percent to 80 percent
"
37239,"Another thing we should do is, we should keep the entire structure controlled and operated
"
37240,"Thank you
"
37241,"( Applause ) Bruno Gissani : Markus, I think we should fly it once again
"
37242,"This could be the only way to talk to your children anymore
"
37243,"We are discovering this to be 11 times more effective than email
"
37244,"We have also received unexpected results
"
37245,"That is, we are also getting answers to our text
"
37246,"Like these : "" I do not want to go to school today
"
37247,"And I started again an hour ago "" or,"" He does not stop raping me
"
37248,""" He warns not to tell anyone
"
37249,"That's my dad
"
37250,"Are you there
"
37251,"This latest text we got is about a real event
"
37252,"And yes, we were ready to hear the sender of the texts
"
37253,"I will not forget the day I received the text
"
37254,"So let's think, text hotline, it's powerful
"
37255,"It's fast, absolutely confidential
"
37256,"No one can listen to you wherever you sit, you can text
"
37257,"And it'll happen immediately
"
37258,"From this, we can counsel and recommend millions of teenagers
"
37259,"Which is a great thing
"
37260,"But what makes this behavior important is the data obtained
"
37261,"I want to stop such bad deeds
"
37262,"So, let us consider the police for example
"
37263,"There is a special feature in New York City
"
37264,"The police there started this work
"
37265,"Police's investigation used to only be guesswork
"
37266,"And later they started analyzing crime statistics
"
37267,"Therefore, consider the statistics coming out of the text hotline activated during crises
"
37268,"Or there may be some evidence regarding any incident
"
37269,"You can make a complete law of understanding, school policies can be well-informed
"
37270,"What's happening in your school?
"
37271,"Thank you
"
37272,"( Applause )
