0,"Present Economic Conditions
"
1,"Historical Background
"
2,"The history of planned process of economic development in Nepal is short. Before 1951, some development activities were undertaken but their scope was very limited.
"
3,"Among them were limited programmes to develop power and drinking water facilities in Kathmandu, health programmes in a few districts, some schools, and a college, a commercial bank, a few roads and some small-scale irrigation works.
"
4,"The abolition of slavery in 1925 was the most significant social measure.
"
5,"But as a result of various political and geographic conditions, Nepal remained isolated behind other countries in its social and economic development.
"
6,"However, the economic stimulus of World War II led to the establishment of the first modern industrial units Nepal.
"
7,"Many of these failed to survive the immediate post-war period because of poor management and lack of technical knowledge.
"
8,"Only very recently attention has been given to feasibility studies and the other prerequisites of sound industrial development.
"
9,"Even after the political changes of 1951-52 relatively little progress was made.
"
10,"The difficulties of changing the political and administrative structure were largely responsible.
"
11,"First Five Year Plan (First Plan)
"
12,"Serious efforts to plan economic development took place after the establishment of a Planning Board in 1955.
"
13,"The First Five Year Plan, prepared by the Board, covered the 1956-61 periods.
"
14,"Because of the Bird’s limited knowledge and experience, there were serious shortcomings in the Plan itself. Despite this, some significant results were achieved, although expenditures were only Rs. 210 millions or Rs. 42 millions annually.
"
15,"But the Plan did stimulate public interest in, and support of planning. Government was made aware of the requirement for planned development.
"
16,"There was significant progress in the fields of education and health. Overall, however, the plan made little4 headway creating the necessary base for economic development.
"
17,"The Three Year Plan (Second Plan)
"
18,"A significant result of the First Plan was the recognition of the conditions required for successful planning and project implementation.
"
19,"It was realized that a plan formulated without detailed knowledge of actual conditions and the development potential of the several was of limited usefulness.
"
20,"A plan must, moreover, take full account of administrative relationships and the limited financial and other resources available.
"
21,"At the time the Second Plan was prepared, knowledge of economic conditions in Nepal was still extremely limited.
"
22,"In the absence of survey and studies of natural recourses, agricultural output national income and other economic variables, existing economic conditions could not be accurately ascertained.
"
23,"It was not possible, therefore, to set overall targets and goals in quantitative terms.
"
24,"The absence in data also prevented the formulation of a long range perspective planning within which the Second Plan was to operate.
"
25,"Recognizing these limitations, Second Plan Sectoral targets were fixed in terms of Nepal’s ability to finance and imp lement the development programme.
"
26,"Because of the existing shortcomings, the Second Plan gave priority to activities which would the base for more comprehensive future plans.
"
27,"Emphasis was given to the collection of data on economic conditions organizational reform and improvement, and the development of the economic infrastructure.
"
28,"The planned outlay in the public sector was virtually achieved.
"
29,"Table 1 gives the financial allocations and actual expenditures during the Second Plan.
"
30,"Expenditures incurred for the forest resources and botanical surveys, mineral exploration, surveys of irrigation and power potential and in the transport sector are in the respective departmental totals.
"
31,"In the second year, development budget expenditures rose to Rs 147 million, In the final year expenditures were Rs 180 million, excluding projects supported by Indian Aid, which were added in th4 supplementary budget.
"
32,"In addition to administrative reform, land reforms were started during the Second Plan. Their purpose is to modernize agriculture and provide incentives for increasing production.
"
33,"Significant progress has been achieved in industry, transport and power.
"
34,"The present position of the several sectors of the economy is given in the following sections:
"
35,"Agriculture
"
36,"Nepal’s agricultural output depends very heavily on climatic conditions.
"
37,"During 1963-64, the second year of the Second Plan, whether conditions adversely affected agricultural output.
"
38,"In the first and third years, weather conditions were normal and did not adversely affect production.
"
39,"It is estimated, however, that agricultural output increased over the plan period as a whole as a result of programmes undertaken His Majesty’s Government.
"
40,"The expansion of existing units and the establishment of new factories have encouraged cash crop production with a resultant increase in output.
"
41,"Although still far from adequate, the agricultural extension services have has positive effects. These include improved seed, implements, fertilizers and plant protection facilities.
"
42,"Irrigation has also been provided on an additional 100,000 areas. Institutional improvements have also been made.
"
43,"The Agricultural Reorganization and the Cooperative Bank Acts of 1962 were steps in this direction.
"
44,"The Agricultural Reorganization Act was implemented in selected gram panchyats of Jhapa, Palpa and Chitwan dis tricts.
"
45,"With the establishment of new units and the modernization and expansion of existing plants, industrial output in selected sectors has increased significantly as shown in Table 3(A).
"
46,"The Census of 1961-62 showed an increase in the literary rate to 8.9 percent.
"
47,"Malaria eradication work has been completed the central zone of Nepal in which 2, 400,000 persons reside.
"
48,"Eradication work is underway in the eastern zone covering 1,300,000 persons. Smallpox and leprosy control programmes has been started.
"
49,"The maternity and child care programme has been explained. Efforts have been made to improve sanitary conditions.
"
50,"International Resources
"
51,"In the last few years, there has been considerable progress in the mobilization of international resources.
"
52,"Governmental revenue which was Rs 90 million in 1961-62 has increased to Rs 158 million by 1064-65.
"
53,"Because of the expansion of industrial activity and higher income levels, income from customs and excise taxes rose considerably.
"
54,"Receipts from land revenue rose with as upward adjustment of tax rates.
"
55,"Direct taxes have also been imposed and the receipts are rising. The establishment of new government corporations and better management of existing units have added to the divided income of government.
"
56,"As a result of this striking expansion of governmental receipts, more internal resources have been made available for the development budget.
"
57,"In the Second Plan period, this trend was reversed. The Plan called for financing Rs 670 million of which 110 million or 17 percent of proposed expenditures were to be met by the internal resources.
"
58,"The actual contribution amounted to 24 percent of the total. Trade
"
59,"During the Second Plan, efforts were made to diversify trade. It is not possible to measure the success of these efforts since the required data for recent years are not yet available.
"
60,"In 1957-58, imports were recorded at Rs 160 million and by 1960-61 they had increased to Rs 400 million.
"
61,"Although the trade is still predominantly with India, trade with other countries is gradually increasing.
"
62,"This is below the per capita incomes of India, Pakistan and Ceylon which, in 1963, were estimated at $73, $74 and $ 137 respectively.
"
63,"In the United States, at the other extreme, per capita income is over $2,500.
"
64,"Ninety-three percent of the population of Nepal is dependent on agriculture which contributes 65 percent of gross domestic product.
"
65,"The industrial sector is just getting started and contributes a small fraction of total output. Its activities are confined mostly to processing agricultural products.
"
66,"Transport, communication and power facilities are inadequate to meet Nepal’s needs.
"
67,"The literacy rate is among the lowest in world and life expectancy at birth is 32 years.
"
68,"The low income level of Nepal indicates that savings arte also very small.
"
69,"This limits the volume of investments which can be financed internally and makes it even more imperative that the limited resources be used productively for the benefit of the nation. 9The export figures do not measure actual exports since raw jute, timber, leather and other products which did not have to pay an export tax were not recorded.
"
70,"In addition, taxable commodities were, to some extent, smuggled across the border and thus not recorded. The Central Bureau of Statistics estimates the exports of 1961-65 at Rs 4000.0 million instead of the recorded Rs. 265 millions.
"
71,"These are licensing rather those actual values. Actual figures are undoubtedly smaller.
"
72,"CHAPTER II Objectives and Priorities
"
73,"As mentioned earlier, income levels are among the lowest in the world.
"
74,"1. The aim of the State shall be to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as just social order which brings about harmony in the national life by integrating and consolidating the interests of different classes and professions from a comprehensive national outlook.
"
75,"2. Towards the fulfillment of the objectives laid down in clause (1) such policy, in particular, shall be followed as a result of which- a. All citizens may have equal opportunity and facility to develop their personality and to make economic progress ;
"
76,"b. Citizens may have reasonable and adequate means of livelihood ; and
"
77,"c. 	The ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so regulated as may bring about equitable distribution of wealth and as may best sub serve the common good and also afford reasonable protection and encouragement to private enterprise in the allotted sectors of industry and trade.
"
78,"The above objectives are intended to promote the welfare of the people of Nepal in the process of economic development. To increase total output is not enough.
"
79,"It is also necessary to distribute the output equitably. Although the primary objectives must of necessity be to increase productivity and total output, the distribution aspect must also be considered by a nation concerned with the welfare of its citizens.
"
80,"The Panchayat System and National Development
"
81,"For rapid economic development the social and political structure must stimulated rather than hinder the growth process.
"
82,"As Nepal’s own experience since 1960 has shown, political stability is one necessary condi tion.
"
83,"In the social field, all citizens should have an opportunity to develop their capacities to the fullest extent and be able to secure gainful and productive employment.
"
84,"To accomplish the desired results, conscription for work and distinction based upon caste, religion and sex must be eliminated.
"
85,"Education, medical care employment opportunity must be made available to all.
"
86,"To achieve the goal of social justice, steps should be taken to eliminate gradually the concentration of wealth in a small group and to reduce the income gap between the few and the many.
"
87,"Care must be taken, however to ensure that adequate incentives for work and investment are also provided.
"
88,"To accomplish this, new organizations need to be established and operated under necessary rules and regulations.
"
89,"Political Stability, the elimination of socially undesirable systems, and changes in organizational structure are imperative for the success of any development plan.
"
90,"There must also be a gradual evolution of the political, social and economic system in response to changing conditions to allow the necessary flexibility while adhering to the basic social objectives.
"
91,"Such a system must be close to the people and responsive to their needs. Its scope should not be restrictive but should cover all aspects of social and economic activities.
"
92,"The panchayat system is the medium through which the constitutional objectives are to be met.
"
93,"More specifically, the panchayat structure designed to create the institutional arrangements necessary for the political, social and economic growth of the nation.
"
94,"It will involve the people at all levels of administrative and executive action within the country.
"
95,"In view of the basic objectives, all important activities must be undertaken with in the framework of the panchyat system. His Majesty’s Government has committed itself to a decentralization policy which will further strength the zonal, district and village panchayats.
"
96,"The Preamble to the Constitution states-  Whereas it is desirable in the best interest and for the full development of the Kingdom of Nepal and of the Nepalese people to conduct the government of the country in consonance with the popular will, and originating from the very base with the active cooperation of the whole people’ it embodies the4 principles of decentralization.
"
97,"The panchayat system is not only a framework but also the means for the implementation of the development effort.
"
98,"The success of any nation-wide development plan depends upon the active support and cooperation of the people.
"
99,"The contribution of the panchayat system in mobilizing local resources and labour has also been important.
"
100,"The Long Run Perspective
"
101,"In order to plan effectively many countries prepare long term perspective plan covering up to 25 years.
"
102,"Nepal cannot prepare such a long term plan because of the lack of necessary statistical data.
"
103,"These programme are, a part of a continuing process reflecting past activities as well as future plans. Therefore, long term goals for each sector are essential.
"
104,"These are particularly necessary in such as power, transport and education. A long term target of doubting national income in fifteen years has been set.
"
105,"This may appear ambitious in terms of past achievements. The target appears feasible, however, on the basis of the experience of other developing nations.
"
106,"In view of the present level of utilization of available resources, such a rate of growth neither does nor appears feasible in the near future.
"
107,"The rate can, however, be expected to rise above it over the fifteen year period.
"
108,"The rate of population increase for the past few years in estimated at two per cent and is expected to remain at this during the Third Plan.
"
109,"It is estimated to rise to 2.2 per cent in the following five years and then to 2.4 per cent. Based upon the population projection, per capita real income will increase 62 per cent by 1980.
"
110,"As a result of steps taken during the Second Plan, it is now possible to determine long term targets in  some sectors of the economy.
"
111,"The development of transport and power are two basis requirements for economic growth.
"
112,"Roads are the primary means of transport on Nepal. A long term road development programme has been prepared which calls for 2,500 miles of road construction over the twenty year.
"
113,"Free and compulsory primary education will be provided nationally by 1980 in accordance with UNESCO targets.
"
114,"In some sectors, major projects will take relative long periods of time to complete.
"
115,"One major hydro-electric project on the Karnali, for example, may take eight to ten years.
"
116,"To coordinate these several programmes, a long term perspective plan is needed.
"
117,"Third Plan Targets
"
118,"The national income target of the Third Plan is to achieve a total increase of 19 per cent.
"
119,"This will give a nine per cent increase in per cent income over the plan period, assuming a population growth of two per cent per year.
"
120,"This is not ambitious in terms of doubting income over the next plan periods, but it does appear ambitious in the light of the present absorptive capacity of the economy.
"
121,"The Plan calls for total expenditure of Rs 2,500 million in public and private sectors.
"
122,"Of this, Rs 520 million will be spent on the private sector, Rs 240 million by district and village panchayats on district and local development activity, as distinguished from public sector expenditures by the central government. During the Second Plan, development expenditures in the public sector averaged Rs 200 million per year as compared with the projected Third Plan average of Ts 350 million.
"
123,"In the last year of the Second Plan, however, expenditures in the public sector alone amounted to Rs 260 million.
"
124,"The Plan must, however, encompass programmes designed to meet immediate problems as well as those which are essential to future growth.
"
125,"The experience of India demonstrates that rapid economic growth cannot occur unless agriculture is properly developed.
"
126,"Unless food production expands, price rise and inflationary pressures becomes acute. Institutional Reform
"
127,"One of the objectives of economic development in Nepal is to move labour out of agriculture in to other productive activities. A rapid expansion of agricultural output will enable Nepal to overcome her present dependence on agriculture.
"
128,"It is necessary not only to increase investment on agriculture but also to expand investment opportunities outside of agriculture. The feudalistic system in the rural areas if Nepal must be brought to an end.
"
129,"The economic condition of the tiller is adversely affected by insecurity of tenure, high rents and high interest rates. A primary objective of the Third Plan, therefore, is to improve the condition of the tiller by effectively implementing the land reform programme.
"
130,"Economic Infrastructure It is also essential to develop transportation and power.
"
131,"Their development will increase agricultural output and lead to a more efficient market system. Transport difficulties have been among the primary barriers to development, particularly of the hill region of Nepal.
"
132,"Only the first steps have yet been taken in transport and power development. Industrial Development
"
133,"Industrialization is an essential component of economic growth. However, development of industries requires a reasonable level of agricultural and infrastructure development.
"
134,"The Plan, therefore, aims at developing industries wherever feasible. Industrial development can occur in both the public and the private sector.
"
135,"In the light of the limited resources available, it is not desirable to restrict the development to one sector. Special efforts will be made in the public sector to ensure the establishment of basic and essential industries.
"
136,"Financial and technical assistance is being made available to stimulate development. Foreign Trade
"
137,"International trade occupies an increasingly important role as economic growth and development take place. Associated with the growth is a rising demand for capital goods and raw materials which must be important.
"
138,"Therefore, Nepal will have to earn and spend more foreign exchange, particularly convertible currencies, in the years ahead. India is Nepal’s primary and predominant trading partner.
"
139,"Nepal’s exports are prese ntly limited to a few products.
"
140,"In order to diversify trade, agriculture and industry must be developed to produce additional goods for export. In addition, new market for Nepal’s exports must be developed.
"
141,"Social justice depends upon the allocation of the benefits of economic growth to large numbers of people. If the benefits are secured only by a small group, the active support and cooperation of the people cannot be secured.
"
142,"The land reform programme is one major measure designed to improve the economic condition of the people of Nepal.
"
143,"The progressive direct taxes which have been introduced are also designed to distribute benefits more widely.
"
144,"The Mulki Ain, a legal code designed to eliminate individual distinctions based upon caste and religious distinctions, was adopted in the Second Plan and will be supported vigorously in the Third Plan.
"
145,"Social justice covers more than an equitable distinction of income and land ownership.
"
146,"Education, health and other social services also help raise the living condition of the people.
"
147,"The manner in which these measures will be stressed will be outlined in later sections.
"
148,"To the extent that the panchayat system is effectively utilized, facilities will be made available to the largest number of people.
"
149,"By initiating programmes in regions, the benefits would also be dispersed geographically.
"
150,"Over-emphasis on equitable income distribution may discourage potential entrepreneurs and restrict the economic growth of the nation.
"
151,"Emphasis must be placed on expanding opportunities for all citizens of Nepal.
"
152,"Priorities of the Plan Because of the widespread demands on scarce resources, priorities must be established among the many possible activities.
"
153,"The planning process itself involves as determination of priorities which is affected by existing conditions and the necessity of emphasizing those activities which will most effectively stimulate further development. Agriculture plays a particularly important role in the initial stages of economic development.
"
154,"It provides the foods requirements for industrial workers, the raw materials for industry, and earns foreign exchange with which to by needed imports.
"
155,"Moreover, in Nepal, ninety per cent of the people are dependent upon agriculture for their live hood.
"
156,"An agricultural revolution is a necessary condition for rapid growth. To achieve this, not only should modern agricultural techniques be made available but the benefits of increased production should accrue to the cultivator.
"
157,"The Land Reform programme is designed to accomplish the latter goal. But this alone cannot improve the economic condition of the tiller.
"
158,"Production loans, cottage industry development, cooperative credit, marketing societies, and resettlement programmes are also needed.
"
159,"In the light of these considerations, the highest priority has been given to agricultural development.
"
160,"Agricultural development depends also on the improvement and expansion of marketing facilities.
"
161,"These facilities are also needed to integrate the social and economic activities of the nation.
"
162,"The Third Plan calls for expenditures of Rs 2,500 million which will increase total gross domestic product by 19 per cent.
"
163,"Plan expenditures by 1969-70 will be some nine per cent of gross domestic product as compared to an estimated six per cent in 1964-65.
"
164,"Total development expenditures are expected to rise from Rs 324 million in the last year of the Second Plan to Rs 600 million by 1969-70.1
"
165,"It should be noted that not all expenditures can be classified as investment.
"
166,"Some expenditure will meet recurring costs- e.g. allocations to education, publicly, broadcasting, malaria eradication, health, and various training programmes.
"
167,"A substantial proportion of Plan expenditures, however, will finance construction and the purchase of equipment.
"
168,"Some sixty per cent of Plan expenditures will be covered by foreign assistance.
"
169,"A detailed analysis of financial sources in given later, but the proportion of foreign assistance in the Third Plan will be lower than in the Second. Nepal’s absorptive capacity has been raising ray.
"
170,"This is seen from the expansion of expenditures over the Second Plan period and the fact that the Second Plan expenditures target has been achieved.
"
171,"The increasing availability of trained manpower, timely procurement and distribution of building materials, and the improvement of administrative efficiency are all important factors contributing to this result.
"
172,"If absorptive capacity rises further as expected, the Plan targets are clearly achievable. Public Sector Expenditures
"
173,"Out of the Rs 2.500 million to be spent during the Third Plan, the public, panchayat and private sector allocations are Rs 1,740, Rs 240 and Rs 520 million respectively.
"
174,"The public sector allocation includes development target expenditures, commodity assistance and equipment and supplies provided directly by aid - giving nations.2 In the past few years, development expenditures have been rising rapidly.
"
175,"In 1962-63, Rs 70 million were spent out of the development budget.
"
176,"By 1964-65, it rose to RS 235 million. In addition, there are direct expenditures by the aid-giving nations on aided projects.
"
177,"Spending capacity must be increased further in view of Nepal’s needs and aspirations.
"
178,"The Third Plan calls for public sector development expenditures of Rs 310 million in the first year rising to Rs 390 million by 1969- 70.
"
179,"In the light of past performances such an increase in absorptive capacity is feasible.
"
180,"Panchayat Sector Expenditures
"
181,"The mobilization of labour and other resources through the panchayat system is extremely important for social and economic development.
"
182,"As income levels rise over time, the panchayat capacity to mobilize resources will increase.
"
183,"In addition, greater authority will be given to the panchayat organizations in accord with the decentralization programme.
"
184,"Major responsibilities will be given to the zonal, district and gram panchayat.
"
185,"The compulsory savings scheme instituted under the land reform programme will be an important source of funds for the panchayats.
"
186,"The term “public sector” normally should also include what we have identified as the “ panchayat sector,” but since greater emphasis will be given to development activity conducted by district and local panchayats, this portion of the total has been identified separately. irrigation, education, building construction, roads, cottage industries and drinking water.
"
187,"Since the capital, technical skill, and foreign exchange requirements for these are activities relatively limited, they can be effectively handled by the panchayats.
"
188,"The Plan calls for Rs 520 million of investment expenditures in the private sector.
"
189,"In the absence of data, it is difficult to estimate the allocation to the several fields of the private sector.
"
190,"Most private investment presently takes place in agriculture, industry and housing. Since the government will be responsible for the major part of investment in other sectors such as transport, health and education, private investment expenditures have been estimated for industry and housing.
"
191,"These come to Rs 50 million for 1964-65.
"
192,"Two factors should be noted. First, these expenditures include funds to be mage available to the private sector by the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, the Cooperative Bank, the Nepal Bank Ltd., and other government-financed credit institutions.
"
193,"These cover industry, agriculture, transport and housing.
"
194,"Cultivators’ investment on a self -help basis is not included. Some of the factors affecting industrial development are mentioned in the industrial policy section.
"
195,"Among these are the degrees of tariff protection, tax policy, import licensing, foreign exchange facilities, etc.
"
196,"These factors will be studied and improved as necessary to provide a suitable climate for long term growth and to facilities expansion.
"
197,"Allocation of Plan Expenditures
"
198,"The allocation of Plan expenditures, based upon the objective and priorities as discussed earlier, and presented in Table 5.
"
199,"The largest proportion of resources goes into development of transport, communication, and power.
"
200,"This takes 37 per cent of total Plan expenditures. Transport and power development is highly capital intensive and requires large amounts of funds.
"
201,"Thus, this sector is allocated more funds than agriculture, which is given top priority.
"
202,"Moreover, the amount of funds allocated to agriculture is not the full measure of expenditures which affect agricultural development.
"
203,"Development of industry, transport and power also benefit and stimulate agricultural expansion.
"
204,"Not all of the private sector investment in agriculture is included in the Plan.
"
205,"Construction and improvement of field channels and drainage facilities, terracing and clearance, undertaken by cultivators, are not included. All of these factors must be kept in mind in assessing the allocation.
"
206,"In the private sector, expenditures are allocated to industry, agriculture, transport and housing.
"
207,"Governmental resources have been concentrated more on expanding economic overhead in the form of transport, power and communication which will stimulate agriculture, industry, and transport in the private sector.
"
208,"Basis for Sectoral Expenditures
"
209,"The amounts allocated to each sector were determined on the basis of projects and activities to be undertaken by each department.
"
210,"These allocations do not necessarily cover the full cost of such activities.
"
211,"In some instances, the projects will extend into the next plan period.
"
212,"In other cases, allocations were made without the technical studies which were needed for detailed cost estimates. This applies more to major projects involving construction than to other types of programmes.
"
213,"Therefore, as more data become available, adjustments will be necessary within the overall Plan total.
"
214,"Availability of Resources
"
215,"Money is not the only resources required for the implementation of the Third Plan.
"
216,"In addition, trained manpower, construction materials, and other resources are necessary.
"
217,"In view of the present state of limited scarce resources, it is necessary to exploit one of the existing projects to the maximum rather than merely constructing new projects.
"
218,"The nation’s production can be raised without investing any additional capital, if the available roads, bridges, schools, hospital and so forth are utilized fully.
"
219,"So, the present Plan has laid an emphasis upon the maintenance programme in order to have optimum benefit out of them.
"
220,"In Table 6, public sector expenditures are allocated among various departmental categories. The sector totals are the same as those given in column one of Table 5.
"
221,"Development Policy Plan programmes must be based upon plan objectives and the policies to be implemented in the several sectors.
"
222,"Theses policies reflect not only activities to be undertaken by government but also assistance and facilities to be made available to the private sector.
"
223,"This will help clarify the relationship between public and private components of the economy. Another purpose of governmental policy formulation is to eliminate barriers to successful development.
"
224,"The programmes incorporated in the Plan are based upon certain principles and polices. The more important policies concerning agriculture, industry, trade and prices are discussed below:
"
225,"Industrial Policy
"
226,"Industrialization plays a vital role in accelerating economic development.
"
227,"His Majesty’s Government is committed to supporting further development of the industrial sector.
"
228,"Rather than getting involved in arguments about the relative roles of the private and public sectors. His Majesty’s Government has taken a pragmatic view.
"
229,"In order to promote the industrial development in the private sector, His Majesty’s Government will give special attention to available economic overheads such as transport and power. Government will provide financial and technical assistance to private development.
"
230,"Measures will be taken, however, to ensure that such development will be beneficial to the nation.
"
231,"Where the needs are greater that can be handled by the private sector, public sector units will be established. Because public resources are limited, they must be direct to such areas as roads, power and social services.
"
232,"Thus emphasis is placed upon private sector for development. Government will, however, provide necessary assistance.
"
233,"Some of the facilities and concessions presently available are:
"
234,"1. Income Tax Exemption- New industries are not subject to income tax for ten years after the commencement of business.
"
235,"Thereafter, exemption may be granted wholly or partially as considered desirable. 2. Export Duty Exemption- New and old firms undertaking exports may be gives full or partial import duty exemption for specified periods.
"
236,"3. Import Duty Exemption- Imports of machinery spare parts, and raw materials may be given full or partial import duty exemption for specified periods.
"
237,"4. Foreign Exchange - Foreign exchange will be made available to purchase machinery, spare parts and raw materials which are unavailable, or available in inadequate quantities in Nepal and for the remuneration of foreign technicians.
"
238,"6. Repatriation of Capital - Foreign investors making investments in scarce currency will be allowed to repatriate their investment.
"
239,"During any single year, such investors will be allowed foreign exchange for repatriation up to 25 per cent of their investment.
"
240,"7. Acquisition of Land and Timber- Assistance will be provided in land acquisition and timber needed for construction will be sold at a 15 per cent discount from the auction rate.
"
241,"For industries which are considered essential to Nepal, His Majesty’s Government will consider the provision of additional facilities as required.
"
242,"In addition, loans and technical assistance are available though the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation.
"
243,"Trade Policy
"
244,"In the modern age, no country can develop without trade relations with other countries.
"
245,"Developing nations must import technical skills and capital equipment.
"
246,"Development has, therefore, been associated historical with an increasing volume of trade. The limited market in a small country like Nepal indicates that industrial development will also depend upon exports.
"
247,"The present relatively low level of trade which Nepal has with other countries is a reflection of its low income level and underdevelopment.
"
248,"Steps will be taken during the Third Plan to expand and diversify trade. The main objectives of Nepal’s trade policy will be to increase the volume of exports, the variety of products exported and to diversify markets.
"
249,"Nepal’s imports are bound to rise in the years ahead as income levels rise and development activities expand.
"
250,"Recent trade data have yet to be tabulated and published.
"
251,"Therefore, estimates of import -export levels over the Third plan period cannot be formulated.
"
252,"However, it is apparent that export earnings must increase to finance the large volume of imports needed. Production of import substitutes alone will not meet the problem.
"
253,"Special attention will, therefore be given to export expansion.
"
254,"Export expansion hinges upon an increas e in the production of export item.
"
255,"Since Nepal’s exports consist mainly of agricultural products, especially food grains, an increase in agricultural production is essential.
"
256,"Just to increase the quantity of exports, however, will not be sufficient. The variety of goods exports must also be increased.
"
257,"Export dependence upon only a few agricultural products makes the nation overly subject to external price fluctuations.
"
258,"Efforts will also be made to diversify the direction of trade.
"
259,"At present Nepal’s trade is almost wholly with India and insignificant with other countries. With accelerated development, imports of machinery and construction materials from overseas will increase.
"
260,"To finance these purchases, increased exports outside of India are essential.
"
261,"To encourage this increase provision has been made for the exports to utilize a portion of the earning to import goods into Nepal.
"
262,"In addition, steps will be taken to make Nepalese products more competitive in the world market by reducing costs and ensuring quality standards.
"
263,"Imports into Nepal from overseas countries are subject to import licensing. This has been imposed to restrict the import of luxury goods.
"
264,"The available funds are needed to purchase essential development goods. Foreign exchange transaction with overseas countries will continue to be subject to licensing during the Third Plan.
"
265,"Changes will be made in customs tariffs as required to restrict luxury good imports.
"
266,"Policy will be implemented to ensure that export-import activities are primarily for the nations benefited.
"
267,"If necessary, export- import activities will also be undertaken by government.
"
268,"The National Trading Corporation will play an important role in this filed.
"
269,"The recently organized Food Corporation also has a significant role in this connection.
"
270,"Agricultural Policy
"
271,"The Plan has placed primary emphasis upon the accelerated development of agriculture. In the past, the absence of an overall programme for agriculture has hindered development.
"
272,"In the Third Plan, emphasis is placed upon an integrated agricultural development programme based upon specific objectives rather than piecemeal projects and programmes. There are two factors involved in agricultural development.
"
273,"The first in the expansion of agricultural output.
"
274,"The second is the transfer of human and capital resources from agriculture to other sectors.
"
275,"These two components are closely related.
"
276,"The expansion of agricultural output depends upon the adoption of new and improved agricultural techniques. The improvement of techniques will not only stimulate increased production but facilities the transfer of resources to other sectors.
"
277,"At present, the Nepalese economy is heavily based upon agriculture.
"
278,"In the long run, this dependence must be reduced as economic growth is historically associated with population depends on agriculture and 65 per cent of gross domestic products come from this sector, Nepal must depend heavily on this sector for the generation of additional savings.
"
279,"Because of the major differences in topography, soils and climate conditions in Nepal, no single pattern of agricultural activity is feasible.
"
280,"In the hills and mountain areas, cultivable land and irrigation facilities are limited by the terrain.
"
281,"Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on animal husbandry and fruit production.
"
282,"Food grains and cash crops are more suitable for the Terai.
"
283,"When the tempo of development activities expands and urbanization proceeds rapidly food grain demand will also rise.
"
284,"In the next few years, food grains will still be the primary export. Therefore, major emphasis will be given on the expansion of food grain production, because it can be raised in a short period of time with improved techniques.
"
285,"Cultivators must be given every incentive to increase output. Improved seeds, fertilizers and better implements need to be made available at the proper times and places and at reasonable prices.
"
286,"To meet these requirements, an Agricultural Supply Corporation will be established.
"
287,"Cultivators will also need credit to purchase the required inputs.
"
288,"New cooperative societies will be established and existing ones will be strengthened to provide production loans.
"
289,"The Cooperative Bank will make funds available to these societies.
"
290,"Medium and long term loans to individual cultivators will also be made available. An agricultural Bank also will be established to provide loans to individual cultivators at low interest rate.
"
291,"The agricultural extension programme will be expanded and further strengthened. The land reform programme designed to protect tenancy rights and to prevent exploitation by landlords, merchants and money lenders will be completed during the Third Plan.
"
292,"Prices received by the cultivators will affect their willingness to apply more modern techniques. Steps will be taken to ensure incentive price and to improve marketing efficiency.
"
293,"Landlords who do not cultivate their own lands will be encouraged to put their resources to the industrial sector.
"
294,"To reduce the pressure of population on land in the hill regions, some of the present population will be resettled in the Terai and Inner Terai.
"
295,"Efforts will be made to encourage the movement of labour from agriculture to the construction and industrial sectors.
"
296,"Price Policy
"
297,"Over the past few years, consumer goods prices have been rising. The experience of other developing nations indicates that prices tend to rise in the process of development.
"
298,"However, a rapid rate of increase will adversely affect development effort by hitting fixed income groups and stimulating speculative rather that productive use of saving.
"
299,"And, it will be more difficult to achieve the Plan targets due to the rise in the costs.
"
300,"Every effort will therefore, be made to maintain a stable price level, particularly for construction materials and daily necessities.
"
301,"The following are a list of factors responsible for rising in Nepal:
"
302,"1. Due to rising development expenditures, Government expenditures during the Second Plan have more than doubled.
"
303,"In a low income country like Nepal, a large par of any increase in income is spent on the purchase of food and other essential consumer goods.
"
304,"This tends to push the prices of these goods upward.
"
305,"Prices are also under pressure due to increasing population.
"
306,"2. Because of the open border with India, Indian prices, particularly of food grains, affect prices in Nepal.
"
307,"Indian food prices have been rising rapidly over the past few years.
"
308,"In addition, since most consumer goods are imported from India, inflationary pressures in India affect the prices of these goods in Nepal.
"
309,"3. Because of underdeveloped transport, isolated areas may suffer shortages and price increase although the nation as s whole has a surplus.
"
310,"4. The rapid expansion of money supply in Nepal is another factor.
"
311,"An increase in money supply is necessary to accommodate increased output and the monetization of the economy but the present rate of expansion is in excess of the rate required for the above purposes.
"
312,"Money supply has almost doubted over the Three Year Plan period.
"
313,"To s tabilize prices within the plan period the following measures will be taken:
"
314,"Regional Development Policy Accelerated economic development requires the implementation of proper policies and institutional improvements on a national scale.
"
315,"Geographic concentration of Plan activities will not necessarily be conductive to overall national development.
"
316,"Development should take into account regionally available resources and productive factors.
"
317,"The natural and human resources available in the several regions of Nepal vary both in variety and quantity.
"
318,"Even those natural resources which have been located and identified differ in accessibility and case of development.
"
319,"Other cooperating factors are also required.
"
320,"For example transport, communication, power and trained personnel are required for the development of available natural resources.
"
321,"On this basis, Nepal can be divided into three regions: the Karnali, the Koshi, and the Gandak-Bagmati river basins.
"
322,"At present, development activities are centered in the Gandk-Bagmati region. However, there are a number of development activities underway in theKoshi region. The Karnli region is in the preliminary stage of development.
"
323,"2. The second basis of regional differentiation is topography, and on this basis the country can be divided into three regions— the Terai, the Hills, and the Himalyan belt.
"
324,"Most of the development activity is concentrated in the Terai and a small part of the hill area.
"
325,"This reflects the relative development of the economic overhead facilities in the several areas.
"
326,"In the agricultural sector, food grains and cash crops will be emphasized in the Terai, horticulture in the hills, and anima l husbandry in the northernmost region. Industrial development in the hills is possible but will occur slowly because of transport and power limitations.
"
327,"Health, education, cottage industries and agricultural extension services, to mention a few, are activities with a national scope and will be expanded in all regions.
"
328,"The Panchayat system has encouraged the undertaking of local improvement works thought the nation.
"
329,"These have helped to maintain and stimulate regionally balanced development.
"
330,"The decentralization programme will give further encouragement to local initiative and interest for local and regional development.
"
331,"CHAPTER V
"
332,"Financing the Plan Since 1956, when His Majesty’s Government introduced the First Plan, the absorptive capacity of the economy has been increasing.
"
333,"The financial and physical resources required for development have expanded correspondingly.
"
334,"In the past, the absorptive capacity was less than the amount of financial resources available.
"
335,"During the past few years however, spending capacity has increased to such an extent that the availability of financial resources has become a limiting factor. The rate of investment in Nepal is very low.
"
336,"During the Third Plan it is expected to rise nine per cent of gross domestic product. This is still low compared to other developing nations, but in the light of past experience, it appears reasonable.
"
337,"Even so, greater effort in both the public and private sectors will be required to achieve such a goal.
"
338,"A Review of the Second Plan
"
339,"During the Second Plan, some Rs 600 million was estimated to have been spent in the public sector.
"
340,"Of this amount, it was planned that Rs 100 million would be financed internally (Rs 50 million from domestic revenues, Rs 10 million from internal loans and Rs 40 million, was to be financing). The remainder, Rs 500 million, was to be financed through foreign aid.
"
341,"As a result of vigorous means to limit regular budget expenditures and to increase tax receipts, budgetary savings were larger that original planned.
"
342,"Despite the pressure of increased prices and annual salary increments, regular expenditures were held to Rs 124.3 million in the first years Rs 114.3 million in the second and Rs 127.0 million in the final year.
"
343,"During this period, governmental tax and other receipts rose from Rs 129.0 million to Rs 188.5 million or almost 50 per cent.
"
344,"Total budgetary saving amounted to Rs 107.1 million over the period.
"
345,"In addition, Rs 20.6 million was secured from internal bond issues.
"
346,"Total internal financing including expenditure outlay cash balances amounted to Rs 133.40 million.
"
347,"Since the balance was provided by foreign assistance totaling Rs 470 million, the need for deficit originally planned was eliminated.
"
348,"Table 7 gives the sources of development budget expenditures in further detail.
"
349,"Table 8 gives the direct expenditure of the various aid agencies for development purposes.
"
350,"These do not go through H. M. G. development budget.
"
351,"Preferably, all development expenditure should be reflected in the annual budget.
"
352,"Steps are being taken to do this — e.g. not that in the third column to Table 8, direct expenditures by India are not shown because these are now channeled through His Majesty’s Government.
"
353,"In the past, there has been a considerable gap between actual expenditures and budgeted amounts.
"
354,"This difference has, however, been decreasing.
"
355,"In 1963-64, for example, actual expenditures were 70 per cent of the budget.
"
356,"In the following year, the proportion rose to 80 per cent.
"
357,"Over the next five years, this gap is expected to be further reduced.
"
358,"Financial Resources for the Third Plan
"
359,"As presented in Chapter III, Rs 2,500 million will be spent in the public, panchayat, and private sectors during the Third Plan period.
"
360,"Public sector expenditures are programmed are Rs 1,740 million.
"
361,"In addition, His Majesty’s Government will provide Rs 210 million to the private and panchayat sectors in the form of loans and subsidies.
"
362,"Thus, total central governmental requirements are Rs 1,950 million from internal and external sources.
"
363,"The remainder of the Rs 2,500 million must be generated by private investors and by district and village panchayats through taxation. Financing of the Public Sector
"
364,"Internal Resources In the early years of planed development in Nepal, His Majesty’s Government was unable to meet more than a small share of development expenditures and depended heavily on foreign assistance.
"
365,"In the 1951-61 2	This includes the carry over form balance of 1961-62. 3	Rs. 18 million external loans provided to NIDC is also included. periods, regular budget deficits totaled Rs 160 million.4 These were met out of accumulated governmental cash balances.
"
366,"Over the First Plan 1965-61, the regular budget ran an Rs 62.2 million deficit. Cash balances were used to meet the deficit and also to provide funds for the development budget.
"
367,"During the Second Plan, with increasing recognition that Nepal should not depend wholly on foreign assistance for development financing, emphasis was placed on generating more internal resources.
"
368,"Priority was given to those projects which promised a direct return to governmental revenues. As a result of these measures, government revenues rose rapidly.
"
369,"During the Third Plan such efforts will be continued. By 1969-70, it is estimated that governmental receipts will rise be Rs 88.5 million to Rs 340 million.
"
370,"Regular budget expenditures are expected to raise from Rs 127.0 million to216.2 million over the same period.
"
371,"Table 10 shows the expected sources of governmental revenue over Plan period.
"
372,"Sources of Internal resources
"
373,"From the additional taxes levied in 1964-65, there will be an increase of total tax receipts from Rs 188.5 million to Rs 224.2 million.
"
374,"Regular expenditures are expected to increase from Rs 127.0 million to Rs 216.2 million.
"
375,"Out of the present taxes, over the Plan period, there will be a saving of Rs 177.7 millions. During the Plan period as a result of governmental efforts, customs receipts will increase.
"
376,"Similarly revenue from excise and income taxes will rise as a result of administrative reforms in the tax machinery and rising incomes. Other tax receipts are also expected to rise.
"
377,"Keeping the present tax rates, by 1969-70 total revenue will rise to Rs 224.2 million. This will amount to four percent of gross domestic product.
"
378,"In the United States and the United Kingdom, governmental receipts amount to some 23 per cent of national income. In underdeveloped countries like Nepal, government collected 10 to 12 per cent of national income.
"
379,"Therefore, there is scope for further increase in revenue by His Majesty’s Government. By introducing new taxes and increasing existing rates an additional Rs 322.3 million will be collected over the Plan period.
"
380,"Although, 65 percent of gross domestic product comes from the agricultural sector, less than 25 per cent of government income comes from taxation of agriculture. Imposition of a greater tax load on agriculture is not, therefore, unreasonable.
"
381,"There is considerable scope for increasing taxes in the agricultural sector to finance 4Regular budget expenditures are distinguished from development budget expenditures in that the regular encompassed established government activities, whereas the development budget is concerned with the outlay for new or development projects and activities development expenditures.
"
382,"During the Plan period, therefore, taxes in this sector such as the land tax will have to be increased.
"
383,"In order to increase government income, rates of the custom duty will be studies and changed as necessary.
"
384,"Nepal’s rates of income taxes are lower than those of many underdeveloped countries.
"
385,"The maximum rate is 40 per cent of income. These rates need to be increased to raise more revenues.
"
386,"In order to reduce income differentials in Nepal, direct taxes should be levied.
"
387,"Since income levels are very low. The number of taxpayers will be quite small.
"
388,"Through these taxes alone, therefore, the development programmes cannot be fully financed.
"
389,"Indirect taxes will still continue to be an important source of income in the years ahead.
"
390,"Sales taxes will be levied during the Plan period.
"
391,"In other countries, low sales taxes are an important source of governmental receipts.
"
392,"In addition, financial conditions and financial administration in Nepal will be studies and additional indirect taxes levied.
"
393,"Internal Loans
"
394,"The system of raising internal loans for the country’s economic development started only two years ago.
"
395,"Two years, experience has been quite encouraging.
"
396,"Funds totaling Rs 13.1 million were generated in the second year of the Three Year Plan through the issue of government development bonds.
"
397,"Over the Third Plan Period, Rs 10 million will be raised annually, making a total of Rs 50 million to be spent on development projects.
"
398,"Additional taxes will be generated, domestic borrowing through sale of bonds increased, and additional foreign assistance obtained. Foreign Assistance
"
399,"Although domestic revenue available for development purposes has increased considerably, it is still inadequate to cover the entire development budget for the Third Plan.
"
400,"Therefore, foreign assistance wills con6tinie to be necessary for number of years.
"
401,"During the Third Plan, Rs 1,250 million will be needed from this source to finance planned expenditures. On the basis of current negotiations, participation by various countries and agencies will be as follows:
"
402,"India: The major projects started during the Second Plan will be completed in the Third Plan period, the estimated cost to run them being 200 million. Of the various projects started undertaken to date by India, the most significant are the Trishuli Hudel, the Chatra Canal, and the Sunauli-Pokhara road.
"
403,"The Indian Government has also agreed to undertake construction of a portion of the East-West Highway.5 Additional assistance is expected to be spent on smaller continuing projects and new activities to be taken during the Plan period.
"
404,"United States : Assistance from the United States each year is expected to remain at roughly the same level during the Third Plan as in the Second Grant assistance is expected to total Rs 310 million.
"
405,"Another, Rs 70 million will be received from general commodity assistance and in the form of machinery and equipment for the East-West Highway, giving a total of Rs 380 million for various development projects. In addition, Rs 90 million 5The total expenditures to complete these projects are es timated at Rs 480 million.
"
406,"Actual assistance received during the Plan period will be somewhat\hat smaller since some of the projects will be carried over to the Fourth Plan. will be provided for technical assistance and training facilities.
"
407,"These latter costs are not included in Plan expenditures and therefore are in addition to the Rs 1,250 million of foreign assistance expected.
"
408,"U. S. S. R.: During the Third Plan the Simra-Janakpur highway and an agricultural implement factory will be constructed with Soviet assistance.
"
409,"People’s Republic of Chins: The Kathmandu-Kodari road and the brick and tile factory will be completed during the Plan period.
"
410,"Third Plan expenditures on those two projects are estimated at Rs 60 million.
"
411,"Additional projects will also be started with Chinese assistance.6
"
412,"Other Assistance: Additional assistance will also be received from Germany, the United Kingdom, The United Nations, and Australia. Switzerland, New Zealand and the Ford Foundation.
"
413,"Economic and technical assistance for transport development is expected from the International Development Association.
"
414,"Technical Assistance
"
415,"In addition to financial assistance, technical and advisory personnel have been provided by friendly nations and international agencies.
"
416,"Their cost to the assisting nation amounts to Ts 10 million annually.
"
417,"Because of the storage of technicians and professionally trained manpower in Nepal, there will be a continuing need for foreign technical assistance during the Third Plan.
"
418,"The cost of these technicians has not been included in the Plan total. Cost data is difficult to obtain and the benefits from technicians’ services are equally difficult to measure in monetary terms.
"
419,"Nepal will continue to send its young men and women abroad for specialized training because of the limited facilities available within the country. As the cost of training varies widely from country, this also has not been included in the Plan.
"
420,"Panchayat Sector
"
421,"It is estimated that Rs 340 million will be collected under the compulsory saving component of the land reform programme over the Third Plan.
"
422,"Out of this, Rs 180 million will be used to provide credit to the tillers.
"
423,"The balance of Rs 160 million will be net saving.
"
424,"Local panachayat resources are estimated at Rs 40 million over the Plan period.
"
425,"Therefore, Rs 200 million will be made available from the panchayat sector.
"
426,"Private Sector Over the third plan Rs 520 million will be invested by the private sector of this total Rs 350 million will be secured from private savings.
"
427,"The balance will consist of loans from the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, the Cooperative Bank, and other governmentally supported financial institution.
"
428,"Monetary Policy
"
429,"The establishment of the central bank, the Nepal Rastra Bank, in 1965, filled a major gap in the monetary system.
"
430,"During that period, Indian currency circulated freely throughout the country. The exchange rate between Indian and Nepalese currencies, however, fluctuated considerably.
"
431,"Beginning in 1960, however, the Nepal Rastra Bank stabilized the exchange rate, fixing it at Rs 100 IC, and was put to an end the years, unstable exchange rate of Indian and Nepalese currency.
"
432,"Various measures were taken during the Second Plan period to convert to a single currency system.
"
433,"As a consequence, the use of Nepali currency is expanding, while the circulation of Indian currency is declining.
"
434,"Since some of the larger projects will not be completed during the Plan period, actual expenditures will be somewhat smaller.
"
435,"The quantity of Nepalese currency in circulation increased rapidly during the Second Plan period.
"
436,"In
"
437,"July, 1962, the money supply amounted tom Rs 227.8 million.
"
438,"By July 1965, it had increased to an estimated Rs 400 million.
"
439,"Over the three year period, the money supply rose by 95 percent, a rapid rate of increase.
"
440,"One of the reasons for the expansion of the expansion of the money supply is the replacement of Indian currency.
"
441,"The Governments will then limit the expansion of Indian currency balances.
"
442,"With the establishment of her own currency system, Nepal is now in a position to influence the price t hrough monetary policies. Foreign Exchange
"
443,"Since November, 1960, all convertible currency transactions have been handled through the Nepal Rastra Bank.
"
444,"In July, 1960 the Bank held Rs 55.75 million of convertible currencies and gold.
"
445,"By January, 1965, convertible reserves had risen to Rs 192.71 million, an increase of 248 per cent.
"
446,"Similarly, inconvertible foreign exchange during this period rose from Rs 82.1 million to Rs 204.7 million.
"
447,"The Second Plan estimated currency requirements to be provided by Nepal for plan expenditures at Rs 65 million.
"
448,"Actually HMG spent Rs 50 million from its own resources.
"
449,"Total foreign currency receipts over the Second Plan period cannot be estimated because of the absence of data.
"
450,"The cost of construction materials, equipment and other imports to be financed by aid-giving countries has not been included in Table 12.
"
451,"The commercial bank and other institutions have provided short term loans at relatively low interest rates for commerce, trades and industry. Long term loans are also needed for industrial and agricultural development.
"
452,"Financial institutions to meet these requirements are essential for economic growth. His Majesty’s Government has taken various steps to collect available savings including the establishment of specialized financial institutions.
"
453,"During the next five years, the existing institutions will be strengthened and new units established as required.
"
454,"Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC)
"
455,"NIDC was established as a government corporation in 1954 to provide financial and technical assistance to the private sector.
"
456,"During 1960-61 loans and equity participation of Rs 411 thousand were made available to private companies.
"
457,"Over the Second Plan period, another more than Rs 30 million was made available.
"
458,"During the Third Plan, the activities of the Corporation will be expanded still further.
"
459,"Cooperative Bank
"
460,"The Cooperative Bank was established during the Second Plan to provide loans funds to cooperative societies and individual farmers for agricultural development. His Majesty’s Government has provided Ts 2.7 million in share capital and loans to the bank.
"
461,"During the Second Plan, the bank made loans totaling approximately Rs 1.6 million.
"
462,"The organization of the bank will be strengthened and it is operations greatly expanded.
"
463,"National Commercial Bank
"
464,"The Nepal Bank, established in 1938, is at present the only commercial bank in Nepal.
"
465,"As this bank alone cannot meet the financial requirements of commerce, trade and industry, a new bank, the Nepal Commercial Bank has been established in the public sector. This institution will begin operations during the Third Plan.
"
466,"It will develop banking facilities in areas which are presently not served by a commercial bank and operate as an agent of the Nepal Rastra Bank.
"
467,"This will relieve the Rastra Bank of some of its present functions and enable it to concentrate its efforts upon improving the monetary system of the country.
"
468,"Agricultural Bank
"
469,"At present, there is not institution beside the Cooperative Bank to provide medium and long term loans to cultivators for agricultural development.
"
470,"Since the existing bank cannot effectively provide loan facilities both the cooperative societies and individual farmers, a separate bank will be established during the Third Plan.
"
471,"Insurance Companies
"
472,"Insurance enterprises have been as important source of savings in developed and developing countries.
"
473,"Nepal as yet has not been able to establish its own insurance companies.
"
474,"These functions are presently handled by foreign firms.
"
475,"Premium collections are estimated at Rs 8 million annually.
"
476,"In order to keep these funds within the country, insurance activities will be initiated during the coming plan period. Stock Exchange
"
477,"Stock exchanges play an important role in the development of financial institutions and the channeling of savings into investment opportunities.
"
478,"Plans are therefore being made to establish a stock exchange in Nepal. CHAPTER VI
"
479,"Population and Manpower
"
480,"Manpower is the most important resource of any nation.
"
481,"The future of a country which has a literate, healthy and hard working population is bright regardless of the availability of other resources.
"
482,"One measure of development is the level of production.
"
483,"This is affected not only by the numbers but also the quality of the labour force.
"
484,"Labour quality is dependent upon literacy, physical and intellectual development, and technical knowledge and the adaptability of the workers to new environments.
"
485,"Population growth also vitally affects economic development.
"
486,"A rapid rate of growth tends to hold back development.
"
487,"It is, therefore, necessary to analyze the existing population and its anticipated growth as a part of the planning process. Population
"
488,"The first national population census was taken in 1911-12.
"
489,"It counted 5,638.749 persons in Nepal. Population censes have been taken every ten years since then.
"
490,"The first census bases on international standards were conducted in 1952-54.
"
491,"The difficult nature of the terrain, the poor transport facilities and the shortage of trained manpower made it necessary to spread the field activities over tow years, thus casting some doubt upon the reliability of the figures.
"
492,"The latest census, 1961-62, was completed within a shorter period and more modern techniques were applied. The results are, therefore, presumed to be more accurate.
"
493,"From 1910-11 to 1961-62, population increased by 3,841,650 or 68.12 per cent. This is an average annual increase of 1.4 per cent.
"
494,"As a result of health services expansion, life expectancy is rising and the rate of population increase has undoubtedly also risen. Between the censuses of 1954 and 1961, the rate of increase averaged 1.6 per cent annually.
"
495,"The rate has undoubtedly risen further and is probably about 2.0 per cent at present. A sample survey of births and deaths in 1964 tends to confirm the 2.0 per cent rate.
"
496,"An analytical study of the latest census data indicates that the infant mortality rate is 244 per 1,000 births; the birth rate 41.1; and the death rate, 20.8.
"
497,"This emphasized the necessity of undertaken an effective and widespread family planning programme.
"
498,"At present there is an average of 175 persons per square mile.
"
499,"Because of the topography, cultivable lands in limited and density per cultivable area is mush higher. As shown in Table 14, population density in the Terai per unit of cultivated area is less than in the hills.
"
500,"This indicated the desirability of shifting some of the hill population to the Terai.
"
501,"Unless the transfer is made, per capita production in the hill areas is likely to decline with further population increase. Labour Force
"
502,"The labour force in Nepal is defined as the group above the age of 15: at present the total is estimated to be 4,307,222 as shown in Table 15.
"
503,"Table 15 shows labour force data. per cent in industry, 1.5 per cent in service, less than 1.0 per cent in commerce and 1.7 per cent in other occupations.
"
504,"A large proportion of the labour force in non-agricultural activities is found in Kathmandu.
"
505,"In the Terai and in the hills, the agricultural proportion is correspondingly high.
"
506,"A comparative study of the censuses of 1952-54 and 1961-62, shows that 50 per cent of the population was counted as in the labour force in the earlier period with equal male and female participation.
"
507,"By 1961-62 only 43.8 per cent was included.
"
508,"The reason for the decrease is due to the expansion of educational facilities.
"
509,"The proportion of the population considered literate in 1952-54 was 4.4 per cent.
"
510,"Of this group, 60 per cent had attended or were attending Primary School, 26 per cent Secondary School and 13 per cent College.
"
511,"By 1961-62, 8.9 per cent of the populations were in the literate category.
"
512,"Of these, the Primary School portion had risen to 72 per cent, the Secondary School portion to 18 per cent, 7 per cent in the intermediate degree category and 3 per cent in the higher levels of college training.
"
513,"Assuming that the labour force increases at the same rate as the population, and in the same proportion for agriculture and other sectors the pressure on agricultural occupations will increase.
"
514,"Therefore, employment opportunities outside of agriculture muse expand, not only to stimulate economic growth but also to maintain existing income levels. One of the primary objectives of the Third Plan, therefore, is to transfer labour from agriculture to other sectors.
"
515,"Technical Manpower
"
516,"1. The time required to train technicians and professional people.
"
517,"Students have also been sent to Pakistan, Germany, Israel, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Ceylon and Japan.
"
518,"Within Nepal, an additional 470 were trained in agriculture, 181 in forestry, 130 in engineering, 245 in health, 1,087 in primary education, 1,386 in cottage industries, 1,745 in panchayats and 205 in the cooperative sector.
"
519,"(Detailed data are given in the respective appe nds tables).
"
520,"Trained-Manpower Requirements
"
521,"Table 16 gives an estimate of the additional trained manpower required during the Third Plan, estimated availability and the anticipated gap.
"
522,"Expansion of Training Facilities
"
523,"In order to meet the expanding requirements for trained manpower, existing training facilities will be expanded and new units started.
"
524,"As noted above, an engineering college, a medical school, and an agricultural college will be established.
"
525,"Even with these new facilities available, trained manpower will be inadequate to meet demands.
"
526,"Trained personnel from outside will, therefore, continue to be utilized.
"
527,"There are fourteen training centers for middle -grade technicians.
"
528,"In addition, more limited training programmes are conducted by several government departments.
"
529,"It is evident that additional facilities are required.
"
530,"There has been a rapid expansion in the demand for engineers, particularly mechanical engineers.
"
531,"There is a pressing need for technicians and skilled labour in the construction sector.
"
532,"The one unit in this area has very limited capacity; because it must be expanded and additional facilities established.
"
533,"A polytechnic institute will help meet these requirements by providing training in a variety of area.
"
534,"The present engineering school will therefore be expanded into a polytechnic institute.
"
535,"Other facilities will be established for low level technicians.
"
536,"Efforts will be made to utilize more effectively the services of the retired soldiers who have received technical training abroad.
"
537,"It is estimated that some 300 soldiers with such training retire annually.
"
538,"The largest skill- group consists of machines.
"
539,"Technical Assi stance
"
540,"The technical assistance which Nepal receives from aid -giving agencies is very important because of the limited number of persons with the essential training and experience available in Nepal.
"
541,"Such assistance, moreover, will stimulate the development of local skills and talents.
"
542,"Every effort will be made Nepali Personnel. PART II
"
543,"DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES CHAPTER VII
"
544,"Agricultural Development
"
545,"The world average yields of paddy, maize and wheat are 2,030, 2,080 and 1179 kilograms per hectare; whereas the yields in Nepal are only 1,819, 1,898 and 1,112 kilograms per hectare.
"
546,"In Japan the average yield per hectare of these food grains is 4,700, 2,700 and2.740 kilograms.
"
547,"It is evident that a substantial increase in agricultural output can be achieved through improved techniques.
"
548,"The expenditures required for improving techniques will be less than those required in other areas.
"
549,"Since output can be increased at relatively low cost it is imperative, to meet the target of doubling national income within fifteen years, that major stress be given the development agriculture. Present Condition
"
550,"In the First and Second Plan periods, special attention was given the establishment of experimental farms and livestock centres and the training of middle-grade technicians. At present there are eleven agronomy farms, four crop protection centres, an agricultural implement research and production unit, 16 horticulture centres, four livestock breeding units, two sheep breeding centres, three pig farms two poultry farms, one hatchery, one research station, 33 veterinary hospitals and dispensaries, three cheese centres, one central dairy, seven fishery units, a resettlement centre and a tractor station.
"
551,"Problems of Agricultural Development
"
552,"Agricultural output must be increased to meet the food requirements of the growing population, to priority raw materials for expanding industries and to earn foreign exchange through larger exports.
"
553,"Paddy is the main crop of Nepal and is cultivated on some 1,100,000 hectares.
"
554,"Since there is little possibility of expanding paddy cultivation into new areas, the target of an increase of 7.5 per cent will be achieved by using improved techniques on 350,000 hectares.
"
555,"On 200,000 hectares of this total, 22 per cent of the increase in production will stem from increased use of chemical fertilizer and 78 per cent from the use of natural fertilizer, improved seed and irrigation water.
"
556,"Improved seeds will be used on 73 thousand hectares, especially in the hill regions. Thirty per cent of the total fertilizer use target will be for paddy.
"
557,"Maize
"
558,"In the hill regions of Nepal, maize is the main food item of the people.
"
559,"Cultivation can be expanded by another 245,000 hectares. Out of 245, hectares, 28.5 thousand will be brought under maize during the Plan period.
"
560,"Manure and other fertilizers will be used on 50 thousand hectares, and hybrid seed will be sown on 28.5 thousand hectares.
"
561,"This program will be emphasized in the Hills and in parts of the Inner Terai. Wheat
"
562,"Winter crop production in Nepal is very limited largely because of the limited availability of water.
"
563,"Wheat is cultivated in some 125.000 hectares; although the total cultivable area on which wheat could be grows is 1.4 million hectares.
"
564,"During the Plan period wheat will be grown on 200,000 hectares and an additional 270,000 metric tons will be produced.
"
565,"Emphasis will be given the use of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers.
"
566,"A ‘Grow More Wheat’ campaign will be carried out throughout Nepal.
"
567,"Programme for Cash Crops Sugarcane
"
568,"To meet the sugarcane requirements of the existing sugar factories and of those to be opened in the future, sugarcane output will be doubled. At presents cane is cultivated on only 9 thousand hectares.
"
569,"Sugarcane can be cultivated on some 32 thousand hectares in Nepal. During the Third Plan period cane will be grown on an additional 5.7 thousand hectares in the districts of Bara, Parsa, Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Banke, Morang and Sarlahi.
"
570,"Improved seeds will be used in the new areas as well as on the presently cultivated lands of Morang, Rupandehi, Kapilvastu, Bara and Parsa districts.
"
571,"Emphasis will be placed upon the proper use of fertilizers.
"
572,"Jute
"
573,"Jute is one of our main export crops; in trade beyond India, it is most important.
"
574,"Present, jute is cultivated in Saptari, Morang, and Jhapa districts on 32 thousand hectares. During the coming five years, an additional ten thousand hectares will be sown with jute and annual output by 1969-70 will be 54 thousand metric tons.
"
575,"To increase output improved techniques, improved seeds and chemical fertilizers will be used.
"
576,"Improved techniques and improved seeds will be used in cultivation, particularly those seeds recommended by the cigarette factory such as Virginia Gold, Del Crest and Australist.
"
577,"Oil-seeds, particularly mustard, are cultivated on 108,000 hectares. Annual production is estimated to be about 51,500 metric tons.
"
578,"To achieve the 18 per cent increase targeted for the Plan period, improved seeds and fertilizers will be applied to 50,000 hectares. Mustard will be planted on additional 7.5 thousand hectares in the districts of Chitawan, Nawalparasi, Dang Deokhuri, Bardia, Kanchanpur and Banke. Thus, an additional nine thousand metric tons of oil-seed will be produced annually.
"
579,"Provision of Necessary Factors of Production The above targets will be achieved by making advances in the following areas: (1) irrigation and soil conservation, (2) use of improved seeds, (3) fertilizer use, (4) crop protection and (5) use of improved techniques.
"
580,"These will be responsible for output increases of 3.5 per cent, five per cent, one per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively
"
581,"Cultivators can put forth their joint efforts to secure additional water. Since the policy is that 50 per cent of the cost minor irrigation is borne by the cultivators who use the facilities, more attention is given to proper use and maintenance.
"
582,"In addition, in the Terai and the hills, irrigation will be undertaken with tube- well and other arrangements. Soil Conservation
"
583,"Higher yielding seeds are important in increasing agricultural production.
"
584,"Improved seeds result in larger output and in crops which can be stored for longer periods.
"
585,"During the Plan, 55.5 thousand metric tons of food grain seeds and 96.6 thousand metric tons of cash crops seeds will be required. A five per cent increase in food grain production will be achieved by the use of improved seeds on 800,000 hectares.
"
586,"The eleven agronomy farms established during the Second Plan will produce 248 metric tons of seed.
"
587,"In the Third Plan, for additional agronomy farms will be established. Research and experimentation on seed varieties will be undertaken on the new farms.
"
588,"After experimental work is completed, the nucleus seed will be grown on government farms and distributed among the registered seed producer.
"
589,"The seed producers in turn will grow the improved seeds under the guidance of the technical advisors to be provided by the government.
"
590,"A system of seed growing will be established. To encourage seed cultivators, seeds will be purchased from through the extension service.
"
591,"Chemical Fertilizers
"
592,"To increase production, the fertility of the soil must be maintained and improved.
"
593,"To achieve this, the plan calls for the use of 108,076 tons of ammonium sulphate, 25,672 metric tons of potassium and 87,467 metric tons of phosphate. By 1969-70, a total 86,262 metric tons of chemical fertilizers will be required annually.
"
594,"At present the application of chemical fertilizers is very limited.
"
595,"As chemical fertilizer use is relatively unknown to the cultivators, a considerable time period will be needed before chemical fertilizer will be extensively used.
"
596,"Cultivators will be encouraged to use them and to grow more than one crop.
"
597,"Because of transport difficulties emphasis will be placed on the regions where such facilities already exist. Marketing and distribution channels must be established.
"
598,"Moreover, fertilizer requirement during the Plan is very large compared with present use.
"
599,"Therefore, agreements should be made well in advance with fertilizer exporting countries.
"
600,"In addition to chemical fertilizer, compost, which can be produced within the country, and green manure are also important in increasing production.
"
601,"As the latter types of fertilizers are known to the cultivators, it should not be difficult to expand their use.
"
602,"Encouragement will be given with the production and use of green manure.
"
603,"Plant Protection
"
604,"An estimated 15 per cent of the total crop production is destroyed by plant diseases and insects.
"
605,"Thus, a corresponding increase in the Plan period could be achieved if the crop were fully protected from damage and destruction.
"
606,"However, it is not possible to carry out such a program for the entire country within a few years.
"
607,"During the Plan period, plant protection will be carried out on 150,000 hectares covering paddy, maize, sugarcane, jute, tobacco and potatoes.
"
608,"Insects such as borers, afid, and others will be controlled by the use of metatoes, folidol, and aldrin chemicals.
"
609,"A plant quarantine program will be carried out to prevent the spread of plant diseases.
"
610,"Agricultural Implements Although some cultivators realize the importance of agricultural implement in increasing output, improved implements are not produced in Nepal but are imported from India.
"
611,"However, they are not suitable to the soil and climate of the country.
"
612,"An Agriculture Supply Corporation will be established at the ginning of the Plan period to make available improved seeds, fertilizers, insecticides, and agricultural implements.
"
613,"This Corporation will distribute improved seeds. It will also produce, collect and procure improved seeds, test for purity, protect from insects, and grade the seeds.
"
614,"In addition, the Corporation will make available chemical fertilizers, pesticides, agriculture implement, etc. For this, the Corporation will have keep in close contact with the National Trading Company and, extension services, with the Agricultural Department and Cooperative Banks.
"
615,"Its activities should also be coordinated with the agricultural extension and land reform programmes.
"
616,"Horticulture Development
"
617,"Nepal has tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate climates which are suitable for horticulture development.
"
618,"The lower regions of the Himalayan belt and the central regions of the country are better suited for the growing of fruits and vegetables than other agricultural products.
"
619,"In Ilam, where potatoes are the main crop, a potato development centre will be established which will produce disease-free stock.
"
620,"During the Plan period, the production of potatoes will be increased by 20 per cent. In addition to the production of fruits and vegetables, attention must be given to their preservation.
"
621,"A preservation centre was established at the Kirtipur Horticulture Centre during the Second Plan. Fruit from Dharan, Dhankuta, Pokhara, etc. is brought to this centre where it is tested, canned and sold.
"
622,"In the Plan period, this centre will be expanded and a similar centre will also be established in Dharan.
"
623,"Tea plantations in Nepal, especially in the eastern region of the country, appear to be profitable. A Tea Development Broad will be established during the Plan period.
"
624,"This Broad wills mange the tea gardens in Ilam and Soktim. The Broad will replant old tea gardens and establish nurseries to provided seeds.
"
625,"It will also encourage private investment in tea plantations.
"
626,"Livestock, Poultry and Fish Improvement
"
627,"Since three-fourths on Nepal’s is covered by hills and mountains, there is great potential fo r livestock development. Pastures in the hills can be extensively developed, although relatively few areas are being used at present.
"
628,"Moreover, the northern part of the country is at a higher elevation and thus isles suited for food grain development. Therefore, livestock improvement will be emphasized in these regions.
"
629,"As yet, no substantial progress has been made in this field.
"
630,"However, in view of the importance of cattle to the economy, greater stress will be given to this sector in the Third Plan.
"
631,"Brown Swiss, Jersey, Sinthi, and other breeds will be used to improve local cows and increase milk production.
"
632,"Stronger bullocks will be established. A horse farm will be established in Phidim, Mechi Zone, to improve breeds.
"
633,"Sheep
"
634,"Sheep herbing is one of the oldest occupations in the country. In the Himalayan belt, there are many families who raise sheep for their livelihood.
"
635,"But, as a result of lack of knowledge of modern techniques and the poor condition of pastures, sheep production has been declining in recent years. Sheep are being imported to meet the meat and wool requirements of the expanding population.
"
636,"A sheep farm was established in Pokhara during the Second Plan in order to improve the local stock by proper feeding, care, and breeding.
"
637,"Poultry rising has proved to be a successful and profitable business.
"
638,"In the beginning of the Second Plan, there were only ten poultry farms.
"
639,"By the final year of the Plan, this number had increased of 480.
"
640,"The hatchery at Parwanipur with a capacity of 60,000 could produce only one-third of the requirements of the poultry farms.
"
641,"The transportation of day-old chickens to all areas of Nepal is difficult.
"
642,"To overcome this problem and to meet expanding demand, four hatcheries, one each in Kathmandu, Birtanagar, Bhairahawa, and Nepalgunj, will be opened during the Plan period.
"
643,"The Parwanipur hatchery will be expended to a capacity of 80,000 chicks a year.
"
644,"These hatcheries will produce a total of 1,100,000 chicks during the Plan period.
"
645,"By 1969-70, the annual capacity will be 300,000.
"
646,"Fishery Development
"
647,"Fishing in Nepal is still unrestricted. Fish are taken from the streams with the use of dynamite.
"
648,"This should be stopped.
"
649,"In the Second Plan, fast growing carp were imported. Israel carp breeding centres are established at Godavari, Janakpur, Pokhara Parwanipur, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar.
"
650,"It is estimated that fish production during 1962-65 in both the private and public sectors was 100 metric tons.
"
651,"During this Plan period two additional fish breeding farms will be opened. The increasing demand for fish as a result of increased incomes has made it essential that fish farming be undertaken on a large scale.
"
652,"A commercial fish farm of 25-40 hectares will be opened at Hetaura to produce fish for sale to customers. By the end of the Plan annual fish production from these farms will be 285 me tric tons.
"
653,"Veterinary Services The provision of veterinary services is one of the major requirements for agricultural development.
"
654,"The present Plan aims at making more veterinary facilities available and at opening 12 dispensaries in the less accessible regions of the country.
"
655,"Four check posts will be opened at Butwal, Dharan, Hetaura and Darchula. By the final year of the Plan, the newly established research center will be producing a broad array of animal vaccines.
"
656,"Dairy Farming
"
657,"Dairy development has not been given necessary attention.
"
658,"However, there has been progress in cheese production.
"
659,"The Cheese factories at East No. 2, East No. 3, and West No.1 have made considerable progress. Production for the past three years is estimated at some 26,000 kilograms of cheese.
"
660,"A cheese processing plant has been installed in Kathnamdu.
"
661,"Nepali cheese has grained a good reputation in foreign markets.
"
662,"During the Third Plan, eight new cheese factories will be established. These will produce 30,000 kilograms of cheese annually and increase the incomes of 500 yak raising families in the northern part on Nepal.
"
663,"It is estimated that annual cheese production will be 46,000 kilograms by 1970. At present, a dairy center is located in Kathmandu.
"
664,"This center collects processes and distributes 500,000 liters of milk.
"
665,"Efforts will be made during the Plan to increase milk production in Kathnmandu Valley and milk will also be collected from outside the Valley.
"
666,"Once this is done the Kathmandu Central Dairy will have a processing capacity of 10,000 liters per day. Carcass Utilization
"
667,"Presently there are inadequate facilities to utilize animal carcasses. Facilities are needed to get maximum benefits.
"
668,"Such plants are needed to make use of carcass components which would otherwise be wasted. These animals feed supplements.
"
669,"Therefore, carcass utilization plants will be established in selected areas during the Plan period.
"
670,"Artificial Insemination
"
671,"The number of cattle in Nepal is estimated at 7,300,000.
"
672,"Breeding must be improved; the livestock improvement programme is designed to improve local breeds.
"
673,"To achieve this, an artificial insemination programme was started five years ago.
"
674,"According to the report on this programme, 70 per cent of the artificial inseminations have been successful.
"
675,"However, there has been relatively little effect upon cattle quality. In the present Plan period, this programme will be gradually expanded.
"
676,"In areas where the concentrated in villages and districts where livestock farms and/or veterinary branches exist.
"
677,"Ninety thousand cows and buffaloes will be artificially inseminated during the Plan period.
"
678,"Programme Relating to Agriculture
"
679,"In addition to the items mentioned above, the agriculture development programme includes other activities.
"
680,"Their purpose is to support and evaluate agriculture development programmes.
"
681,"Some of the main programmes are described below.
"
682,"Agriculture Research Research activities will be undertaken in the various sections of the Agriculture Department.
"
683,"Work will be done to determine suitability in Nepal of agricultural techniques that have been successful in other countries.
"
684,"Efforts will be made to provide the cultivators with help in increasing agricultural production, i.e. by improved seeds, plants, livestock, implements, fertilizers, and similar factors.
"
685,"Some of those w ill be produced on the farms and units of the department and sold to the cultivators. Items which cannot be produced within the country, such as chemical fertilizers, seeds, and insecticides, will be imported.
"
686,"Training
"
687,"Middle grade technicians are being trained at the Agriculture School. They are trained to assist the cultivators in making the best use of available resources.
"
688,"A t present, the trainers are given diplomas in agriculture and home sciences.
"
689,"There are also short-term training facilities for field men, field assistants, etc. During the Second Plan 680 were trained.
"
690,"Most of the high level technicians required in Nepal— doctors, engineers, and agriculture specialists— receive their training in India.
"
691,"Some 10-15 agriculture technicians are returning from India every year.
"
692,"With the expansion of agricultural activities, high level manpower requirements will also increase.
"
693,"To meet the targets set forth in the Plan, 250 advanced (graduate) and 1,400 middle grades (JTA) technicians will be required.
"
694,"In view of the increased demand, 50 persons will be sent to India and abroad for technical training during the Plan period the middle grade technicians will be trained locally.
"
695,"An agriculture College will be established during the Plan period.
"
696,"Agricultural Extension
"
697,"Agricultural production will not increase unless improved techniques are adopted by the cultivators.
"
698,"This will not be possible unless a link is established between the experimental stations and the cultivators. Contact between these two groups is maintained through agricultural extension.
"
699,"Under this programme, middle grade technicians go into the field and demonstrate various improved techniques to the cultivators.
"
700,"When problems arise, those technicians ask the relevant technical section for advice. At present there are 120 agronomy JTAs; nine Home Science JTAs and 29 other JTAs who are responsible for extension activities in the various districts.
"
701,"These technicians work under the guidance of the district panchayats.
"
702,"To provide technical assistance to these JTA, one agricultural extension officer is stationed in each zone.
"
703,"Unless the various factors of production such as improved seeds, fertilizer, insecticides are available, times and places at a reasonable price, supply centres will be established in various areas.
"
704,"Extension services will cover 900,000 hectares during the Plan period. Agriculture extension to date has not been very successful because of the lack of transport facilities, technicians, and coordination with other developmental programmes, improved seeds, fertilizer, credit and efficient administration.
"
705,"Necessary steps will be taken to overcome these difficulties. The extension program will also undertake a campaign to stimulate the production of wheat and vegetables.
"
706,"Extensive publicity on agricultural problems and their solutions is necessary.
"
707,"Therefore, a publicity programme has been included in the Plan. This will be managed by a separate section.
"
708,"Agricultural Economics and Statistics
"
709,"The purpose of this programme is to collect agricultural and related data and to study the potential of agricultural industries.
"
710,"This programme will also study and analyze land use, crop production, livestock use, weather conditions, prices of agricultural products, marketing systems, the village economy, cultivation techniques etc. Grading of agricultural products and quality control will also be started.
"
711,"Although, agriculture in a vital part of the economy, there is inadequate data on agriculture at present.
"
712,"To undertake effective programmes, much more data is needed.
"
713,"Efforts will be made together as much data as possible.
"
714,"Resettlement Programme
"
715,"Since the non -agricultural sectors of the economy are still undeveloped, increases in population must be at least partially absorbed in agriculture.
"
716,"Population pressure on land is severe in the hill regions.
"
717,"It is less serious in the Terai since there are still cultivable lands available.
"
718,"People have been moving out of the Terai.
"
719,"They clear the jungles and settle wherever they can.
"
720,"Often these people move from one place to another, clearing a different area of the jungle leach time.
"
721,"This kind of unorganized clearing and cultivation reduces the forest resources of the country.
"
722,"Progress made up to the present time
"
723,"The first organized resettlement programme was started by His Majesty’s Government in the Rapti Valley during the First Plan.
"
724,"Under this programme, 10,000 hectares of land were distributed for the settlement of 5,000 families.
"
725,"Other facilities such as schools, hospitals and market areas were also made available.
"
726,"During the Second Plan, additional families were resettled. In the Nawalpur project in Lumbini zone 700 families were resettled on 1,850 hectares.
"
727,"Programme under the Third Plan
"
728,"During the Third Plan, population is expected to increase at the r ate of 150 thousand annually. Of this, ninety-five thousand will occur in the hill regions.
"
729,"This Act could not be effectively implemented because of the absence of adequate records of land ownership; no sources of the credit other than the landlords and merchants; an d, above all, the absence of efficient land administration.
"
730,"According to the Birts Abolition Act, all the lands which were entirely or partially exempted from and revenue were removed from that status.
"
731,"The ownership of these lands was assumed by His Majesty’s Government. Under the Estates Abolition Act all estates were dissolved.
"
732,"Despite these measures the condition of the cultivator did not improve.
"
733,"Lack of tenancy records, the limited number of cooperative societies, and the slow progress of the cadastral survey were some of the barriers.
"
734,"The specific objectives of the present Land Reform programme are: to prepare full records of tenancy, to provide alternative sources of credit to expedite the progress of the cadastral survey work and to establish an efficient and modern system of land administration. Although, a majority of the people in Nepal own some land, much is owned by relatively few people.
"
735,"This fact has direct bearing upon agricultural production, particularly in the Terai region. Moreover, the presence of middlemen in the land system affects the income on the peasant.
"
736,"The final impact of the evils of the existing land system is upon the peasant.
"
737,"Though the function of the Zamindari system was to help the government collect land revenue, it because a means of exploitation.
"
738,"Therefore, the abolition of the Zamindari system is essential to Nepal’s development. The Land Reform Act of 1964
"
739,"A new land reform measure was enacted in 1964, which is of major importance from the economic and social points of view.
"
740,"Rights of both landlords and tenants have been secured by this Act.
"
741,"The salient features of the Act are:
"
742,"7. A compulsory saving program to provide an alternative source of credit, and the interception of loan repayments to private lenders.
"
743,"Progress to Date A considerable period of time is necessary to implement the above listed provisions on a national scale.
"
744,"The Land Reform Programme had been implemented in 16 development districts1by the end of t he Second Plan.
"
745,"The programme will cover the rest of Nepal in the first few years of the Third Plan.
"
746,"In nine of the 16 districts in which work was undertaken during the Second Plan, cadastral survey work was carried on together with the identification of tenants and the distribution of provisional certificates of tenancy. These provisional certificates will be replaced by the issuance of permanent certificates at a later date.
"
747,"Other phases of the programme — fixing rent, collecting data on production, preparing tenancy records, recording debts, collecting compulsory savings deposits, intercepting debt repayments and acquiring land in excess of the legal ceiling or holdings— are also underway.
"
748,"To date, the cadastral survey has covered 57,333 hectares of land is 250 Village Panchayats.
"
749,"Records for 182,000 tenants have been issued to 64,500 tenants. In seven districts, activities such as the preparation of debt records, tenancy holdings, compulsory savings collection, and the organization of ward commit tees for the interception of loan repayments are in full swing.
"
750,"Savings in kind have amounted to 31,481.17 metric tons and in cash to Rs. 850,000. Records have been complied for more than 300,000 contributors.
"
751,"The loans advanced by these committees to the peasants have amounted to Rs 85,000 and 851.22 metric tons in cash and in kind respectively. Difficulties Faced by the Programme
"
752,"The preparation of land records and the identification of tenants are progressing satisfactorily. This achievement can be ascribed to the existence of special courts.
"
753,"However, the forced eviction of tenants from land in some of the districts has become a major problem.
"
754,"Delay in cadastral survey work is another obstacle to the progress of the Land Reform programme. The cadastral survey work, which will be discussed later, should be separated from the Land Reform Programme.
"
755,"The realization of debt repayments from the cultivators is not satisfactory. It may be attributable to the fact that this work was started after the harvest season.
"
756,"The Land Reform Programme under the Third Plan The Land Reform Programme will be completed in the early years of the Plan.
"
757,"Tenancy rights will be secured and an alternative system of credit will be established. The cadastral survey work, redistribution of excess holding, establishment of land of land administration, permanent credit facilities and agriculture development world will be continued through the Plan period.
"
758,"Since one goal of the programme is no improve the economic condition of the cultivator by giving him land ownership, efforts will be made to realize this goal in the Third Plan period.
"
759,"Cadastral survey work on all cultivated land and the creation of an efficient and modern land administration system is of special importance. Cadastral Survey
"
760,"Land revenue assessment in Nepal is based upon many factors. The quality of seed used on the land, the area of land that can be ploughed by a pair of oxen in a day, the area of land that can be dug by spades in a day, and chain measurement are some of the bases for assessment.
"
761,"The present records are not accurate since 1The 16 development districts are Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kabhre Palanchowk, Sindhu Palanchowk, Nuwakot, Dhading, Rasuwa, Bara, Parsa, Rautahat, Bardia, Kailali, Jhapa, Chitawan and Makawanpur. they do not correspond to data secured by actual measurement.
"
762,"The need for an accurate cadastral survey is apparent.
"
763,"The need for such a unit is also clear form the fact that the administration of land should be coordinated with the land reform programme.
"
764,"The activities of this department will be initially limited to those districts where the land reform programme is underway.
"
765,"Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Development
"
766,"Credit facilities have an important role ion the development of agriculture.
"
767,"The Present agricultural system cannot be improved without credit.
"
768,"There are various reasons fo r the slow progress of cooperative development to date.
"
769,"Because of these small scales, societies find it difficult to work commercially.
"
770,"Again, if the societies are limited only to credit, they cannot provide full benefit to the cultivators.
"
771,"Therefore, expanded field work and the establishment of production and marketing societies are necessary.
"
772,"Three hundred fifty large multipurpose cooperatives will be established during the Third Plan. These will not be limited to credit but will also be marketing and supply units as well and encourage cottage industry development and undertake management of god owns.
"
773,"These institutions will be organized in those districts where land reform work is underway. One cooperative institution will be organized for each village Panachayat.
"
774,"Efforts will be made to develop experimental cooperative in the agricultural sector.
"
775,"For this purpose, ten agricultural cooperatives with a total of at least 1,000 families will be organized.
"
776,"In addition, ten consumer institutions in urban areas 75 industrial cooperatives will be established. Emphasis will be given to paper, metal working, carpets, textiles, ceramics, nickel-plating, soap, curios, carpentry, furniture, and fruit canning activities for the industrial units.
"
777,"In total, 545 new cooperatives will be organized.
"
778,"A total of 30 cooperative federations will be established at the district level to provide management assistance and to coordinate the activities of the primary institutions.
"
779,"A national Federation will be organized with the district units as members. Coordination with the Land Reform Programme
"
780,"A multipurpose cooperative will be established in each village panchayat where full implementation of the Land Reform has taken place. Resources to assist these multipurpose institutions will be provided.
"
781,"Only a limited number of cooperatives will be established over the next five years because of administrative limitations.
"
782,"These institutions will be supervised by a committee with representatives from each ward. The cooperatives will assess the members, prepare agricultural development plans, collect savings, supply consumer goods and manage god owns.
"
783,"As the primary institutions are the cooperative movement, efforts will be made to solve the problems faced by these units and to meet their financial needs.
"
784,"Government activity in this field will be conducted through these institutions.
"
785,"Cooperative Organization
"
786,"A nationwide cooperative federation will be organized.
"
787,"It will prepare and implement a coordinate programme of cooperative activities.
"
788,"District cooperative federation will be established and will be members of the national federation.
"
789,"Village panchayat cooperatives will, in turn, be members of the district federations.
"
790,"The district units will provide funds for credit purposes and assist in marketing agricultural products.
"
791,"Training
"
792,"Trained personnel are needed for efficient operation of the cooperatives.
"
793,"In the absence of such personnel, cooperative development will suffer.
"
794,"Development staff and higher society officials will be trained. Short term training will be given to cooperative auditors and sub-inspectors. The managers of the village panchayat cooperatives, supply and marketing supervisors, ward supervisors and supply officers will also be trained.
"
795,"Banking Facilities
"
796,"The present Cooperative Bank will supply loans to the farmers through the cooperative institutions.
"
797,"This bank was established in 1963. It has a major role in providing necessary credit for the development of cooperatives and the successful implementation of the Land Reform programme.
"
798,"It presently has more than Rs 2.9 million of paid up capital. The bank has played an important role on Jhapa District.
"
799,"Eleven godowns at Jhapa, Nepaljung and Biratnagar have been constructed with the assistance of the bank. The godowns have a total capacity of 8,000 mounds.
"
800,"Loans totaling Rs 100,000 were made available for the resettlement program at Nawalpur.
"
801,"Short term loans have been made available to buy improved wheat seed.
"
802,"Credit facilities will be made available only to those areas where the land reform programme has been effectively implemented.
"
803,"The Bank will also handle the compulsory savings under the land reform programme and credit requirements for land resettlement schemes. It will also assist cottage industry development.
"
804,"The Cooperative Bank will make loans to cooperative societies.
"
805,"Various difficulties facing cooperative development were mentioned earlier.
"
806,"Agricultural development cannot depend on solely cooperative credit.
"
807,"There is no provision to meet the credit needs of agricultural industries which are of major importance to rural development.
"
808,"These include dairying, sheep grazing, etc.
"
809,"During the Third Plan, an agricultural bank will be established to provide credit for the development of commercial agriculture.
"
810,"A sum of Rs 50 million will be made available for lending by the two banks over the next five years. CHAPTER X
"
811,"The Agriculture Census of 1961-62 indicated that 2,011,664 metric tons of food grain (paddy), wheat, maize, millet etc. were produced in Nepal.
"
812,"Although there is an overall surplus of food grain production in Nepal, some areas of the country, particularly Kathmandu Valley and the hill areas, have a deficit.
"
813,"Because of lack of transportation facilities, it is difficult to transport food grain from the Terai to the hills.
"
814,"The surplus production of the Terai is exported southward. If more storage facilities are provided in both surplus and deficit districts, more will be improved into the deficit areas.
"
815,"As there are no quality standards and inspection of food grains, adulteration is practiced to the detriment of the people.
"
816,"If quality controls are effectively imposed, it will be possible to secure higher prices to the cultivators and reduce wastage. The following programmes are included in the Third Plan.
"
817,"Godown Construction
"
818,"The paddy production of the country is 2,200,000 metric tons, in 1964-65 out of which the Terai produces 1,500,000 metric tons. The surplus in this area should be used to supply the deficit hill areas.
"
819,"The surplus can be exported at higher prices.
"
820,"Therefore, His Majesty’s Government has given priority to the construction of godowns during the period. The processing capacity of the rice mills in Nepal is 1,000,000 metric tons of rice from 1,500,000 tons of paddy.
"
821,"In the absence of godowns, the rice and paddy are exported right after they are harvested. Food grains are imported later to meet the requirements of the people.
"
822,"Godowns with a total capacity of 21,575 metric tons have been completed in 12 districts during the Second Plan period. An additional 43,775 metric tons of capacity will be constructed in the hill regions during this plan period.
"
823,"During the first year, 19 godowns, with capacities varying from 75 to 500 metric tons will be built in 13 districts.
"
824,"These will have a total storage capacity of 6,850 tons. In the second year 27 godowns will be constructed in 23 different districts with total storage capacity of 6,850 metric tons.
"
825,"In the third year 11 godowns with a total of 6,000 metric tons will be built during the fourth year. Five godowns with a storage capacity of 2,500 metric tons will be built in four districts.
"
826,"The construction of these godowns should make it possible to meet more adequately the requirement of the hill districts.
"
827,"If the surplus food grains can be stored in Nepal, they can be exported at higher prices. With the completion of these godowns, market prices of food grains can be stabilized since buffer stocks can be maintained.
"
828,"Food Grain Marketing
"
829,"His Majesty’s Government will undertake the distribution of food grains from surplus to deficit district. Government will also export food grains.
"
830,"This activity will be expanded as more experience is acquired and administrative capacity is built up.
"
831,"Food Research
"
832,"The construction of food laboratory will be started during this plan period.
"
833,"Data will be collected on rice milling operations. Research work to reduce food grain damage and loss will be conducted.
"
834,"Studies will be made of possible uses of rice mill waste.
"
835,"The possibility of developing a fruit canning and processing industry will be studied.
"
836,"Experiments on fruit and vegetable preservation processes will be undertaken.
"
837,"Food inspectors will be trained and posted in various districts to prevent adulteration of foodstuff. CHAPTER XI
"
838,"Forestry and Botany
"
839,"Forestry Forests and wild animals are among the important natural resources of Nepal.
"
840,"The major benefits to be accrued from forest are not only soil protection, timber and fuel by also raw materials for local industrial use and for export.
"
841,"Therefore, forest must be carefully planned and managed.
"
842,"Progress in the Second Plan
"
843,"Some of the important forest development achievement during the Second Plan were: Construction of 3840 kilometers of forest demarcation lines in nine hill divisions and thirteen Terai divisions; 448 kilometers of fire lines; 480 kilometers of forest trails; and reforestation on 2,454 hectares in Kathmandu, Trisuli, Chautara, Ilam, Pokhara, Salyan and Lumbini areas.
"
844,"In additionm a survey has been conducted to determine the forest wealth of the country and to create a sound base for forest exploitation.
"
845,"Wild life refuges have been established at Chitwan, Kanchapur and Biratnagar.
"
846,"Under training programme one hundred and twelve rangers and 214 foresters have been trained.
"
847,"Third Plan
"
848,"Projects undertaken during the Second Plan will be continued and other activities will be started.
"
849,"Forest Resources Survey: These are: In order to carry out forest management scientifically after evaluation of the nature and condition of forest and its timber volume as well forest survey undertaken in the Second Plan will be continued.
"
850,"This wills facilities national forest products utilization in the future.
"
851,"Demarcations: The forest boundary demarcation work started to check the misuse of forest and to develop forest resources along scientific line will be continued.
"
852,"As additional 4,000 kilometers of forest demarcation lines will be constructed during the Plan. This will consist of 2400 kilometers in nine hill divisions and 1,600 kilometers in 14 Terai divisions.
"
853,"Fire Production: Four hundred and eighty kilometers miles of fire lines under 16 divisions will be constructed during the Plan to reduce the damage done by fires.
"
854,"During the dry season a team of ten forest guards will be assigned to each division to provide fire protection.
"
855,"Forest Road Construction: Forest roads are essential for forest protection and also transporting the forest products.
"
856,"Moreover, such roads will be constructed in this plan period and steps will be taken to maintain the existing ones.
"
857,"Bridges, culverts and drains will be constructed wherever necessary.
"
858,"During the Plan period, a total of 1200 kilometers of fair weather road will be built.
"
859,"Afforestation: Afforestation programme has been launched in those areas where forests are destroyed annually.
"
860,"Additional 10,121 hectares of land will be afforestated and turned “trail plots” will be established in the Plan period.
"
861,"Wild Life Protection: As present two wild life refuges are under construction to product wild life, particularly the relenocorous. Two more will be constructed during the Plan period.
"
862,"Arrangement will be made establish national parks in protected areas. Soil Protection: In many parts of the Hill region, fertile soil is washed away by water.
"
863,"Forest Research: During the Third Plan three research stations will be established; one each in the Hills, Inner Terai and Teri.
"
864,"Experimental work will be undertaken on different species.
"
865,"The stations will also study soil conditions and forest insects in cooperation with the Agriculture Department.
"
866,"Forest Extension: Many village people of Nepal earn living from the use of neighboring forest areas. To avoid forest depletion, to stimulate village interest protection, and to educate the people on modern tree plantations, a forestry extension programme will be undertaken during the Plan.
"
867,"The requirement of more trained technician is being felt for the protection, exploitation and development of forest resources. The FRI will increase its existing capacity to train more forest experts.
"
868,"Training: Every year 35 rangers and 70 forests will be trained at the center in Hetauda.
"
869,"In addition, short term training will be given to existing staff.
"
870,"More will be sent abroad for advanced training. Miscellaneous: The organization and administration of the Forestry Department will be improved and strengthened.
"
871,"Building will be constructed to meet the requirements of the department.
"
872,"Botany
"
873,"The major objective of the Botany Department is to utilize the country’s medicinal herbs and to create a base for the establishment of pharmaceutical industries.
"
874,"A Botanical Department was established for the utilization and development of the herbs and medicinal plants in Nepal. Because of fund shortage and technical personnels, work could not be started in a systematic order in this field.
"
875,"It was as recently as 1961 that a plan was approved and the department was renamed after the Department of Medicinal Plants. This department is consisted if five section viz.
"
876,"Royal Drug Research Laboratory, Royal Botanical Garden, Herbal Farm, Botanical survey and trading centres.
"
877,"A national botanical survey has been conducted to ascertain the variety of medicinal plants in Nepal.
"
878,"Medicinal plants will be grown on the herbal farms and necessary processing will be undertaken at the laboratory. Farmers will be provided financial and technical assistance to encourage them to grow medicinal plants.
"
879,"Due attention will be paid for the development of this sector in order to strength the economy. Satisfactory progress has been made in the past few years in pharmaceutical development.
"
880,"The Royal Research Laboratory has been established to analyze and conduct experiments on various drugs. Two regional laboratories have been set up at Nepalgunj and Hetauda.
"
881,"In addition seven herbal farms in different climatic regions (Shreepur, Manichuda, Dhunge, Tistung, Daman, Dharan and Hetuda) have been established.
"
882,"Two herbal trading centres at Kathmandu and Nepalgunj have been opened to market processed herbs.
"
883,"During the Second period botanical survey work was undertaken in Kavre Palanchwok, Ramecchap, Okhaldhunga and Bhojpur. In the West the Baglung, Kutinath, Mustang, Jumla, Doti, and Baitadi areas were covered.
"
884,"A survey has been completed in Bardia, in the Terai and in Chisapani Gadi, in Bagmti zone.
"
885,"A botanical garden has been established in Godavari for the protection and demonstration of various plants, compilation and preparation of herberian sheets are being carried out.
"
886,"Third Plan
"
887,"The botanical survey and other development work undertaken in the Second Plan period have created a base for the future programme.
"
888,"During the Third Plan the following activities will be carried forward: Royal Drug Research Laboratory: The activities of the Research Laboratory will be expanded to include experimentation on various drugs.
"
889,"Production of various medicines and useful oils will be undertaken on an experimental basis from the herbs found in Nepal.
"
890,"The Research Laboratory will also provide technical advice concerning the establishment of a pharmaceutical industry in Nepal.
"
891,"Herbal Farms: Measures will be taken to improve the present seven herbal farms and the work of propagating both native and foreign herbs will be continued.
"
892,"In addition five new herbal farms will be established in different climatic regions.
"
893,"During the Plan 5,000 additional acres will be brought under herbal farming.
"
894,"Botanical Survey: The botanical survey, conducted in a few selected areas at present, will be extended to cover the entire country by the end of the Plan period.
"
895,"Information collected by the botanical survey wills republish.
"
896,"Herbal Trading Centres: The work of the Kathmandu and Nepalgunj trading centres has been satisfactory.
"
897,"Five other trading centres will be opened in the Terai during the Plan period.
"
898,"Besides providing incentives to herb growers, technical assistance will be provided to them by such centres.
"
899,"Royal Botanical Gardens: Improvements will be made in the Royal Botanical Garden in Godavari.
"
900,"The garden will be extended and beautified in order to demonstrate both the economic and scenic advantages of herbal fa rming. One lavatory will be set up to find ways and means to protect plants, and greenhouse will be constructed for the preservation of plants.
"
901,"One feru house, one cactus house, two orclid houses, one plan house, one office quarter will be constructed during the Plan period.
"
902,"The extension of workshop, library and sales depot. will be undertaken.
"
903,"Incentive to the Herbal Industries: Simple botanical survey and research work is not sufficient to exploit the herbal resources of the country.
"
904,"Maximum benefits can be derived only from the utilization of knowledge acquired from the survey and research work.
"
905,"During the plan period necessary technical assistance will be provided to investors to open up new industries utilizing medical herbs or plants. CHAPTER XII
"
906,"Irrigation
"
907,"A substantial increase in the productivity of the soil is essential to meet the needs of the people The 10 million Nepalese people depend upon the produce of 2.3 million hectares of land.
"
908,"To make a significant increase in productivity, introduction of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers in essential, but the expansion of irrigation facilities is equally important.
"
909,"The Kosi, Karnali, Gandaki and other rivers provide a continuous flow of water.
"
910,"Large and small river basis range from 1,300 to 6,500 sq. kilometers of territory.
"
911,"When the potential of these rivers is fully realized the quantity of drinking water, irrigation and power available in Nepal will multiply many times over.
"
912,"Present Utilization It is estimated theta boot 25,101 hectares of land were under irrigation prior to the First Plan period.
"
913,"In the fiscal year 1961-62 an additional 26,397 hectares of land were brought under irrigation to make a total of 51,417 hectares land irrigation before the Second Plan.
"
914,"The target of the Second Plan was to irrigate another 57,287 hectares of land.
"
915,"Two third of the target was achieved by the end of the Plan period. The achievements by the end of the Second Plan period are shown in Table 19.
"
916,"Construction of the western Canal of the Kamala River Project and the Khageri Project at Rapti are in process.
"
917,"Preliminary work of the Mohana Canal has also been started.
"
918,"The surveys of the Khatti (Sapatri), Santollar (Palpa), Chope Nahar (Okhldhunga) and Banepa projects were postponed because of technical and technical and transport difficulties. 1Total land area means the total land encompassed by the canal system of each project, although not all such land can be irrigated.
"
919,"Total irrigated land represents that portion which can actually be irrigated.
"
920,"Targets in the Third Plan
"
921,"Emphasis has been laid on irrigation programme to increase agricultural production during the Third Plan period. The growing population demands higher agricultural output from Terai and irrigation opens an important avenue to reach those goals.
"
922,"The Third Plan has a target of bringing irrigation facilities to 177,328 hectares of additional land, including 35,466 hectares to be doubled cropped.
"
923,"Program in the Third Plan
"
924,"During the Third Plan the following projects will be completed:
"
925,"Kamala: Construction of the Kamala Bansje in Dhunkuta district will be completed, bringing new irrigation facilities to 25,506 hectares of land.
"
926,"This project will irrigate 50 per cent of the land in Dhunkuta and Saptari districts.
"
927,"Khagari: This project which is already underway is the first step in irrigating the Rapti Valley, covering 6,070 hectares of land in Chitawan.
"
928,"Tinau East Canal: The Tinau East Canal, built north-east of Bhairahawa, is expected to bring about 5,263 hectares of land under irrigation.
"
929,"Banganga: The Danaganga canal of Taulihawa will irrigate 8,100 hectares of land in Kapilvastu district.
"
930,"Mohana: About 8910 hectares of land in Dhangadhi district will be brought under irrigation by the completion of this project.
"
931,"Bagmati: All the middle portion of Lands not covered by Kamala and Gandak projects will be irrigated by the Bagmati project. This covers 81,000 hectares of land on Rautahat, Bara and Sarlahi districts.
"
932,"The Construction of these projects will be started during the Third Plan period and completed during the Fourth Plan.
"
933,"Gandak: This Project, which is under construction by the Indian Government, is expected to irrigate 65,700 hectares of land in Bara, Parsa and Rautahat district.
"
934,"Chatra: The Chatara canal project is under construction as a part of the Kosi Project….
"
935,"The Project will irrigate 60,150 hectares of land in Sunsari and Morang district.
"
936,"Similar surveys will be completed in the mid-western and hill regions by the end of the Third Plan period. Upon the completion of such surveys hydrological development works will be projected for the country.
"
937,"They include topography survey, geological research of dam sites, collection of hydrological data, and surveys of areas to be irrigated and their cropping patterns.
"
938,"A broad outline of proposed project is prepared on the basis of these results and development costs are estimated.
"
939,"Pre-investment surveys will be conducted in the Sunkosi, Kankai, Babai and Rapti River basins during the Third Plan period.
"
940,"Utilization of Irrigation Facilities
"
941,"Available irrigation facilities in Nepal are not being fully utilized.
"
942,"The growing demands of agricultural production call for maximum utilization of existing irrigation facilities.
"
943,"Stress will be placed upon the repair and maintenance of the existing cannels to derive maximum benefits from them.
"
944,"Assistance will be given to the cultivators to achieve maximum utilization of water resources and will be improved to check the misuse of water.
"
945,"Irrigation facilities can provide benefits to the nation in two ways: first, they add to national production, and second irrigation fees directly increase national revenue.
"
946,"Compared with increases in agricultural production, irrigation fees are relatively minor; they are a source of revenue which must be collected to ensure equitability in benefits from irrigation.
"
947,"The main reason that revenue has been less than the anticipated is that there are no accurate records of land ownership.
"
948,"The land records of Mal Addas cannot be used for revenue purposes because they are not prepared on a geographical basis.
"
949,"The records prepared for tax purposes will be submitted to the district land office. It will be the responsibility of the district administration to maintain proper records and collect land and water taxes.
"
950,"The Panchayat system is not only a form of political organization but also a most suitable and usefu l medium for the over-all development of the country.
"
951,"To succeed, self -reliance among the people must be promoted and a sense of cooperation created among the village, district and zonal panchayat and class organization.
"
952,"Only then can a dynamic society be established which will mobilize the energies and the resources of the people of Nepal for development purpose in an orderly manner. During the Second Plan period various development activities were undertaken at all levels: national, district and village.
"
953,"However, it cannot be said that the panchayat organizations at each level were fully utilized.
"
954,"Attempts were made to involve people directly in local administration and to mobilize resources for local development activities. But the progress was not satisfactory.
"
955,"An effective decentralization programme can not be achieved with just by passing laws regarding decentralization. This must be carefully planned to make the programme a successful and monetary assistance provide district and village panchayats by the central government helped them to perform their routine work were effectively.
"
956,"But such measures left unsolved the relationship between central departments and the district and village panchayats.
"
957,"However, the experience of the Three Year Plan period has been of considerable value in shaping plans, particularly when considered in the light of the report submitted by the Decentralization Commission formed two years age by His Majesty.
"
958,"Objectives of the Third Plan
"
959,"However, no objectives can generally be achieved simply creating a system. Success of the system largely depends on the general population and their cooperation.
"
960,"It demands the cooperation of the general public.
"
961,"The rate of development of any country under any type of administrative.
"
962,"It is true that the appropriate system can easily encourage the awakened society to march ahead.
"
963,"Hence the foremost objectives of the Third Plan in the process of panchayat development is to reorient traditional thinking patterns and promote self-reliance, and create a sense of cooperation to achieve the goals of national development.
"
964,"Decentralization
"
965,"The Panchayat system established by His Majesty is not only a suitable political system but also an important medium of mobilizing the resources and successfully implementing the plan.
"
966,"In accordance with the desire of His Majesty, each and every able citizen of the country must have an opportunity to participate in planning various development activities at all panchayat levels. The success of this system will largely depend on the implementation of the decentralization principle.
"
967,"As long as the panchayats at various levels are not given the authority and responsibility to undertake their own development works, these paanchayats will not serve effectively as a medium of economic development.
"
968,"Therefore, His Majesty’s Government is committed to the task of decentralizing the powers to the panchayats for maximum benefit to the nation.
"
969,"However, the real intent of decentralization may not be achieved simply by delegating authority to the panchayats.
"
970,"The steps must be taken up in an organized and planned manner.
"
971,"In addition to the authority and responsibility given to the panchayats, financial resources must be made available to carry out the development activities.
"
972,"This also calls for training facilities and technical personnel to assist the organization in their new efforts.
"
973,"Implementation of decentralization throughout the kingdom at one time is impossible.
"
974,"Moreover, it is not possible for the central government to pay attention to all levels of the panchayat system at one time.
"
975,"Therefore, an orderly process of decentralization is imperative.
"
976,"Details of the process are given in the Plan Implementation Chapter.
"
977,"It must be mentioned here that the decentralization programme will start first at the district level. The permanent phase of decentralization needs some pre-conditions created and this takes time to achieve.
"
978,"So the decentralization programme has been divided into three successive phases.
"
979,"After the completion of all three phases, all 75 district panchayats of the country will bear considerable administrative responsibility regarding land administration, agriculture, communications, education, health and other development activities.
"
980,"Training
"
981,"The success of the decentralization programme depends largely upon trained personnel.
"
982,"Arrangements will be made to provide training facilities to the official of district and village panchayats.
"
983,"Training will also be provided to selected pancha s and village leaders to make them conscious of their duty and new responsibilities.
"
984,"But the most important task is to form a nucleus team and give them training regarding development programmes to be carried forward in the district.
"
985,"Arrangements will be made to provide two types of training to meet the requirements mentioned above.
"
986,"The first type of training will be given to the officials to be appointed at the district and village level to look after the education, health, postal and other services.
"
987,"A great number of officials will be required at village and district levels to make the Third Plan a success.
"
988,"Some of the official who is already at work also needs training to be more effective.
"
989,"As all the officials cannot be trained at one place 14 training centres will be established in the 14 zones within the next decade.
"
990,"During the Third Plan period, five such centres will be opened. Available resources, including instructors, do not permit establishment of all 14 training centres over the next five years.
"
991,"During the Third Plan, these zonal training centres will train district and village panchayat officials in administration, cooperative organization, education, health, agriculture and other activities The second type of training by such zonal training centres will be provided village leaders and other people.
"
992,"Potential Leaders of class organizations, existing officials of village and district panchayats and others, will receive training regarding the duties and responsibilities of every citizen in the development of the nation.
"
993,"Training facilities should be providing to the class organization workers to enable them to help the people to achieve the goals of decentralization.
"
994,"In total such training will be provided to 9000 individuals from different zones.
"
995,"In addition to the type of training mentioned above, arrangements will be made to hold training session from time to time in remote area of the country to help the people in their day today activities.
"
996,"Such training sessions will be for both men and women and the period of training will vary two weeks to two months. Grants in Aid
"
997,"One of the chief objectives of the decentralization programme is to mobilize local resources for local development work and to use the resources of the central government for purpose of national significance.
"
998,"Therefore, most of the local needs will be met by the resources of village and district panchayats after the completion of all three phases of the decentralization programme.
"
999,"Therefore, the central government will provide only limited financial assistance to selective purpose.
"
1000,"It will take time, however, to decentralization for general administrative and local development costs. Financial help will also be provided to build panchayat buildings.
"
1001,"CHAPTER XIV Industry
"
1002,"The rate of economic development of any nation is related to the expansion of industrial activities.
"
1003,"Industry not only provides employment, but also increases productively and national income by utilizing of available resources. Additional markets for agricultural products are also created.
"
1004,"Thus industrial development and the expansion of agriculture are complement to one another.
"
1005,"Nepal does not have a long history of industrial development.
"
1006,"A few small industries were begun during World War II, but most of them did not survive because of technical and operational difficulties.
"
1007,"Much emphasis was given during the First and Second Plan to establish the preconditions for industrial development.
"
1008,"Communications were expanded and transport and power facilities were improved.
"
1009,"The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) was founded with a view to providing financial and technical assistance to the private sector.
"
1010,"Financial support totaling Rs. 543,000 was extended by NIDC during the First Plan period and Rs 31,600,000 during the Second Plan.
"
1011,"Two industrial estates have been estab lished and steps are being taken to establish a third. At Balaju Industrial Estate, 13 building have been constructed and six firms have begun production.
"
1012,"Construction of the Hetauda Industrial Estate has begun. A number of other factories have been established during the First and Second Plan.
"
1013,"Public sector industries— e.g. sugar, cigarette, leather and shoe constructed with the assistance of friendly nations have started production.
"
1014,"Many units in the sugar, textile, biscuit, woolen textile, leather straw board, carpet, pharmaceutics and re -rolling fields are being set up in the private sector.
"
1015,"The capacity of existing plants producing rice, oil and other products have been increased and steps are being taken to increase the capacity of other e.g. the tourist industry is being stimulated by new hotel construction.
"
1016,"Policies and Priorities Under the Third Plan
"
1017,"The industrial policy of encouraging and providing maximum facilities to provide sector industries will be continued.
"
1018,"Special consideration will be given to increase the productive capacity of existing plants under the industrial development programme.
"
1019,"Emphasis will be given export promotion in order to earn foreign currency so that the capital goods needed for industrial growth can be purchased. To ensure maximum utilization of limited resources, the order of priorities will be as follows:
"
1020,"First, preference will be given to such industries as lumber and plywood, paper, sugar, cement, lime and mica.
"
1021,"Next, industries which will process materials imported in a semi-finished state will be encouraged.
"
1022,"These industries will help to reduce the outlay required for imports.
"
1023,"Third, industries which will displace or reduce the import of products such as textiles, and mustard oil will be given preference where the production costs appear favorable.
"
1024,"Fourth, industries producing products for export— e.g. jute and tea will be encouraged.
"
1025,"New Industrial Units
"
1026,"The Brick and Tile and Agricultural tool factories to be built in the public sector will start production during the Third Plan period.
"
1027,"Cement, lime and mica factories are also to be established in the public sector.
"
1028,"Other industry will be established either in the public sector or the private sector in accordance with the priorities fixed above.
"
1029,"During the Third Plan period, production targets for selected industries will be as follows:
"
1030,"Jute: The Jute industry of Nepal, a major foreign currency earner, now has an annual production capacity of 15,000 metric tons.
"
1031,"This capacity will be doubled during the Third Plan.
"
1032,"Anew jute kill will be constructed at Bhadrapur, once the Mechi Bridge is constructed as a p art the East-West Highway.
"
1033,"Sugar: To meet the increasing demand of sugar and additional 215,000 metric tons of sugar will be produced annually to give a total annual production of 43,000 metric tons.
"
1034,"Cement: A cement factory will be established at Hetauda with a production capacity of 60,000 metric tons.
"
1035,"Paper: A preliminary survey for a paper mill of 15,000 metric tons in the Jhapa district has been completed. Construction of the mill, largely with private capital, is expected during the Third Plan.
"
1036,"Distillery: One alcohol plant will be installed utilizing the by-product, molasses, from the sugar at Birgunj.
"
1037,"Rice and Flour Mills: Mills with a total production capacity of 10,000 metric tons will be established at
"
1038,"Plywood: Plywood factories with a total capacity of 15 million square feet per year will be established in Biratnagar, Hetauda and Dhangadi.
"
1039,"Solvent: A solvent extract factory of 30,000 metric tons annual capacity will be established in Nepalgunj utilizing the by-products of rice mills.
"
1040,"Brewery: A brewery on 1,136,000 liter annual capacity will be constructed either in Nepalgunj, Hetauda or Katmnandu.
"
1041,"Soap: A few soap factories will be set up in Kathmandu and Hetuada. The target is to product 23,000 metric tons of soap per year.
"
1042,"Cold Storage: A cold storage plant of 3,000 metric tons capacity will be installed during the Plan, probably in Kathmandu.
"
1043,"During the Second Plan period, surveys were conducted by NIDC regarding the potential for producing products such as tea, plywood, paper.
"
1044,"Batteries, bone meal, ghee, canned food, carpets and similar items.
"
1045,"During the Third Plan, NIDC and the Department of Industries will continue to press for the establishment of plants to produce these and other products.
"
1046,"In addition, other departments — e.g. Mining, Agriculture, Botany
"
1047,"---are exploring possibilities in their respective fields.
"
1048,"During the Third Plan considerable effort will be made to complete in connection with the following:
"
1049,"1. Sodas ash and chlorine
"
1050,"2. Alcohol
"
1051,"3. Paper
"
1052,"4. Starch and dextrose
"
1053,"5. Lime and cement
"
1054,"6. Glass and ceramics
"
1055,"7. Nitrogenous fertilizer
"
1056,"8. Iron and steel
"
1057,"9. Industrial development states.
"
1058,"Industrial Estates Additional industrial estates will be established in selected areas to facilities industrial expansion.
"
1059,"After detailed study of the availability of power, transport and communication facilities, five new industrial estates will be installed during the Third Plan period in the following locations:
"
1060,"Since its inception in 1959, The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation has been fostering plan development.
"
1061,"It has helped revitalize many antiquated industries and provided financial and technical assistance in establishing new industrial units.
"
1062,"Moreover, it has encouraged industrial research and planning and provided managerial training to many Nepalese.
"
1063,"In the Third Plan, however, these subsidiary activities will be conducted by an Industrial promotion and Productivity Center, to be set up as a subsidiary part of the Corporation.
"
1064,"Financial support provided to private industry by NIDC during the Second Plan period is shown in Table 22.
"
1065,"During the Third Plan, the activities of NIDC will be expanded to provide maximum technical and financial assistance to private businessmen .
"
1066,"Private businessmen have agreed to invest Rs. 20,500,000 in addition to Rs 20,940,000 made by NIDC during the Second Plan period.
"
1067,"In addition to the investment made to encourage private businessmen NIDC has also invested Ts. 5,124,320 in the Balaju and Hetauda industrial estates.
"
1068,"Organizational Changes and Training
"
1069,"Necessary steps will be taken to improve the organization and operation of existing and newly created industries in the public sector so that maximum efficiency may be achieved.
"
1070,"Feasibility and pre-investment studies will be conducted with considerable care in connection with proposals for new industries of the expansion of those now in existence.
"
1071,"Both the short and long term requirements of industrial growth must be recognized.
"
1072,"Trained and experienced personnel are required in both public and private industry and these requirements will increase many- fold in the years ahead.
"
1073,"Therefore, training facilities will be expanded substantially during the Third Plan.
"
1074,"As already noted, the training program of NIDC will be given increased emphasis.
"
1075,"Two training centers are being established in Kathmandu to train technicians skilled in operating and maintaining power and machine equipment.
"
1076,"A training program will also be established in the Hetuada Industrial Estate.
"
1077,"CHAPTER XV
"
1078,"Cottage and Small Scale Industries Cottage industries can play a strategic role in a predominantly agricultural country.
"
1079,"A large section of the peasant population is occupied in farming for only a few months of the years. Cottage industry can provide the farmers with employment and income during of off-season.
"
1080,"Articles of daily consumption can be produced with a small amount of capital. Hand woven textiles, straw baskets, canned food, brass containers and souvenirs for tourists are some of the items that can be produced on a cottage industry basis in Nepal.
"
1081,"Competitions from large scale machine methods of production are keen.
"
1082,"But if care is used in establishing cottage industries where the market prospects are good and under circumstances in which both the capital outlay and the opportunity cost of labour are low, this method of production can be a profitable undertaking.
"
1083,"Progress in the Second Plan
"
1084,"During the Second Plan period, 1800 people received training in cottage industry methods and techniques.
"
1085,"This training was provided by the Cottage Industries Training Centre in Kathmandu and by the various training centers established in the zones.
"
1086,"Due to lack of capital and administrative and organizational difficulties, not all of the trainees found employment.
"
1087,"Under circumstances which would permit those to utilize the skills acquired.
"
1088,"As a consequence, it is clear that the Cottage Industry Programme fell short of its goals. Objectives in the Third Plan
"
1089,"Under the Third Plan, the Objectives will be as follows:
"
1090,"Programme in the Third Plan
"
1091,"To achieve the above objectives, the following programmes will be undertaken:
"
1092,"Arrangements will also be made for government departments and agencies
"
1093,"New design will also be created and introduced to produce attractive articles.
"
1094,"Service Centers: Service centers will be established in different parts of the country to provide central technical services such as calendaring and finishing operations for the textile industry.
"
1095,"Karkhana Fail and Orphan Welfare Centre: Existing programmes which provide technical training to prisoners and orphan children will be extended.
"
1096,"These programmes help such individuals to become usefu l citizens of Nepal.
"
1097,"Such programmes will be run by a Board instead of the Department itself.
"
1098,"Credit and Cooperative Organization: Production of handloom textiles, baskets, woolen goods, clay products, and thus become eligible for credit from the Cooperative Bank.
"
1099,"During the Third Plan, the Cooperative Bank intends to provide credit totaling Rs. 12,600,000 to 84 cottages and small scale industries.
"
1100,"This and small scale industries. This will be of great assistance in the cooperative organization of craftsmen.
"
1101,"Such societies will be autonomous bodies based on democratic and cooperative principles.
"
1102,"Each society will be owned collectively by the members and managed by a managing committee elected by the members.
"
1103,"In due course of time, there will be an organization at the national level which will have the responsibility of providing raw materials and facilities the marketing products of the Societies.
"
1104,"CHAPTER XVI The Mineral Industry
"
1105,"Mineral reserves may prove to be an important national resource for Nepal.
"
1106,"But knowledge of the location, quality and quantity of these reserves is limited.
"
1107,"As a result, very little development has occurred.
"
1108,"Progress to Date
"
1109,"A geological survey of about 150 square kilometers of territory has been completed.
"
1110,"In addition investigations have been made of the following:
"
1111,"1. Godavari marble mine
"
1112,"2. Copper mines of Kulekhani, Arkhouli and Fikkal
"
1113,"3. Cobalt mines of Summer-Bhavar, Netadarling and Nagre Bharle areas
"
1114,"4. Placer gold in Kali Gandaki basin
"
1115,"5. Coal and Gas of Kathmandu Valley
"
1116,"6. Iron ores of Phulchowki and Lobi River
"
1117,"7. Oil Deposit in Dailekh 8. Shale in the area of the Bander River
"
1118,"In addition, pre-investment surveys have been conducted in the following places:
"
1119,"1. Mica deposits in Nuwakot and Ramechhap
"
1120,"2. Limestone deposits in Kathmandu and near Hetauda
"
1121,"3. Copper refining unit in Wapsa and Okhaldhunga.
"
1122,"Technical assistance has been made available for the small workshops of that area.
"
1123,"4. Thosey Iron Ores: Construction of a laboratory and staff quarters gas been completed.
"
1124,"The laboratory is limited to the chemical, metallurgical and geological research branches.
"
1125,"Research work and analysis of sample submitted by both public and private sector industries were conducted.
"
1126,"Third Plan Priority has been given to the geological survey activities during the Third Plan period.
"
1127,"Preliminary surveys will be conducted to explore the basic mineral resources available. The United Nations is providing technical experts to assist in this undertaking.
"
1128,"Once the preliminary geological survey locates mineral deposits, an intensive survey will be undertaken in the second phase to determine quantity, quality and other basic information.
"
1129,"Moreover, during the Plan period, attention will be given to the preparation of geological maps of those areas feasible for commercial exploitation.
"
1130,"In addition, preliminary as well as detailed survey work will be continued for mineral oil and gases in Piuthan, Chisapani, Jhapa and Morang districts.
"
1131,"A detailed survey of copper deposits in Eastern Nepal will be completed during the Plan period.
"
1132,"Field surveys of placer gold in the basins of the Gandhaki and Rapti rivers will be continued. Work will also be undertaken to find other metals such as cobalt, nickel, etc.
"
1133,"A study will be completed during the first year of the Third Plan to determine whether the production of mica is feasible on a commercial basis in Easter and western Nepal.
"
1134,"Because of the increasing demand for construction materials in Nepal, detailed studies will be made of lime, limestone, Chinese clay, quartz and other deposits.
"
1135,"Accordingly a survey of limestone at Bhainse and Kathmandu and of sand and quartz for glass production at Hetuada and Kathmandu will be conducted.
"
1136,"The above efforts will be of great importance in establishing mineral industries in the Fourth plan period.
"
1137,"Buildings for the Research Laboratory and associated Research Centers will be completed and modern analytical equipment will be installed. CHAPTER XVII
"
1138,"Tourism and Archaeology
"
1139,"Tourism
"
1140,"Tourism is an important source of national income and foreign exchange for many countries of the world.
"
1141,"Tourism is increasing in popularity and the inflow of tourists into Nepal is rapidly rising.
"
1142,"Adequate transport facilities and modern hotel arrangements are necessary conditions for the development of tourism.
"
1143,"Inadequate air transport and hotel facilities in Nepal have become the bottleneck to its development.
"
1144,"However, the efforts made during the Second Plan period helped greatly to overcome such difficulties.
"
1145,"During the Third Plan, therefore, greater stress will be placed on increasing air transport and hotel facilities in order to derive the maximum benefits from tourism.
"
1146,"During the First Plan the Tourist Department was established and the Tourist Information Centre opened.
"
1147,"As a result the increasing number of the hotels in Kathmandu, and such other facilities Tourists increased from 2,056 in 1958 to 5,954 in 1961 and 9,976 in 1964. The details are given in Table 23.
"
1148,"As present, 270 hotel beds are available and additional 400 hotel beds will become available after the completion of two hotels now under construction in Kathmandu.
"
1149,"Buildings at Kakani, Pokhara, Daman, Lumbini and Nagarkot have also been constructed for tourists.
"
1150,"Third Plan
"
1151,"It is estimated that by the last year of the Third Plan, 20,000 tourists will be visiting Nepal.
"
1152,"The construction of Gaucher Runway is expected to be completed Hotel capacity will be doubled after the completion of hotels which are under construction at present.
"
1153,"In addition, the construction of a new hotel with modern fitting and facilities is planned.
"
1154,"Hotel of international standard will be constructed at Biratnagar and Pokhara.
"
1155,"Internal transport facilities will also be expanded.
"
1156,"To provide facilities to visitors traveling over Tribhuwan Rajpath by car, the construction of an office building in Birgunj is envisaged under this programme.
"
1157,"The representatives of the concerned offices of HMG will be the staff of this office in order to help tourists with customs and immigration formalities before entering Nepal.
"
1158,"A building will be constructed in Kathmandu to house the Department of Tourism and the central offices of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation.
"
1159,"To further publicize Nepal on international scale films of Nepalese attraction will be made and distributed.
"
1160,"Tourist literature will also be distributed.
"
1161,"Sight seeing in Nepal is not only limited but also expensive.
"
1162,"The Department of Tourism will develop sight seeing facilities in Kathmandu.
"
1163,"Tourists are national guests and the responsibility of inviting them to Nepal falls not only on he Department but also upon all Government officers and other related agencies.
"
1164,"All visitors coming in both on official and non-official capacity must be treated well to make them feel comfortable and at home.
"
1165,"Attempts will be made to simplify legal and administrative procedures so that a minimum of inconvenience will occur.
"
1166,"Archaeology
"
1167,"The ancient history of Nepal is glorious.
"
1168,"But research required to record this past is of recent origin.
"
1169,"Recently the Archaeology Department was created to preserve objects of historical importance.
"
1170,"The Department has conducted the excavation and study of about 60 historical places in the last three years.
"
1171,"Many antiques have been discovered at six of these places— e.g. at Tilaurakot the remains of a civilization dating back to 600 B. C. has been found.
"
1172,"Excavations at Hadigaun and Lazimpat in the valley have been completed.
"
1173,"The remnants of a 1400 year old civilization have been found at Hadigaun.
"
1174,"Surveys of the Chovar cave in Kathmandu Valley and the Mahendra cave in Pokhara have been completed.
"
1175,"Records of the numerous temples of the Valley have been collected.
"
1176,"AT present there are six museums under the Archaeology Department.
"
1177,"Thirty-one books have been published in the Departmental publication series. Other Publications will report the research done by the Department.
"
1178,"Third Plan Preservation of Temples: Several temples and other old artifacts are major tourist attraction in the
"
1179,"Valley.
"
1180,"These are not properly maintained at present; extensive renovation and continued maintenance are urgently needed.
"
1181,"Plans to preserve these historical objects, therefore, will be implemented in three Durbar Squares.
"
1182,"Preservation of Historical Museum: A plan has been worked out to preserve different places of historical importance, including Lumbani, Kapilvasto, and the birth place of Lord Buddha.
"
1183,"National Archives Building: The construction of a national archives building will be completed during the first year of the Third Plan.
"
1184,"The building will be well furnished and a system of keeping the records of all objects of historical importance in a scientific and modern method will be followed.
"
1185,"Lumdini: A master plan will be prepared for the future development of Lumbini garden.
"
1186,"Necessary steps will be taken to receive financial assistance form different Buddhist Associations of friendly nations to construct and establish a library in Lumbini.
"
1187,"The archaeological excavation and research work will be expanded during the Third Plan period.
"
1188,"Results of such work will be published.
"
1189,"Archeologists will be encouraged to undertake research and excavation work of historical places.
"
1190,"CHAPTER XVIII
"
1191,"Foreign Trade Foreign trade is of strategic importance in this age of increasing mutual relationship and cooperation among the various countries.
"
1192,"It is especially important for the developing countries since they have to import new techniques technical knowledge and many products from developed countries.
"
1193,"From the long term point of view, trade can contribute greatly to the economic development of a country. External markets are large relative to its domestic market, and the cost of imports can be offset by expanding exports.
"
1194,"Hence, it would not be wrong to say that trade development is an integral part of planning for economic development.
"
1195,"Growth of Foreign Trade
"
1196,"In the present Nepalese economy, international trade plays but a limited role.
"
1197,"Available statistical data in the field of trade are not adequate.
"
1198,"Nevertheless, the growth of trade in recent years has been sufficient to justify considerable optimism regarding future prospects.
"
1199,"As tables in the appendix reveal, the volume of foreign trade has increased three times within five years: imports have risen 281 percent and exports 362 percent.
"
1200,"Characteristics of Trade
"
1201,"Eighty-five percent of Nepalese exports consist of food and raw materials.
"
1202,"In 1961-62, food alone made up 65 percent of total exports.
"
1203,"But the exports of finished goods have been expanding only 1.5 percent of total exports in 1957-58 consisted of finished goods, and then had raised to 13 percent by 1961-62.
"
1204,"Seventy percent of total imports consist of food, cigarettes, finished products, gasoline, oil and other minor items.
"
1205,"In the last few years, though the imports of finished consumption goods have increased, imports of food have decreased.
"
1206,"Imports of goods related to industrial development have been increasing.
"
1207,"It is obvious from this short summary that Nepal, like many other developing countries, depends on the export of primary goods and the import of consumer goods and producer goods.
"
1208,"Fluctuations in the rise of primary goods and increases in the imports of consumer and producer goods may have adverse effects upon the Nepalese development effort if corrective measures are not taken.
"
1209,"Most of Nepalese trade i.e. more than 90 percent is with India.
"
1210,"Trade with China is still relatively small. Trade with overseas countries is very small, although it has been increasing during the last few years.
"
1211,"Nepal exports jute and jute goods to overseas countries and imports construction materials, producer and consumer goods from these countries.
"
1212,"Imports of capital goods will continue to increase, a part of which must come from hard currency areas.
"
1213,"Therefore, to meet hard currency payments, exports to overseas countries must be increased.
"
1214,"Balance of International Trade
"
1215,"Table 24 shows that there has been a deficit every year on the balance of international trade.
"
1216,"This deficit may be overstated because the statistical data are not complete.
"
1217,"There is no record, for example, of some of the export of timber, leather and jute on which custom duties are not levied.
"
1218,"As discussed elsewhere foreign exchange holdings of the Nepal Rastra Bank, particularly of Indian currency, have been increasing.
"
1219,"Although foreign aid and domestic monetary policy have also had an impact upon these holdings it seems reasonable to conclude that had there been continuous and severe trade deficits, these holdings would have been much less.
"
1220,"Nevertheless it is necessary to stress that, on the basis of data available the international trade balances have been unfavorable.
"
1221,"Some improvement has become evident during that last few years, partly because prices of exportable goods have risen, but also because quantities exported have increased.
"
1222,"Foreign Trade in the Third Plan Given the foregoing characteristics of Nepalese trade, the following policies will be stressed in the Third
"
1223,"Plan:
"
1224,"Increase in Exports
"
1225,"Efforts will be made to increase exports by 100 per cent within the coming five years.
"
1226,"It is obvious that since import of production goods from development countries will be increasing, exports to overseas countries should be increased as much as possible.
"
1227,"To achieve these objectives, production of exportable goods such as paddy, jute, oilseeds, etc, will be increased and special attention given to those which can be exported to overseas countries.
"
1228,"At the same time, attempts will be made to improve the quality of export goods.
"
1229,"Change in the Volume of Imports
"
1230,"To reduce the foreign trade deficit, it is anticipated that the volume of imports must also be reduced, in addition to expanding exports. To achieve development goals, however, imports of capital goods must increase.
"
1231,"Therefore, to reduce imports as a whole emphasis must be placed upon reducing consumer goods imports.
"
1232,"As a compensating measure, domestic production of consumer goods imports.
"
1233,"During the Second Plan, this objective was fulfilled to some extent through the constr4uction of the sugar, cigarette and shoe factories.
"
1234,"The Private sector has also stepped up the production of consumer goods. Additional measures will be undertaken during the Third Plan, as noted in the chapter on industry.
"
1235,"Diversifying Trade with Developed Countries
"
1236,"In recent years, the volume of imports form China and the USSR have been increasing.
"
1237,"But this has been in the form of aid instead of trade.
"
1238,"During the Third Plan, attempts will be made to further diversify trade by trade treaties with overseas and developed countries by other measure.
"
1239,"In the country at present, there is still a lack of the necessary conditions for trade.
"
1240,"Transportation, banking and insurance facilities are not adequate.
"
1241,"Improvements in these fields must precede large increases in trade.
"
1242,"In the Third Plan period, steps will be taken to overcome these short comings. CHAPTER XIX
"
1243,"Power
"
1244,"Power is a basic requirement in the economic development of any country.
"
1245,"In Nepal, there hydroelectric power potential is immense because of abundant water resources.
"
1246,"However, development to date is not satisfactory and serious thought has to be given power development during the Third Plan period.
"
1247,"Lack of adequate transport facilities, hydrological survey data and technicians cause many bottlenecks. Yet the efforts made are not discouraging.
"
1248,"The total power at the beginning of the Second Plan was less than 10,000 kilowatts.
"
1249,"The Second Plan set a target of generating an additional 30,000 kilowatts by implementing various projects to meet the growing demand for power.
"
1250,"Thus installation of associated transmission lines and improvements in distribution systems was also included in the Plan.
"
1251,"It is now estimated that during the Second Plan power capacity was increased by only 7,500 kilowatts by the various projects which were implemented. The first phase of Trisuli Hydel Project could not be completed.
"
1252,"Only one unit of the projects was installed during the Second Plan. This unit designed to provide an additional 3,000 kilowatts of power will not be in production until late 1965.
"
1253,"Other projects completed, or nearly so, during the Second Plan are Panauti (2,400 kilowatts) and the Birgunj and Patan diesel plants (2000 kilowatts).
"
1254,"In addition, considerable progress has been made in installing diesel plants in Biratnagar and Hetauda.
"
1255,"Hydrological survey has also been conducted on the Karnali, Kulekhni and Other rivers.
"
1256,"Third Plan
"
1257,"To determine the demand of industrial concerns and households for power a plan has been framed dividing the country in three broad sections: Eastern, Central and Western.
"
1258,"Projections regarding the future development of industries and population growth have been prepared for each and power requirements estimated.
"
1259,"On the basis of this, a target of installing power capacity totaling 60,000 kilowatts has been set for the Second Plan.
"
1260,"Central Section
"
1261,"The present total available power supply in the Central section, comprising the areas of Kathamndu, Birgunj and Hetauda, is 12,000 kilowatts.
"
1262,"It is estimated that at least 60,000 kilowatts will be needed by the end of this Plan period. The following power projects, after their completion, will produce additional power to meet the growth power demand:
"
1263,"In addition, the Gandaki Project which is being constructed by the Government of India is expected to provide 10,000 kilowatts of power to Nepal by the end of the Third Plan.
"
1264,"Even then, the combined output of all these projects will not be enough to meet the requirements noted above. The installation of another power plant is essential.
"
1265,"A detailed survey for power plants on the Marsyandi, Kali and the Kulekhani rives and for another plant on Trisuli rivers will be conducted in the first year of the Plan.
"
1266,"The power plants selected for construction will presumably be large enough to provide the additional power needed during the Plan period.
"
1267,"The new project will generate at least 16,000 kilowatt of power by the end of the Plan period.
"
1268,"The construction of 66 KV transmission line and substations Kathmandu, Hetauda and Birgunj will be completed.
"
1269,"Additional 11 KV and 33 KV transmission lines and substations will also be installed. Upon completion of these projects power distribution in Kathmandu Valley will be through 220 volt lines.
"
1270,"Transmissions lossed which are now estimated to be 40 percent will be reduced to 10 per cent. Survey will also be conducted in the Bhairawa, Butwal.
"
1271,"Bharatpur and Hetauda areas and a transmission system (or systems) designed accordingly.
"
1272,"Eastern Section
"
1273,"Installed power capacity today is 5,000 kilowatts. Compared with future requirements, this is a negligible amount.
"
1274,"Generating capacity totaling 9,000 kilowatts will be made available during the Third Plan.
"
1275,"This will include a 1,470 kilowatts diesel plant at Biratnagar and 7,500 kilowatts form the Kosi Project; both of which are now under construction.
"
1276,"To provide still more power for the estaer sector, hydrological data will be collected for the Kanaki and other fivers of the region and at least preliminary development planas prepared.
"
1277,"It is anticipated; however that actual construction of these additional plants will be installed, therefore, to meet the power requirements of towns in Jhapa, Illam and Saptari districts on a temporary basis through NIDC assistance. To link the Kosi generating plant with Biratnagar, a transmission line will also be constructed.
"
1278,"Western Section
"
1279,"Power facilities in the western section are almost non-existent at present. One diesel plant with a capacity of 500 kilowatt will be constructed in Nepalgunj in the first year of the Plan period.
"
1280,"Since there is little possibility of starting hydroelectric projects in the near future, small diesel plants will be installed to meet the growing demands for power.
"
1281,"The major effort in the West will be to complete the study of the Karnali river and to begin construction of the first phase.
"
1282,"Organization Reforms
"
1283,"Measures will be taken to improve the administration of the Department of Electricity and the Electricity Corporation to coordinate the effects of the two organizations.
"
1284,"Establishment of a central power Authority is under consideration. Its purpose would be to prepare a long term master plan for the production and distribution of power and to supervise the power generating units in the eastern section.
"
1285,"Transport
"
1286,"Transportation has a strategic role to play to bring about efficiency and coordination in administration and to increase the volume of internal trade.
"
1287,"Both are essential to the process of industrialization. Priority was given to transportation in the First and Second Plan, but the headway made so far is negligible in comparison to our needs.
"
1288,"The mountainous terrain of Nepal makes construction of reads a difficult job; the development of a railway system is quite impossible; and air transportation is very expensive. In this situation plans for the development of the transport system of Nepal must be prepared both from a short term and a long term point of view.
"
1289,"With these objectives in mind His Majesty’s Government invited thee International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to survey the existing transport system, make projections regarding future needs, and prepare a master plan for transport development.
"
1290,"The following elements of the plan for transport are based upon the study. Road Construction in the First and Second Plan
"
1291,"Before the launching of First Plan the total length of all roads in Nepal was 624 kilometers. Including of 368 km. of fair-weather roads.
"
1292,"The First Five Year Plan set a target of building 1440 more km, including 480 km. of metal led roads and 960 km. fair weather roads. In 1958, the Regional Transport Organization (RTO) was established in a tripartite agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Governments of India and the Unites States to construct these roads.
"
1293,"The targets was to build 1440 km. of roads, including 320 km. of all weather roads were constructed.
"
1294,"East-West Highway
"
1295,"The construction of 381 km. of roads stretching from Mechi in the east to Adhawar in the west will be completed during the Plan period.
"
1296,"This will line all important towns, production centres and markets of the eastern Terai with Kathmandu, since the Raxual-Kathmandu roadway joins the East-West Highway.
"
1297,"The existing portion of the East-West Highway, Stretching from Hetauda to Narayan Gadh, will be improved.
"
1298,"From Narayan Gadha west to Butwal the road will be extended on a fair-weather basis, Survey, design and cost estimates will be completed on the remaining portion running 432 km. west from Butwal to Banbass.
"
1299,"Thus, by the end of the Third Plan period, nearly 50 per cent of the 1040 km.
"
1300,"East-West Highway will be completed.
"
1301,"Raxaul-Kathmandu-Kodari Road
"
1302,"The Kathmandu-Kodari road upon its completion during the Third Plan will link the capital city of Kathmandu with Kodari, a town on the Chinese border.
"
1303,"Kathmandu is already linked with Raxaul on the Indian border including Raxaul to Amlekgang 39 km. and Hetauda to Bhainse 19 km.
"
1304,"Further improvements will be made of 5.8 km during the Third Plan, particularly in the Raxual-Bahinse sector.
"
1305,"A traditional trade rout e for foot- traffic exists in west-central Nepal, connecting the towns of Bhairawa in the south (near an Indian railhead) with Botwal, Tansen, Pokhara and other trade areas in the hills.
"
1306,"This road, 205 km. long, will be completed during the Third Plan. Kathmandu=Pokhara
"
1307,"A road now exists connecting Kathmandu with Trisuli, 69 km. to the northwest.
"
1308,"This road will be made an all-weather road during the Third Plan. It will also be extended, on a fair-weather basis, west to Pokhara, thus connecting two major hill communities directly by a road through the hills .
"
1309,"Therefore, 15 bridges will be constructed during the Third Plan.
"
1310,"Aid to Panchayat for the Construction of Local Roads
"
1311,"The Roads Department will provide financial and technical assistance to different village and district panchayats to help them build local road.
"
1312,"For the most part, local resources will construct these roads, but governmental aid will be of great importance in providing proper technical guidance and in supplying construction items not available locally.
"
1313,"Miscellaneous
"
1314,"During this Plan period, a material laboratory will be established to study and test construction materials.
"
1315,"The laboratory will also make the results of its research available to concerned departments.
"
1316,"Several buildings for divisional offices of the Road Department will be constructed in different parts of the country.
"
1317,"This will enable them to supervise the construction of new roads and the repairs and maintenance of roads in the several divisions more efficiently.
"
1318,"His Majesty’s Government has created a new division under the Roads Department to work out future plans and to conduct surveys for road construction in various parts Nepal.
"
1319,"Such activities will be expanded during the Plan period.
"
1320,"Provision for Vehicles
"
1321,"Mere construction of roads is not enough in Nepal. Proper utilization of roads is also required.
"
1322,"As the Government has to concentrate its efforts on construction, the policy is for automobile and most of the truck and bus services to be provided by private individuals and companies.
"
1323,"Investments, particularly in trucks and buses, will be encouraged through existing financial institutions. Air Transport
"
1324,"It will take considerable time and resources to develop roads in Nepal. Air transport therefore, will remain important as a means of providing access to the hill areas of Nepal.
"
1325,"Progress to Date
"
1326,"Before the launching of the First Five Year Plan, air services were available only in five places: Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bhairawa, Simra and Birtnagar.
"
1327,"In addition, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation was established to provide regular air services. Improvements on the Kathmandu, Biratnagar and Bhairawa airfields were made.
"
1328,"Of the remaining two airports, surveys and construction work will be completed at Doti airfield.
"
1329,"As the present Pokhara airfield is not properly located for use by large planes, plans will be developed to construct a new strip about 4 miles east of the present one.
"
1330,"Construction of the Gaucher cross-runway will be completed by the end of the first year of the Plan.
"
1331,"Since Gaucher Airport is the most important airfields in Nepal. Attempt must be made to make it s modern one.
"
1332,"A master plan for development and modernization will be prepared by consulting firm and work begun to turn the prese4nt Gaucher Airport into a modern international.
"
1333,"A new terminal building, two hangers, a car parking lot and a new road leading to the airport are all under construction and will be completed early in the Third Plan.
"
1334,"At other airports, Bharatpur, Dang, Gorkha and Dhangadhi, terminal buildings, staff quarters and other facilities will be constructed to bring the entire air transport system of Nepal up to as high a standard as resources and experience will permit.
"
1335,"Construction of 20 small airstrips will be undertaken in the hilly regions of Nepal where large planes cannot land.
"
1336,"In the First year of the Plan, steps will be taken to locate suitable places and acquire land.
"
1337,"Four strips will be constructed in the second year and another 16 by the end of the Plan period.
"
1338,"This will provide needed transport facilities in the hill areas and make it possible to step up the rate of development considerably.
"
1339,"The Civil Aviation Department will be strengthened and improved.
"
1340,"Its responsibilities include the construction and maintenance of all the airfields in the country and the operation of the air communication system.
"
1341,"The Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) will be provided both technical and financial assistance to strengthen the organization and to make air service more effective and efficient.
"
1342,"Depending upon the traffic and financial support available, form one to three new faster planes will be purchased for external flights. Present Dakota planes will continue to be used for internal flights.
"
1343,"Repair and maintenance facilities will be expanded and improved.
"
1344,"Training for RNAC staff will be conducted in Nepal and both flight and service personnel will be sent abroad for advanced training. A new central office will construct for the airline.
"
1345,"Twelve staffs quarter and storage facilities for fuel, spare parts and equipment will be located at various airports.
"
1346,"New buses for passengers will be provided in Calcutta. Patna, New Delhi, Simra, Biratnagaar, Bhairawa and Kathmandu.
"
1347,"Railway Transport
"
1348,"In India railways occupy a prominent place in transportation services.
"
1349,"In Nepal, however, it is very difficult to construct railway: only two lines exist at present.
"
1350,"One runs from Raxaul to Amlikhgunj, a distance of 29 miles.
"
1351,"The other links Jayanagar to Janakpur.
"
1352,"Both link points in Nepal to Indian railheads.
"
1353,"Although the Raxaul- Amlikhgunj line was of considerable importance when first constructed in 1927, traffic on the Raxaul-Kathmandu road opened in 1956 has reduced its significance in the transport system.
"
1354,"Programme in the Third Plan Construction of Railway Terminal in Birgunj: Goods coming from the Indian meter-gauge railway at
"
1355,"Raxaul are unloaded before being shifted to the Raxaul-Amlikhgunj railway or to trucks for transport to various points in Nepal.
"
1356,"The Nepalese customs checkpoint is at Birgunj just across the border from Raxaul. Much confusion, revenue loss and damage to goods now occur because of the repeated loading and unloaded easily.
"
1357,"Custom facilities will also be constructed near the present Nepalese railway station.
"
1358,"N.F.F.R. : As there is no proramme to construct roads from Jayanagar to Janakpur are present, the railroad connecting these points is expected to continue to carry considerable freight and passengers.
"
1359,"Plans will be development to improve existing facilities and possibly to extend the line to Chissapani.
"
1360,"Ropeway: In view of the hilly topography of the country and the relative cheapness of ropeway transportation, the ropeways, can become an important means of transport.
"
1361,"The Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway had demonstrated the economic benefits of ropeway. However, in the absence of detailed surveys it is not possible to determine the economically beneficial sites for the ropeways.
"
1362,"Therefore, in this plan, programmes have been made for surveys.
"
1363,"Once the sites are determined, construction can be undertaken later.
"
1364,"National Transport Organization
"
1365,"Recently a National transport organization has been established to maximize the utilization of the transport resources of the country.
"
1366,"The principle objective of the organization is to effectively coordinate the ropeway, railway and other means of transportation in the Bagmati and Narayani zones. Moreover, the Organization will provide facilities and guidance to different transport organization in the private sector.
"
1367,"As governmental and commercial decentralization increase throughout the country, there must be effective communication links between the center and the district.
"
1368,"Postal Services
"
1369,"The first postal service was begun in 1875.
"
1370,"About 100 post offices were then established. Thee main objective was internal administration and national security.
"
1371,"Just prior to the first Plan the number of post offices had risen to only 124.
"
1372,"During the First Plan Nepal acquired membership in the International Postal Union.
"
1373,"In the Three Year Plan period, emphasis was lid on consolidation of the existing postal system.
"
1374,"The General Post Office the center was expanded and seven Zonal Post Officers were established to supervise and control the postal services between zones.
"
1375,"Now there are 4 City Post Officers, 9 Central Post Officers and 153 Branch Post Offices in the country.
"
1376,"In addition, there are three Post Offices, which is now responsible for foreign postal services.
"
1377,"There are three mail routes (1) Western Hill Route; (2) Eastern Hill Route; (3) eastern Hill route.
"
1378,"These routes are connected to branch lines. Internal letter insurance and internal parcel insurance and internal parcel insurance services have been recently started.
"
1379,"In order to utilize the facilities available under the International Postal Union, Nepal has reached agreements with India and China and is negotiating with Pakistan, the United States and the United Kingdom.
"
1380,"Third Plan
"
1381,"The number of post offices is insufficient for present needs.
"
1382,"Therefore, the post offices will be increased and existing officers expanded and improved.
"
1383,"The organization of the postal system will be modified and other steps taken to improve efficiency and service.
"
1384,"Highlights of the program are as following: Organization: An effective administrative system is the precondition for an expansion of postal services.
"
1385,"To achieve a greater degree of specialization, the total postal system will be subdivided into administrative postal services categories.
"
1386,"Seven more Supervisory Post Offices at zonal level will be establishing.
"
1387,"At the district 28 Superintending Offices will be established which will work as a link between the Zonal Supervisory Office and the operating offices.
"
1388,"Branch Post Offices: According to the Postal Survey Reports prepared during the Second Plan, there should be one Post Office to cover an area to 110 square miles.
"
1389,"Therefore, 130 more post offices will be required.
"
1390,"Of these, 85 will be established in the Third Plan period. in deciding upon the location of these new post offices, area and population to be served and existing postal facilities will be taken into account.
"
1391,"Cooperative Post Offices: The first Cooperative post offices was established in 1957 and increased to 150 by 1961.
"
1392,"Existing routes will also be studied and necessary changes will be made.
"
1393,"Inspections of Mail Services: The people are the ultimate sufferers from theft and careless handling of mail. Faith in the reliability of the postal services diminishes.
"
1394,"These inspectors will be posted at first in Kathmandu and the number will then be increased to cover different parts of the country.
"
1395,"Money Orders: Money order service is only possible it inspection of mail is effective.
"
1396,"The operation of a money order services will thus be undertaken in the second year of the Plan, after the mail inspection program has been implemented.
"
1397,"Philatelic Scheme: This scheme will be made more effective in order to get maximum advantage for the sale of postage stamps.
"
1398,"A variety of postage stamps in attractive design will be printed so as to increase income.
"
1399,"Telecommunication Use of telephone and wireless service was limited to a few districts of Nepal at the beginning of the first Plan.
"
1400,"Some 300 line were operating in Kathnamdu. During the First Plan, a modern automatic system with a capacity of 3,000 lines was installed in Kathmandu.
"
1401,"There were all in use within a short period.
"
1402,"Shortly after World War II, wireless sets were installed were installed in 28 districts. These were replaced by new sets in 35 district beginning in the latter part of the First Plan.
"
1403,"Three Year Plan Progress In the field of wireless installation, seven zonal area control stations were established, and 50 wireless cenrters under these control stations were also installed.
"
1404,"An international telecommunication system was completed with two circuits linking from Kathmandu, Delhi and Calcutta.
"
1405,"With the establishment of two teleprinter centers, prompt communication of news from foreign countries has become possible
"
1406,"The existing 1,000 telephone lines at Kathmandu have proved insufficient, and steps have been taken to add some 4,000 more lines.
"
1407,"Installation of a 300 lines system with a local exchange at Biratnagar has been completed and will start functioning during the first year of the Third Plan period.
"
1408,"The Nepal-Pak telecommunication project is nearing completion and will start functioning at the beginning of the Third Plan.
"
1409,"The Program in the Third Plan
"
1410,"The following telecommunication projects will be carried out during the Third Plan:
"
1411,"Completion of Present Schemes: Installation of an additional 4,000 lines in Kathmandu, plus a 600 lines exchange at Patan will be finished. Installation of can additional 300 lines in the Singha Durbar Secretariat will also be completed.
"
1412,"Installation of the 300 lines system at Biratnagar will be finished during the first year.
"
1413,"East-West micro Wave: The present telephone system within Nepal extends eastward from Kathmandu through Dhankuta, Jaleshwor and Janakpur to Biratnagar and westward to Plapa.
"
1414,"This line is old and not properly functioning. Hence, this will be replaced by micro -wave system.
"
1415,"This system will be capable of carrying messages continuously through hundreds of chan nels and will not be affected by the monsoon.
"
1416,"Fifty per cent of the total project will be completed during the Third Plan and the remainder will be carried over to the next plan.
"
1417,"The following services will be established under this scheme:
"
1418,"1. The telephone service between the towns in India and Kathmandu will be operated through as 8-channel carrier system.
"
1419,"There will be a direct contact between Kathmandu and Patan through one of these channels.
"
1420,"2. There will be five circuits between Kathmandu and Birgunj.
"
1421,"A direct link from Kathmandu to Hetauda, and Hetauda to Birgunj will be established as separate circuit.
"
1422,"Under this system, direct contact between Hetauda and Bhainse, Hetauda and Amlekhgunj, and Birgunj and Simra will be possible.
"
1423,"Of these five circuits, one circuit will be specifically used to contact Palung-Hetauda vicinity from Kathmandu.
"
1424,"Telegraph System: A Six-channel V.T.T. telegraph system will be established to communicate masses from Kathamdnu to India and various other centers.
"
1425,"A three-circuit telegraph line from Kathmandu will be extended to Birgunj through Bahainse, Hetauda, Amlekhgunj and Simra.
"
1426,"Six English script teleprinter sets will be installed at Kathmandu for receiving news from India. Further, there will be four teleprinter sets for news service between Kathmandu and Birgunj.
"
1427,"These English script teleprinter sets will be replaced by Nepali script teleprinters in the future
"
1428,"Telephone Exchange: In Birgunj, a 300 lines automatic exchange and a trunk exchange services will be established.
"
1429,"There will be four direct lines, and two booking and inquiry lines.
"
1430,"For the trunk call service between Kathmandu and other districts of the country, a trunk exchange service having four enquiries and booking lines will be established.
"
1431,"The international trunk exchange will also be started at Kathmandu.
"
1432,"Public call centers with ten magneto board systems will be established in Palung, Bhainse, Hetauda, Amlekhgunj and Simra.
"
1433,"Education
"
1434,"Education plays an important role in the field of social economic development.
"
1435,"Technical and Adminis trative knowledge required for the creation of a modern society is obtained from an education that is in keeping with the need of the times.
"
1436,"In addition, education is vital for the promotion of the intellectual and physical personality of the people.
"
1437,"An educated peasant, aware of the needs of reform in agriculture, will be enthusiastic to adopt modern methods cultivation.
"
1438,"Significant progress has been achieved in education over the last few years. However, Nepal still lags far behind in this field in comparison with other countries of the world.
"
1439,"It is imperative, therefore, to step up the efforts in educational development in the coming years.
"
1440,"But such efforts should be preceded by a careful consideration of several factors, particularly the storage of financial resources and technical know-how.
"
1441,"In order to attain maximum benefit from the scarce resources, a well coordinated ant comprehensive education programme should be formulated.
"
1442,"Development of education calls for an adequate supply of trained teachers as well as education materials, which will take a long time to be fulfilled.
"
1443,"The number of primary schools can be increased only in proportion to the teachers trained in the normal schools.
"
1444,"Since primary and secondary education programmes have to be developed in a coordinated way, the expansion of primary education will determine the provision to be made for secondary education.
"
1445,"Following the Karachi Plan 1962-63, His Majesty’s Government has adopted the policy of providing primary school facilities to all boys and girls by 1980.
"
1446,"Development of secondary and higher education should be carefully, considered, bearing in mind the expansion of primary education and the growing need for educated manpower. The objectives for education in The Third Plan period are as follows:
"
1447,"3. To raise the standard of teaching in secondary and higher educational institutions.
"
1448,"4. To supply books and other education materials as required by the educational institutions.
"
1449,"5. To make necessary improvements in the work the Education Ministry concerning statistics and programming in order to create a sound base for the formulation of education development programmes in the future.
"
1450,"Education Development Programme
"
1451,"Based on the above policy guidelines and objectives the following programme for education at different levels has been proposed in this plan period.
"
1452,"Primary Education
"
1453,"Progress made during the last few years in primary education is encouraging. By the end of the second Plan, 27 per cent of the children of school going age received some primary education, compared to 0.7 percent in 1949-50 and 15.3 percent in 1961-62.
"
1454,"There is still much to be done to set up a sound system and to raise the standard of education.
"
1455,"At present for example, thee number of fifth year students is less than 10 per cent of the first year students.
"
1456,"It is due partly to the fact that there are 300 one-teacher schools where students cannot pursue their studies further than the 1st and 2nd classes.
"
1457,"Hence over half of the primary school students do not go beyond the first class. An education of this kind is costly and of limited benefits hence a misuse of the country’s scarce resources.
"
1458,"It is therefore necessary that the number of classes be increased in existing schools so that students do not encounter a dead end.
"
1459,"Primary schools must also be extended to more areas. The target under the Third Plan will be to provide education to 40 per cent of the children of school age.
"
1460,"In order to fulfill the demand for teachers in the primary schools, 5,000 teachers will be trained with the extension of the teach training programme. In addition, further training will be given to teachers now saving in 3,000 primaries schools.
"
1461,"Increased assistance will be extended to schools for the construction of new buildings to increase the number of classes.
"
1462,"In this programme, priority will be given to those schools that provide free and compulsory education.
"
1463,"In order to make text -books available for the primary schools, sixteen books will be published and distributed. Management of schools will be decentralized in those districts where it is found appropriate.
"
1464,"Grants given by His Majesty’s Government to the primary schools will be gradually reduced so as to the schools locally self-sufficient.
"
1465,"Secondary Education
"
1466,"In addition, improvement in the quality of secondary education is necessary.
"
1467,"For example, the percentage of students passing the examination given at the end of secondary training and receiving their School Leaving Certificate (S.C.L.) is very low.
"
1468,"Attention will be given to this point during this Plan period.
"
1469,"During the Third Plan, the enrolment of secondary school students will be increased from 40,000 to 68,000 by upgrading 115 primary schools into middle schools and 36 middle schools into high schools.
"
1470,"Under this programme 1,000 secondary school teachers will be trained.
"
1471,"Provision for the required education materials will also be made. Hostel facilities will be provided to the students coming from distant places.
"
1472,"Special studies will be undertaken in different high schools to evaluate the effects of the various steps taken under the education development programme and seminars of supervisors and teachers will be organized. Vocational Education
"
1473,"The aim of the vocational education program is to combine occupational and general knowledge. To achieve this objective, high schools have been converted into multi-purpose schools to provide, in addition to the basic curriculum, vocational training in agriculture, industries etc.
"
1474,"During the Second Plan period, 16 agriculture secondary schools were converted into multi-purpose schools and training has been given in four subjects: agriculture, home science, commerce and secretarial skills.
"
1475,"In addition, construction of a technical institute and a demonstration multi-purpose high school with capacities of 600 and 500 students respectively was begun.
"
1476,"Every year 100 vocational teachers are given 8 weeks’ in -service training.
"
1477,"During the Third Plan period, teaching in the technical institute and the demonstration multi-purpose school will be started. By 1970-71 it is proposed to open both of these educational institutions at full capacity.
"
1478,"A hostel accommodation 250 students for the technical institute and another for 100 students at the demonstration school will be constructed.
"
1479,"In the present 16 multi-purpose schools, the number of vocational classes will be increased from 120 to 320 and thus 5,000 students will receive multi-purpose education.
"
1480,"Ten more high schools will be converted into multi-purpose school to provide vocational training for another 2,500 students.
"
1481,"At the zonal level three vocational school buildings and hostels will be constructed.
"
1482,"More than 60 workshops will be arranged over the country and guidance and supervision will be given the multi-purpose and vocational schools.
"
1483,"Adult Education
"
1484,"Under the adult education programme initiated in 1956-57 it is established that about 100,000 adults were made literate by 1965-66.
"
1485,"During this Plan period an additional 100,000 adults will be made literature.
"
1486,"Moreover, a regular evaluation of this adult education programme will be made and contact maintained with the trained adults in order to keep the students in touch with what they have learned.
"
1487,"Education Materials Significant progress has been made in the production and distribution of education materials as a result of steps taken in accordance with the recommendation made by the National Education Planning commission in 1954-55.
"
1488,"It is evident however that education materials required in the future will be grown rapidly as the number of students increases and the quality of education improves.
"
1489,"Therefore, the programme for the production of education materials will be expanded according to need: 75 new books will be prepared and published— some for use by students as texts and others by teachers by as reference.
"
1490,"In addition to the three quarterly magazines now being published. Two other quarterlies will be started.
"
1491,"Records, charts, pictures and other teaching materials in Nepali and English will be made available in increased quantities.
"
1492,"Higher Education There has been rapid growth of higher education since 1954-55, but little improvement has been made in the organization and management of colleges.
"
1493,"At present these are 29 Arts and Science Colleges in 11 of the 14 zones. Fourteen of these colleges are centered in the Bagamti zone alone.
"
1494,"In 18 colleges, however, number of students is less than 100.
"
1495,"Only five colleges have more than 300 students.
"
1496,"The curriculum is very weak in many instances. It is evident from these facts that a special effort should be made to raise the standard education and that improvement in the organization of the colleges and in the curriculum must receive first attention.
"
1497,"In this Plan the higher education programme has been divided into four parts: (1) Collage improvement,(2) Secondary school teacher training, (3) Primary school teacher and (4) Tribhuwan University.
"
1498,"College Improvement Programme Under this programme, honors classes will be organized in some subjects at Tri-Chandra College and necessary facilities will be made available for this purpose.
"
1499,"The library of the Tri-Chandra College will be expended.
"
1500,"An examination hall will also be constructed.
"
1501,"In addition, other colleges will be given assistance for building construction.
"
1502,"Secondary School Teachers’ Training
"
1503,"At present about 2,200 teachers are teaching in the secondary schools, of which adequately trained teachers’ number only 100. This is mainly because only a few of the persons trained in the College of Education work as teachers after graduation.
"
1504,"It is, therefore, necessary to make provision for the employment of the trained persons as teachers along with an increase in the capacity of the teacher-training institutions. In this Plan period, new teacher training collages will be set up by providing one year and two year B. Ed.
"
1505,"Course. In addition, a Master of Education degree programme will be initiated at Tribhuwan University.
"
1506,"High classes will be held for teachers already on the job. Great stress will be laid on teaching methods in workshops to be conducted twice every year.
"
1507,"Necessary steps will be taken to make the teaching profession attractive for the trained persons. Primary School Teacher Training
"
1508,"The main objective of the primary school teachers training programme is to train teachers for the primary schools, and to bring about uniformity in t he teaching methods and curriculum of the primary schools.
"
1509,"Under this programme 4,500 teachers have been trained since 1954-55 in seven normal schools now functioning in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Dharan, Illam, Pokhara, Palpa and Salyan.
"
1510,"During the Third Plan Period, a new normal school will be established at Dandeldhura and hostels will be built at Birgunj, Dharan, Illam and Palpa.
"
1511,"During the vacation period normal school workshops will be organized where the curriculum will be revised and revised as necessary.
"
1512,"Tribhuwan University
"
1513,"Under the building construction programme as envisaged in the Second Plan, a chemistry department building, a student hostel, staff quarters and a memorial hall have been completed.
"
1514,"The College of Education buildings and a library are under construction.
"
1515,"Another objective in the Second Plan was to increase the number of Nepalese lectures in the University.
"
1516,"Satisfactory progress has been made in this field as well.
"
1517,"During the current Plan period, expansion will be made in the facilities of the Arts, Science and Commerce collages.
"
1518,"In particular, special effort will be made to initiate higher studies in Chemistry, Biology, Botany and Physics.
"
1519,"As mentioned above, Master of Education classes will also be started.
"
1520,"Construction of buildings for the Physics Department and two hostels will be completed soon in order to open classes for the M. S. degree in Chemistry, Physics, Biology and Botany.
"
1521,"By the end of the Plan period, construction of an Arts College building, staff quarters and office buildings will be completed. In addition necessary provision will be made for a gymnasium, a playground, water, electricity and roads on the campus.
"
1522,"The present educational system and the curriculum will be reviewed and necessary revisions will be made.
"
1523,"CHAPTER XXIII
"
1524,"Health As in other fields, Nepal lags far behind in health services.
"
1525,"A number of development projects have been undertaken during the First and Second Plan periods, but a well-organized health service is still lacking.
"
1526,"A large number of people still fall victim cholera, small-pox, tuberculosis and malaria.
"
1527,"As a result, the average life expectancy of a Nepalese is 32 years, whereas in India, Pakistan and Japan it is 45, 45 and 70 respectively.
"
1528,"The annual death rate is Nepal 21 per thousand and infant mortality is 244 per thousand.
"
1529,"In order to increase the average life expectancy of the people, improve their health and enlist their active participation in development, malaria must be eradicated from the area where 4,500,000 people live and covering 40160.0 kilometers. The country must be freed from the menace of tuberculosis, small-pox, leprosy and other diseases.
"
1530,"Programme in the Previous Plans
"
1531,"During the First Plan period, hospitals with capacity totaling 149 beds were constructed and 79 health centres established. In the second Plan three more hospitals and 8 health centres were added, bringing the total number of hospital beds to 1,156.
"
1532,"Malaria eradication work has been completed in the Central Zone and it is under way in the Eastern Zone.
"
1533,"In Kathmandu 450,000 people have been inoculated against small-pox and a survey of leprosy has been completed.
"
1534,"Under the present circumstances, it will inevitably take sometime to development a satisfactory programme in the health services of the country.
"
1535,"But training these personnel takes time.
"
1536,"Hence the limited financial resources of the country have to be used in the best possible way.
"
1537,"Keeping in view the short as well as the long term need for health service, the health services programme of this Plan is divided into three parts: (1) preventive measures, (2) hospital services and (3) training.
"
1538,"(1) Preventive Measures
"
1539,"Great emphasis is given to preventive measures. Thee programme for the Third Plan will be as follows:
"
1540,"Malaria Eradication: In the central zonal, D.D.T Spraying work has been in progress since 1960, and the survey work will be continued.
"
1541,"In fiscal 1065-66, survey work will be completed; in 1966-67, under the consolidation phase, malaria insects will be widely investigated. If all goes well, in the final year of the Third Plan, the maintenance phase will be started in the central zone.
"
1542,"In the eastern zone D.D.T. spraying work will be continued up to the fourth year of the Third Plan and the consolidation phase will be initiated in the final year.
"
1543,"In the western zone, D.D.T. will be sprayed from the first year of the Plan and survey work will started in selected areas beginning in the third year. In some areas consolidation phase will be entered in the final year.
"
1544,"The Consolidation phase in this zone well not be completed, however, until the middle of the fourth plan.
"
1545,"Eradication of Small-Pox: Small-pox eradication work on a pilot project basis was initiated in the country in 1962-63 with the help of the World Health Organization (W.H.O).
"
1546,"In the last two years it will be extended to Morang and Parsa districts.
"
1547,"Leprosy Control and Survey: This pilot project was started in Kathmandu in 1962-63 in order to identify the victims of leprosy, to treat them and to set up leprosy control centres.
"
1548,"At present, this work is carried out at Pachali Clinic, Khokana Leprosarium and four other clinics.
"
1549,"Skin and Venereal Disease Control: As the present Pachali Clinic for skin and venereal disease in not up-to-date, a new building will be constructed, and in Bir Hospital, a dermatological ward of 10 beds will be opened to treat persons suffering from these diseases.
"
1550,"Details of the programme are as follows: Hospitals: In order to raise the level of health services the Department of Health will convert 58 existing hospitals and the Hetauda health centre into 25-bed hospitals.
"
1551,"Seven more district hospitals and 11 health centres will be converted into 15-beds hospitals. Heath Centres: During the plan, 32 health centers will be provided with doctors and necessary equipment.
"
1552,"These health centres will be divided into tow groups. Each group will consist of 16 health centres.
"
1553,"Both of these groups will be provided with doctors except that the first group will also have lady doctors.
"
1554,"The second group will have assistance nurse midwives instead of lady doctors.
"
1555,"Health Posts: During the Plan period 103 health posts will be established.
"
1556,"These will be under the control of the district health organization with 3 to 5 health posts in each district where they are established.
"
1557,"Each health post will have 3 to 6 mobile teams to cover assigned area of the district.
"
1558,"Zonal Offices: During this Plan period, 8 new zonal offices will be established, which will be helpful in the supervision of local health units.
"
1559,"There will be hospitals with 50 or 25 beds under these zonal offices.
"
1560,"Training Programme
"
1561,"In order to implement successfully the health services programme by making available trained personnel the following training programme have been incorporated in this Plan:
"
1562,"Nurse Training: Under this programme the construction of a Nurses’ Training School in the Bir Hospital compound will be completed.
"
1563,"Hostel facilities will be provided to the nurse trainees and the annual intake of trainees will be increased from 30 to 40.
"
1564,"Auxiliary Health Workers Training: This Plan aims art training 60 auxiliary health workers every year, for which adequate provision of buildings and hostel facilities will be made.
"
1565,"In order to make the programme effective, training will also be given to persons working in the malaria eradication department and they will be reassigned.
"
1566,"The will become possible as the malaria programme nears the maintenance phase.
"
1567,"Training of Assistant Nurses and Midwives: As the Bharatpur centre alone cannot meet the country’s demand for assistant nurses and midwives, new training centre will be opened in the Plan period at Birtnagar and Nepalgunj.
"
1568,"Forty additional assistant nurses and midwives will be trained in these centres every year. Medical College: at present, about fifteen persons are sent abroad for medical training each year.
"
1569,"At present, there are only two hundred doctors in Nepal. The ratio between doctors and population is 1 to 50,000.
"
1570,"We have to train at least 100 doctors every year for the next several years in order to lower the ratio to 10,000.
"
1571,"To provide a part of this training, a medical college will be established to start functioning within the Plan period.
"
1572,"Because a medical college must have adequate associated hospital facilities, the present strength of the hospitals in Kathmandu will be increased to five hundred beds. Miscellaneous
"
1573,"Family Planning: It is felt that the population of Nepal will grow at a faster rate as assured of the public health measures. Thus it will not be possible to increase the standard of living of the people unless the birth rate is checked.
"
1574,"In this Plan period, four family planning clinics, two in Kathmandu and one each in Patan and Bhaktapur, will start functioning under the family planning branch of the Directorate of Health Services.
"
1575,"Family planning education will be conducted and family planning devices distributed on a limited scale.
"
1576,"If the programme proves successful, it will be extended to other areas.
"
1577,"This laboratory will be concerned with pathological epidemiological, bacteriological and infectious diseases, and it will analyze water and food materials.
"
1578,"Ayurvedic System: As regards Ayurved, the present Ayurved College and Ayurved Hospital of Kathmandu will be expanded so as to make available more training facilities.
"
1579,"The Ayurvedic dispensary will also be reorganized and renovated. There will improved reorganized coordination between the hospital and the college.
"
1580,"Drinking Water And Sewage
"
1581,"Two things are necessary to create a healthy physical environment: (a) a supply of pure water in adequate quantity and (b) a sanitary sewage disposal system.
"
1582,"It is necessary, therefore, to give emphasis to these works and a master plan for the supply of drinking water should be formulated from a long-term viewpoint.
"
1583,"Such a master plan for the Kathmandu Valley is under preparation by joint efforts of His Majesty’s Government and then World health Organization.
"
1584,"Third Plan
"
1585,"Drinking Water: During the Third Plan period drinking water supply system will be developed in all of the important urban areas.
"
1586,"Priority will be given to the areas without easy access to drinking water.
"
1587,"The schemes incorporated in this Plan are as follows:
"
1588,"Kathmandu: At present 8,182,800 litres of water per day are supplied to Kathmandu from the balaju and
"
1589,"Maharajgunj reservoirs for a population ot 180,000. The distribution system is in poor condition.
"
1590,"A scheme to increase the water supply by 32,000,000 gallons per day is under way. This scheme will be completed in the First year of the plan period, and will meet the requirements for the coming ten years.
"
1591,"Fifty years from now, it is estimated that 9,000,000 gallons of water per day will be required.
"
1592,"It appears from existing hydrological data those 15,000,000 gallons of water per day can be supplied from the Bagamti, Sialmati and Nagmati rivers. A master plan will therefore be framed to develop this long-term scheme.
"
1593,"Lalitpur: Lalitpur with a population of 49,000 is the second largest town of Nepal.
"
1594,"Only 400,000 gallons of drinking water per day are presently available against a need of 1,000,000 gallons per day.
"
1595,"A scheme to supply 3,500,000 gallons of drinking water per day will be implemented during this plan
"
1596,"Bhaktapur: Bhaktapur, with 34,400 populations, is the third largest town on Nepal.
"
1597,"This present supply of drinking water is 120,000 gallons per day.
"
1598,"During this Plan period 1,140,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Bhaktpur.
"
1599,"Birgunj: Birgunj has a population of 15,000.
"
1600,"During the second Plan construction work was started on a scheme too supply 400,000 gallon per day. Construction will be completed in the near future.
"
1601,"Pokhara: During the Second Plan a water supply scheme was initiated in Pokhara which has a population of 30,000.
"
1602,"When completed this project will supply 600,000 gallons per day.
"
1603,"Kirtipur: At present 30,000 gallons of water per day are supplied to Kirtipur with a population of 8,000.
"
1604,"With the completion of the proposed scheme in Latipur, 400,000 gallons of water per day will be supplied to kirtupur, Panga and the Tribhuwan University Campus. Thimi: Water supply at Thimi, Bodey, and Nagadesh is from tube-wells.
"
1605,"A new scheme has become necessary as there is excess iron content in the tube-well water.
"
1606,"Rajbiraj: no water supply scheme has been provided for Rajbiraj with a population of 12,000.
"
1607,"The main sources of drinking water are the rivers and some hand pumps.
"
1608,"During this plan period 300,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Rajbiraj by a project now under preparation.
"
1609,"Nepalgun: Population is increasing rapidly in Nepalgunj which is inhabited now by 10,000 people.
"
1610,"The present water supply is 5,000 gallons per day.
"
1611,"A scheme to supply 28,000 gallons per day is underway and will be completed during this Plan period.
"
1612,"Janakpurt: Janakpur with a population of 8,000 is still dependent for its water supply on a distant river and a few hand pumps.
"
1613,"A scheme to supply 360,000 gallons per day will be completed during this Plan period.
"
1614,"Bhairawa: At present Bairhawa with a population of 7,500 depends for its water supply on a river and some hand pumps. A scheme to supply 150,000 gallons per day is underway and will be completed soon.
"
1615,"Bhadrapur: Bhadrapur with a population of 6,000 is devoid of a modern water supply scheme.
"
1616,"It has to depend on river water. Investigation is underway in order to provide 140,000 gallons of water per day.
"
1617,"Construction work will be completed during this Plan Period.
"
1618,"Dhangdi: During this Plan 150,000 gallons per day will be supplied to Dhangadi with a population of 6,400, which is in acute shortage of drinking water.
"
1619,"Banepa: The existing water supply system which was set up 25 years ago will be improved in order to make available an additional 40,00 gallons per day.
"
1620,"Dang: Hand pumps are the only source of drinking water for 4,200 inhabitants of Dang.
"
1621,"A scheme will be implemented to supply 35,000 gallons per day.
"
1622,"Koilabas: During this Plan period a scheme will be implemented to supply 75,000 gallons of drinking water per day in order to meet the present requirement.
"
1623,"Terai and Hill areas: It is essential to make provision o\for drinking water in some villages to Terai and the hills which are urgently in need of it.
"
1624,"Under this scheme 35,000 gallons per day will be made available in different place to be selected later.
"
1625,"Sewage Construction: at present, the only sewage system in Nepal of any consequence exists in some areas of Kathmandu.
"
1626,"In the absence of a modern sewage system, disease epidemics frequently occur. It is therefore essential to develop a sanitary sewage along with the provision of drinking water.
"
1627,"With the assistance of the World Health Organization, preliminary work has been started to formulate a master plan (Nepal. 14) for the provision of drinking water and a sewage system for the Kathmandu Valley.
"
1628,"A detailed survey is necessary for the construction of a sewage system in Kathmandu as the next step. This program should be coordinated with the proposed master plan for the Kathmandu Valley.
"
1629,"During this Plan period, the survey will be completed and construction sta rted.
"
1630,"Experimental Village Sanitation Programme: This programme consists of both a water supply and a sewage disposal system.
"
1631,"It will be started on an experimental basis in the three villages of Lalitpur, with the assistance of UNICEF.
"
1632,"Under this programme a work shop will be established for the maintenance of the water supply system and necessary materials will be made available for the implementation of the schemes.
"
1633,"Drinking Water Supply: In order to collect necessary information for the formulation of water supply schemes, surveys will be undertaken; this will be linked with the water resources discussed elsewhere. CHAPTER XXV
"
1634,"Housing Programs
"
1635,"At various cities in Nepal the problem of housing has become a severe one.
"
1636,"Particularly in Kathmandu and Patan population is increasing of the rate of 2.2 per cent due to the mobility of people and the natural increase of population.
"
1637,"The present population of Kathmandu and Patan is 171,000 whereas the number of houses at these two places is only 22,534.
"
1638,"On the basis of one house required for one five-member family unit 34,200 houses are needed in Kathmandu and Patan alone, which means that an additional 11,686 houses are needed.
"
1639,"In the first two plans, there was no provision for housing.
"
1640,"Keeping in view the limited resources available and the preliminary nature of the work, the housing program will be launched on a limited scale during the Third Plan.
"
1641,"Since 1950, a keen interest has been shown towards the construction of houses in the private sector.
"
1642,"These new houses however, are designed especially for the purpose of renting to foreigners and the requirements of the common people have not been met.
"
1643,"His Majesty’s Government has been advancing three years’ salary to the civil servants for the const ruction of houses as a further inducement; however, this amount is quite inadequate to cover construction costs, especially for middle class civil servants.
"
1644,"Target of the Third Plan Housing
"
1645,"His Majesty’s Government will provide necessary incentives to the private sector in order to construct 400 new houses in Kathmandu, particularly for the use of the middle and low income groups.
"
1646,"In addition, 51.28 hectares of new plots of land will be acquired during the plan period. Utilities such as water, electricity, schools, roads etc., will be arranged on this land and plots will be sold to persons interested in constructing houses.
"
1647,"It necessary, the land will also be sold on an installment basis.
"
1648,"Town Planning
"
1649,"In order to develop the city areas in Kathmandu Valley, a master plan of Kathmandu and Patan is under preparation. Master plan for neighboring cities will also be prepared during the plan period.
"
1650,"On the basis of such plans, steps will be undertaken to improve the city area of the Kathamndu Valley.
"
1651,"Building Construction
"
1652,"Steps will be taken to preserve Nepal’s cultural heritages in the form of music, dance, etc.
"
1653,"In the field of industrial data, a list of existing industries has been prepared and published.
"
1654,"In 1965, the collection of industrial statistics will be started.
"
1655,"The detailed report will be published in 1965.
"
1656,"With an aim of collecting data regarding industrial output and other related information in Nepal, an Industrial Survey will be conducted every year.
"
1657,"This survey will also encompass small industries scattered throughout the country.
"
1658,"Domestic Trade
"
1659,"Since the present knowledge about domestic trade is very limited, a survey will be made to collect necessary data regarding important trade centres.
"
1660,"Vital Statistics
"
1661,"The collection of Vital Statistics will be started first in the major cities. Within the plan period, all cities in Nepal will be included.
"
1662,"Later, this activity will be extended gradually to the whole country.
"
1663,"Price Statistics
"
1664,"The collection of price data and the calculation of price indexes for both the Terai and Kathmandu regions will be continued.
"
1665,"More commodities and place will be covered to make it more comprehensive.
"
1666,"Family Budget Survey
"
1667,"The present family budget survey of certain area in Kathmandu will be gradually extended to cover Bhaktapur, Lalitput and some cities of the Terai as well.
"
1668,"National Income Preliminary estimates of national income, prepared first for 1961-62, have also been prepared for 1954-65.
"
1669,"During the plan period further improvements will be made in these estimates and additional data included on expenditures, savings and capital accumulation.
"
1670,"Miscellaneous
"
1671,"Statistics on foreign trade, aviation, railways, road transport and education will also be colle cted systematically and published.
"
1672,"Administration of the Central Buresu will be reformed and improved.
"
1673,"Modern equipment will be arranged to process the survey result quickly and efficiently. A new building will be provided to house staff and equipment.
"
1674,"Chapter XXVIII
"
1675,"Hydrological Survey In order to develop irrigation, drinking water and hydro-electric power, hydrological data are very essential.
"
1676,"Collection of hydrological data for different rivers and streams was begun during the Second.
"
1677,"A Hydrological Survey Department was set-up to collect this information and to develop forecasting statistics.
"
1678,"Necessary data with regard to the volume of water flow in various major and small rivers of Nepal will be made available form these stations.
"
1679,"Nothing has been done in this direction so far. During the plan period, surveys will be made to determine the possibility of using ground water in the Kathmandu Valley and Terai Region.
"
1680,"Nineteen ground water sampling stations and 40 sediment sampling stations will also be established.
"
1681,"Forecasting Station
"
1682,"Seventy stations will be established to collect rainfall, temperature and other weather data.
"
1683,"During the Plan period, weather forecasting will be introduced.
"
1684,"Other
"
1685,"Four zonal level offices will be set up to supervise workers in various areas.
"
1686,"One central laboratory will be established to analyze the quality an the volume of water.
"
1687,"Administrative Reform
"
1688,"The speed of economic development does not only on capital and labour, but also upon Government administrative capacity.
"
1689,"Since His Majesty’s Government must bear a major responsibility for achieving rapid economic development of the nation, necessary improvements in the organization and operation of all aspects of government must be implemented.
"
1690,"Administrative improvement was stressed in the Second Plan and, as a result, considerable progress was made.
"
1691,"Training facilities have been made available at several levels of government service.
"
1692,"New methods and techniques of administration were introduced. Better performance, particularly by staff at the lower levels, has been achieved.
"
1693,"Many accountants serving in all ministries and departments were trained under the Accountant Training Programme in order to maintain accounts are accordance with up-to-date procedures.
"
1694,"Now procedures in budgeting and fund releases were helpful in effective execution of developmental activities.
"
1695,"In spite of these achievements, further changes in the administrative system are necessary for the successful implementation of the Third Plan and of subsequent plans.
"
1696,"In view of the increasing volume of work in ministries and departments, the creation of new section and sub-sections and the appointment of new staff continuous improvement in administrative regulations and organization s administrative regulations and organization are required.
"
1697,"As such, the study of departmental organization and recommendations for improvement various public sector industries must also be properly managed and guidance provided the private sector.
"
1698,"The latter activities differ from the general activities of Government administrative: Thus study and analysis are necessary.
"
1699,"In order to meet these diverse requirements, the following steps will be taken:
"
1700,"Reform is General Administrative
"
1701,"In the third Plan, the goal will be to create and effective and efficient administrative structure in the entire government.
"
1702,"To achieve this target, heavy emphasis will be given to personnel improvement and revision of administrative policies and procedures.
"
1703,"Specifically, the following steps will be taken:
"
1704,"Pre-Service Training
"
1705,"A pre-service training programme will be conducted for all the new employees of His Majesty’s Government, especially the inexperienced employees’ recruited upon completion of a degree programme with one of the educational institutions.
"
1706,"In-Service Training
"
1707,"Under this training programme, government servants will be made aware of the importance of modern administration, administration relating to manpower, administrative procedures, budget, statistics, planning, etc.
"
1708,"The training standard will be fixed according to the grade, ministry or department and the work of the government servants. The programme will be conducted through the medium of lectures, debates and educational films.
"
1709,"Experience in practical application of knowledge will also be stressed. The training activities will take place in the present administrative training centre.
"
1710,"Hence, during the Plan period, consideration will be given to thee creation of a separate unit to strengthen and reorganize matters relating to personnel management.
"
1711,"With the expansion of government activities, daily administrative procedures become more cumbersome.
"
1712,"In order to make the procedures simple and yet effective, corresponding methods and filing systems will be studied and improved as required.special effort will be made to avoid unnecessary paper work, and to define staff responsibility and authority in a manner consistent with the functions of various administrative units .
"
1713,"Maintenance of Equipment
"
1714,"As administrative procedures are modernized, use of office machines is also increasing.
"
1715,"Thus a central unit will be created for maintenance and repair as well as to provide spare for the equipment. Accountant Training
"
1716,"The existing Accountants Training Programme will be expanded. Arrangements will be made for training accountants in variousd districts.
"
1717,"The current training of clerical staff will be further expanded. Advisory Services
"
1718,"One of the major factors in administrative organization at present is an advisory staff to assist high level officials in the various ministries.
"
1719,"Such units could be effectively used in studying and providing recommendation on training, reform in administration, personnel management, data collection and related subjects.
"
1720,"Therefore, efforts will be made during the plan period to provide an advisory staff to each ministry.
"
1721,"Administrative Reform in the Industrial Sector
"
1722,"Requisites for and efficient industrial administrator are different from the requirement for a general administrator.
"
1723,"The smooth functioning of industries requires, in addition to general administrative knowledge, the knowledge of marketing, account ting, labour and related factors.
"
1724,"Such knowledge of is every limited in the industries of Nepal which were in their initial stages of development.
"
1725,"Nance, special attention will be given to this matter during the Plan period.
"
1726,"In meeting short term requirements, shorts period training will be provide within the country, and industrial inspection tours in neighboring countries will be arranged so that industries in both the public and private sector will be run efficiently.
"
1727,"For the long term, more persons will be given specialized training. These people will be sent abroad for higher educational training.
"
1728,"Customs and Taxation Administration
"
1729,"In order to adequately finance developmental activities, mere passing of various taxation laws will not be sufficient; rather the government will have to increase its sources of income.
"
1730,"Taxes must be assessed on a scientific basis and condition created of their regular collection.
"
1731,"Therefore, steps will be taken during the Plan period to improve the customs and taxation procedures of His Majesty’s Government.
"
1732,"Since training is the given necessary training.
"
1733,"Office builds will be provided in districts where there are no customs and taxation offices art present .
"
1734,"Sports
"
1735,"As compared to other developing countries, Nepal is far behind in the field of sports also.
"
1736,"After the political change of 1950 the Nepalese have shown their interest in sports by organizing various national sports organizations and national competitions.
"
1737,"Moreover, Nepalese sportsmen have started taking part in international competition. Nepal participated for the first time in the 1964 world Olympic Games held in Tokyo, In spite of these efforts, significant progress has not yet been achieved.
"
1738,"It would not be unfair to say that in recent years the general standard of sports in Nepal has been rather discouraging.
"
1739,"One of the main reason for the current state of sports is the black of adequate encouragement provided by the government in this filed. Some steps were proposed to develop the sports during this plan.
"
1740,"But these steps were not implemented. Therefore, during this Plan period, every effort will be made to attract the interest of the people in the field of sports.
"
1741,"To achieve this goal, the National Council of Health and sports will be activised.
"
1742,"In addition, programmes programmes on sports and physical education under the direction of the Education Ministry will be launched to popularize sports at the School and college level.
"
1743,"Construction of one stadium, one auditorium and one swimming pool, which were already planned in the Second Plan, will be undertaken during this Plan period.
"
1744,"In implementing any plan, very efforts must be made to anticipate difficulties and to take steps to remove them.
"
1745,"Annual Plans and the Development Process
"
1746,"Implementation of the Five year necessarily takes places on a periodic basis through annual budgeting. Annual programmes must be submitted and incorporated in the development budget.
"
1747,"In the submission, quarterly work programmes must be included.
"
1748,"Because annual budgets reflect the financial resources available at the time of preparation, they cannot be fully implementation
"
1749,"Annual plans must further take into account manpower, materials and other resources available.
"
1750,"Targets for each yea, moreover, should be specified within the framework of the Five Year, Plan targets.
"
1751,"Coordination if interrelated plans must be achieved in an annual basis as well.
"
1752,"Project Preparation
"
1753,"The successful formulation and implementation of any development plan depends heavily upon careful study and preparation of project and programme proposals. Unless projects are based upon a thorough study of all of the factors involved and prepared with a realistic time perspective, their implementation will run into difficulties and delays which will adversely affect development performance.
"
1754,"Further-more, projects in such areas as irrigation and power must be selected from among a variety of alternative possibilities.
"
1755,"Unless careful analysis takes place, the projects included in the plan may not be the ones which would provide maximum to the nation.
"
1756,"Coordination at the local level
"
1757,"His majesty’s Government has adopted a decentralization policy which should make it possible to effectively coordinate activities at the local levels.
"
1758,"Progress Reports
"
1759,"An effective reporting system is necessary to keep abreast of the progress of development activities.
"
1760,"The frequency of such reports will depend on the kind of activity involved.
"
1761,"Reports covering construction projects should be submitted more fequantly than, for example report on teacher training operations.
"
1762,"As bottlenecks and difficulties arise and are reported necessary corrective action can be taken.
"
1763,"Periodic inspections of projects are also necessary.
"
1764,"In order to assure prompt corrective action when and where difficulties arise, review of many projects can be undertaken at the zonal level.
"
1765,"A few zonal offices were established for this purpose in the Second Plan; facilities will be extended to all fo urteen zones in the Third Plan.
"
1766,"CHAPTER XXXII
"
1767,"Decentralization
"
1768,"The importance of the panchayat system in securing mass support for national and local development programmes and the need for decentralization to further generate support have already been mentioned.
"
1769,"In order to generate greater public support, to coordinate loc level activities and to effectively implement plans, more responsibility needs to be given the 3,600 village, 75 district and 14 zonal panchayats.
"
1770,"During the Plan period, with the implementation of decentralization, greater authority will be given the local and district panchayat.
"
1771,"The development of health, education, agriculture, roads and similar functions at the local level will be shifted gradually to the district panchayats. The district will, in turn, delegate many of these functions to the village panchayats.
"
1772,"In order to achieve the objectives of decentralization, distr5ict administration will be reorganized and staff upgraded and given the necessary training.
"
1773,"In order to ensure the successful implementation of decentralization, the steps must be carefully planned and actual achievements kept under continuous review.
"
1774,"The decentra lization progrmme will therefore be undertaken in three phases.
"
1775,"Greater power will be given the districts panachayats as the programme advances through the three phases.
"
1776,"These have been identified as preliminary transitional and permanent.
"
1777,"Preliminary Phase
"
1778,"The purpose of the preliminary phase is to establish the administrative and organizational relationships necessary at the district level. The present Dichotomy between 75 separately demarcated panchayat districts and 35 administrative districts will be eliminated.
"
1779,"The present situation is responsible for considerable confusion and overlapping responsibilities.
"
1780,"In its place, 75 district administrative officers will be appointed, one for each panchayat district.
"
1781,"This officer will take over the responsibilities presently given to district governors and Panachayat development officer. The district officer will be responsible to the central government through the zonal administration.
"
1782,"Transitional Phase
"
1783,"In the transitional phase various programmes presently operated from the centre will be transferred to the district pancahayats.
"
1784,"In addition, all central department personnel operating at the district level will be taken into the administrative and technical staff of the district panchayats.
"
1785,"The central department will work through the district officers rather than directly as in the past.
"
1786,"Personnel required for the third phase will be hired and given training in the Second phase. Permanent Phase
"
1787,"Under the third phase, effective district administrative structure will be established and staffed with well- trained personnel. All district level activities except the maintenance of law and order will be under district panchayat authority.
"
1788,"Under this phase, local development within the guidelines set by the national government will be the responsibility of the district and village panchayats.
"
1789,"The following will be undertaken lat the village panchayat level:
"
1790,"1. Cadastral survey and maintenance of records on land ownership, tenancy, etc.
"
1791,"2. Provision of production credit to tillers, marketing of agricultural products through the establishment of multipurpose cooperative societies
"
1792,"3. Provision of agricultural extension services, in order to improve agricultural practices and increase output.
"
1793,"4. Land revenue collection, following the abolition of the zamindar system.
"
1794,"5. Operation and expansion of primary education.
"
1795,"7. Construction and maintenance of minor irrigation works
"
1796,"Because of the costs and trained manpower required, all villages cannot be covered by permanent decentralization during the Third Plan.
"
1797,"In the first year, the permanent phase will be implemented in a few village pancahayats in selected districts and gradually expanded in coverage over time. The activities will be handled by the administrative staff of the village pancahayats and the cooperative societies.
"
1798,"The district level staff will provide technical support and guidance. Those decentralized activities which cannot be effectively decentralized further to the village level will be handled by the district organization.
"
1799,"Examples are land administration, agricultural industry development. Moreover, the preparation of the annual and periodic Plans for the district will be done art the district panchayat level, which formulating such plans, the district panchayat will take into account of activities of the village panachayats.
"
1800,"Implementing different phases of decentralization It is desirable to execute the different phases of decentralization in a planned way.
"
1801,"The implementation of decentralization needs sufficient economic resources, training and supervision, hence it should be extended gradually. Actually the programme of permanent phase will be implemented in one district.
"
1802,"It will then be possible to expand this to other districts on the basis of experience gained. The different stages of decentralization will be executed in the Plan period as given below.
"
1803,"The district officer will be administratively responsible.
"
1804,"An agricultural officer, a land officer, a public services officer, and a non-farm development officer will assist him in this work.
"
1805,"Zonal Level Organizaiton The central government staff will operate from both the central and zonal levels.
"
1806,"At lower levels, departmental contracts will be with the district panchayats and not directly with the professional personnel art the district and village levels.
"
1807,"Under the decentralization programme, the zonal commissioners will have authority for the following:
"
1808,"1. Maintenance of law and order within the zone.
"
1809,"2. Coordinated of activities of the various central departments.
"
1810,"3. Supervising the work of the chief District officers as it relates to His Majesty’s government and providing necessary guidance.
"
1811,"4. Implementation of the decentralization programme within the zone. CHAPTER XXXIII
"
1812,"Construciton Materials, Labour and Transport
"
1813,"No large group of workers as yet treats construction work as permanent employment.
"
1814,"By 1970, total production capacity in Nepal is expected to rise to 3000 cubic feet per year.
"
1815,"Therefore, 6,500,000 cubic feet estimated requirement can be easily met.
"
1816,"Brick production presently is wholly on a village industry basis.
"
1817,"Data on brick production capacity are not available.
"
1818,"Strong steps must be taken to expand brick production to meet the requirement.
"
1819,"A brick and tile factory will be established in Kathmandu with as annual capacity of 30 million bricks and 2.5 million tiles.
"
1820,"Aside form these construction materials, lime, glass and other components are also required.
"
1821,"Heavy equipment requirement will be estimated and steps taken to ensure an adequate supply.
"
1822,"Transportation It is essential to provide transport in order to have materials available for the smoother execution of development activities in the public and private sectors.
"
1823,"Among these are the East- West Highway, the Sonaul-Pokhara Road, the Trisuli Hydel Project the Chatra Cannel and the Kathmandu – Kodari Road.
"
1824,"India, the USSR, China, the United States and other nation will be providing a part of their assistance in this fashion.
"
1825,"The estimated materials requirements for the Third Plan for cement, iron, corrugate sheets and timber are 5,70,000 tons, 100,000 bundles and 6,600,000 cubic feet respectively.
"
1826,"The material requirements discussed above do not include the quantities to be importee into Nepal directly by the aid-giving nations for use of projects with which they are associated.
"
1827,"In the past Plans, many targets could not be achieved because of transportation bottleneck. Even to-day, scheduled arrival of materials as regard is major problem.
"
1828,"The volume of goods which must be transported into Nepal and to points with in Nepal will increase during the Third Plan.
"
1829,"This reflects not only the increase in the volume of construction materials which will be needed but also the movement of food grains and the increased consumers’ goods which will be purchased as income levels rise.
"
1830,"Most of the major development projects are located in the Terai. North India rail and truck facilities will be used to deliver these goods to the border.
"
1831,"In the hill areas where roads are still not developed will be utilized. One possible sources of delay is the clearance of goods for Nepal through Calcutta ports.
"
1832,"In order to expedite clearance, a clearing and forwarding section will be created within the National Transport Corporation. This corporation will work on behalf of the various projects and help to clear the foods from Calcutta port.
"
1833,"Even in kathmandu Valley, which has good transport connection with India, there were storages of supplies during the Second Plan because of transport limitations. In 1965-66, an average of 700 tons of goods per day is expected to move into Kathmandu.
"
1834,"This is expected to rise to 1,000 tons per day by 1970. This total includes all goods, not just construction materials.
"
1835,"The elimination of transport bottlenecks is essential not only to ensure a smooth flow a\of material to development projects but also to help stabilize market price in the Valley.
"
1836,"The condition of the Raxaul-Amlekhgunj railway is very critical.
"
1837,"It can no longer be depended upon as a reliable means of transport but should be used to the maximum extent possible. The Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway started operation in April. 1964 and has been working only one shift carrying an average of 200 tons per day.
"
1838,"In the first year of the Third Plan, the ropeway operations will be expanded to three shifts (24 hours) with a capacity of 600 tons daily.
"
1839,"For, this, the job training programme has been under way and will be completed in the First year of the Third Plan.
"
1840,"The Nepal Transport Corporation will utilize the Raxaul-Amlikhgunj railway, 300 trucks and the ropeway to transport 1000 tons of goods per day from Birgunj to Kathmandu. The transport facilities will expand over the Plan period.
"
1841,"To ensure their maximum use and to provide facilities throughout the country, a transport Organization was established.
"
1842,"It will help to achieve the targets set forth in the plan.
"
1843,"The transport organizations activities will coordinate with other organizations dealing with transport such as RNAC and the National Transport Corporation.
"
1844,"CHAPTER I
"
1845,"Objectives and Politics:
"
1846,"Economic development is a continuing process.
"
1847,"Its am is to gradually increase public welfare and to prepare the infrastructure needed for accelerating economic growth.
"
1848,"Although an increase in production is the first step towards the goal of development, this goal in itself is not sufficient to fulfil the aspirations of the people, especially in the present stage of our development.
"
1849,"As production increases, a suitable framework for equitable distribution should also be extended. Expansion of foreign trade is also important when considered in terms of our growing need to obtain capital goods and technical know-how in the course of development.
"
1850,"The country has acquired several years of experience in the management of development programmes.
"
1851,"Future development will be built upon the foundation of economic and social achievements of this period.
"
1852,"Since most of the resources to be available for the Fourth Plan will be needed for completing existing projects begun during the earlier Plans, it is imperative that we consolidate the continuing projects rather then involve evident that our major effort during the Plan period will be directed to ward furthering the successes of past planning, thereby providing new impetus to future developmental activities.
"
1853,"The success of the Fourth Plan will depend in large measure upon the amount of investment drawn out of available resources for various development programmes and projects. The objectives of these programmes and projects must be consistent with sectoral objectives based upon the framework of national goals and policies.
"
1854,"Therefore, while drafting the Plan, national gals and policies must be set prior to sectoral objectives and policies.
"
1855,"Investment resources available for development programs and projects during the Plan period will be guided by the following objectives.
"
1856,"Since the desirable goals of national development are numerous, it would not be possible either to spell them out or to fulfill them all at once.
"
1857,"However, some basic objectives which are consistent with the Panchayat System and the guiding principles of the Constitution and of highest priority are as follows:
"
1858,"1. To maximize output:
"
1859,"Increase of public welfare is co-terminus with a higher level of economic development which, in turn, results in increased production.
"
1860,"In order to end economic exploitation, suitable changes in the system and organization of both distribution and exchange should accompany increases in production.
"
1861,"Since the dangers of exploitation and undue economic pressure are great  in a poverty stricken society like ours, our initial effort must strike at the very root of poverty.
"
1862,"Since low productivity is the root cause of poverty, in order to create a society free from exploitation, it is first necessary to increase production to maximum extent.
"
1863,"This objective is essential, not only from the point of view of modernizing our economy on  a sound basis, but also from the point of view of inspiring public confidence in the development efforts by providing tangible improvement in the work-a-day lives of the people.
"
1864,"Due to lack of necessary data, it is not possible to calculate the actual rate of growth of gross domestic product during the Fourth Plan period. However, on the basis of the data that was available during the drafting of the Fourth Plan, the proposed investment and projects to be  completed during the Plan period are likely to generate an increase in GDP of 4% per annum during the Plan period.
"
1865,"2. To establish the base for sustained and long-term economic growth (viz. Transport, Communications, Power etc.
"
1866,"3. To expand and diversity international trade : Because Nepal is land-locked and lacks long experience in foreign trade, expansion and diversification of international trade have become major goals of economic development.
"
1867,"With a desirable expansion and diversification of export trade, our economic growth would gather momentum and our capacity to import the essential materials needed for development would be enhanced.
"
1868,"Economic relations between Nepal and India will continue to remain close, nevertheless, diversification of Nepal’s foreign trade is essential because sole dependence on a single country undesirable from an economic point of view.
"
1869,"4. To secure accelerated pace of development with maximum economic stability by controlling price level:
"
1870,"Economic development and stability should be considered together in order to avoid any adverse effect of development which might result in the economy.
"
1871,"Economic stability is not limited to price stability.
"
1872,"Rather, it would encompass all the economic policies adopted by the government in keeping with the aims and objectives of the Plan.
"
1873,"5. To make effective use of manpower resources and to control population growth:
"
1874,"The Panchayat System has envisaged a social order which is free of undue economic exploitation of individuals or class by any other individual or class.
"
1875,"Truly speaking, the five year period of the Fourth Plan will be too short to fulfill the long-term goals of the system.
"
1876,"It is, however, important that the programmes of each development plan are designed to push the country towards that ultimate goal.
"
1877,"It was for the purpose of social justice and economic progress that the land reform, ‘Mulki Ain’ (code of civil and criminal laws) was adopted and that the development programme in agriculture, industry, education, health, and roads were implemented on a county-wide basis.
"
1878,"In the Fourth Plan period these programmes will continue to expand in order to consolidate the base for the establishment of a society free from exploitation.
"
1879,"Regarding policies to achieve the above mentioned national objectives, the following factors will definitely get due consideration:
"
1880,"1. Mobilization of internal resources:
"
1881,"It is imperative that the rates of investment are capital formation be increased to the maximum possible extent in order to accelerate the pace of development and to create the required infrastructure.
"
1882,"Obviously, availability of investment capital is essential.
"
1883,"Although foreign aid plays an important role in the Fourth Plan , increases in development expenditure are dependent upon mobilization of internal resources.
"
1884,"This is also essential in order to decrease the country’s dependence upon foreign aid.
"
1885,"Timely steps on the part of the Government would include increases in taxation as well as austere measures regarding recurring expenditures.
"
1886,"It has been observed that the public sector and commercial organizations should also contribute to the   mobilization of internal resources.
"
1887,"Another essential policy should be directed towards increasing the level of savings in the private sector.
"
1888,"Domestic savings from the private sector will have to be mobilized. The policy should be aimed at encouraging the private sector to save more from its additional income, as well as making institutional reforms.
"
1889,"In addition, the channels of investing the mobilized savings must be made more attractive and effective.
"
1890,"In order to fulfill the aim of maximum increases in production, the investment rate must increase. There should be simultaneous changes in the investment pattern and diversion of resources into more productive sectors.
"
1891,"In view of our present economic condition, emphasis must be placed on agriculture development so that maximum increase in production can be accomplished even while utilizing limited investment funds.
"
1892,"The tendency to increase expenditure in the social sector on education and health should not be encouraged. Greater emphasis will be made to re-enforce already existing facilities that to expand activities in this field.
"
1893,"In the industrial sector, attention has to be  paid towards creating appropriate condition to attract private sector investment.
"
1894,"In order to give impetus to agro-based industries in accordance with the objectives set forth in the Fourth Plan , the current policies will have to be reviewed and priorities (in industry) will have to be changed.
"
1895,"In the transport and communications sector, the determining criteria for additional facilities should be linked directly to the needs of the various factorial programmes and to long-term development needs.
"
1896,"Austerity has to be strictly followed in different sector, including building construction.
"
1897,"Attention must be paid to inter-linked projects making sure that they are balanced since discrepancies in one sector may have adverse effects in another one. Due attention should also be paid to regional and different geographic interlinkages and balance.
"
1898,"If this pattern is followed, maximum utilization of available resources can be ensured.
"
1899,"2. Concentration of limited resources:
"
1900,"As limited resources scattered in different projects and programmes are not likely to be utilized in the optimum manner, they should be concentrated in those areas capable of creating maximum increases in production. The logic behind this is that the results of developments activities of some important sectors would create a favorable reaction and therefore create a viable base for future development.
"
1901,"It has been observed that limited sources can be concentrated from an administrative view point as well.
"
1902,"The policy of concentrating resources has been used for working out details concerning regional development in the Fourth Plan period.
"
1903,"It has been agreed that the unequal level of development among the various regions must be narrowed down.
"
1904,"The meaning of regional consideration in the Pla n is not that the development of all regions be the same. It is essential that attempts should be made to create a balance between national and regional development by the proper utilization of resources and the extension of the benefits of development work to as many different areas as possible.
"
1905,"However, steps which will help to achieve the long term goals can be taken during the initial period. During the Fourth Plan period, efforts will be made to create growth centres for the selected regions.
"
1906,"It is natural that certain regions will have greater potential for development due to geographical, economic and social factors.
"
1907,"Therefore, identification of such regions id essential. However, development of remote areas is to be kept in mind in order to enable the national economy to progress continuously.
"
1908,"It is essential that the long-term policy be adopted for the development of hilly regions during the Fourth Plan in order to create a base for economic growth by providing work opportunities to the population of those areas with low levels of resources per capita.
"
1909,"On the basis of this policy, attention will be focused on a unification of hilly areas and Terai areas by increasing economic relations which would result from the implementation of regional development plans.
"
1910,"Accordingly, the selection of areas to initiate the regional development programme will be based on the existence of transportation and other facilities and the potential for their expansion.
"
1911,"3. Incentive for investment in private sector:
"
1912,"The public sector has to play an active role in the economic development of countries in the preliminary stages of economic development.
"
1913,"Although the policy of creating basic infrastructure is intended to provide incentives for investment in the private sector, if the provision  of such facilities does not result in increase in the quantity of productive investment the government will have to be active in directly establishing industrial projects.
"
1914,"While doing so, there might arise problems relating to management and operation in such industries.
"
1915,"If the management  of public sector industrial enterprises is not satisfactory, the consumers will suffer unwarranted difficulties. Consequently, there will be a substantial rate of decrease in governmental income which may further discourage the private sector.
"
1916,"Nepal does not lack private capital, although it does lack opportunities for productive investment.
"
1917,"After implementation of the land reform programme, capital in the hands of landlords has remained idle due to a lack of investment opportunities in the economic sectors. There would be a considerable increase in the amount of private investment from the landlords if the avenues to sound investment were opened up.
"
1918,"It is, therefore, necessary to work towards creating an environment favorable to industrial and business investment.
"
1919,"The following measures shall be taken during the Fourth Plan period for the purpose of augmenting private sector investment:
"
1920,"(a) Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) will be well organized and made more effective in its functioning;
"
1921,"(b) Current industrial policies and priorities will be reviewed and the new priorities will be spelled out in clear terms according to the objectives of the Fourth Plan in order to encourage industries by providing incentives and necessary facilities;
"
1922,"(c) The need for various kinds of trained manpower for future industrial development will be assessed and training programmes and facilities will accordingly be worked out;
"
1923,"(d) Existing financial institutions will be encouraged to advance loans to those landlords willing to sell their lands to the tillers so that they may invest in selected industries;
"
1924,"(e) Incentives will be given to financial institutions to help expand and develop the industries already established; (f) The policies and programmes of cottage and small scale industries’ development thus  far adopted shall be evaluated.
"
1925,"Future programmes encouraging this sector will be based upon a few selected industries suitable to different regions.
"
1926,"Assistance and facilities to be provided by the government will be decided accordingly.
"
1927,"For the last few years government has involved itself directly or indirectly in commercial activities for two obvious reasons: (a) to regularly provide consumable goods of adequate quantity at fair prices to the consumers, and (2) increase government revenue by earning a fair profit which can be invested on development works.
"
1928,"Except for the above two reasons, government interference and competition with the private sector is undesirable. Nor should the government interfere in the private sector when it is operating within government regulations and in the social interest.
"
1929,"This will be the guiding consideration for the government before it takes any commercial steps during the Fourth Plan period.
"
1930,"In fact, the private and government sector are two integral parts of a single process, and economic development is heavily dependent upon the progress and contributions of both.
"
1931,"4. Trade policy:
"
1932,"According to the obje ctives of the Fourth Plan to expand and diversify foreign trade, production of exportable goods will be stressed. Since processed goods fetch a higher price than unprocessed and raw goods, our efforts should be directed towards the establishment of agro- based industries.
"
1933,"Results of trade talks with India, due to be concluded during 1970, and the subsequent trade treaty will be crucially important for the future expansion of Nepalese foreign trade.
"
1934,"It is, therefore, necessary to determine now the priorities, on the basis of which, the trade relations with India should be discussed, as well as to review the economic relations of Nepal with India.
"
1935,"Appropriate revision in the current bonus system shall also be made in order to promote  export trade.
"
1936,"The foreign exchange policy to be defined in this context will also indicate the most favourable level of foreign currency reserves to maintain and the measures to better utilize our surplus reserves.
"
1937,"In order to broaden the base of social justice and to lessen undue economic pressure during the Fourth Plan period, genuine peasants will be given the opportunity to increase  production by a more effective implementation of land reform programme.
"
1938,"Due consideration will  also be given to the regulation of production costs and the quality of produced goods in the interest of pubic welfare. To enable a majority of the people to contribute to national production, small industries will be developed and extended in a well- organized way.
"
1939,"Cooperatives will also be strengthened on a viable economic basis. Timely changes will also be made in the tax and land revenue systems of HMG in order to make them more just and equitable.
"
1940,"According to the Panchayat System’s goal of enlisting greater cooperation of the people in the economic development of the country, attempts will be made more effectively to make involve Panchayats of various levels in the process of both plan formulation and implementation in order to make the participation of people in the local development work more active and dynamic.
"
1941,"PLAN OUTLAY & ITS ALLOCATION
"
1942,"Review of the Third Plan:
"
1943,"The Third Plan attempted to increase the Gross Domestic Product by 19 per cent. The Plan envisaged an outlay of Rs 2,500 million, of which Rs 1,740 million was the public sector share, with the panchayat sector and the private sector share receiving Rs 240 million and Rs 520 million respectively.
"
1944,"After including the Government Grants-in-Aid to Panchayat of Rs 40 million and equity investment in public sector of Rs 20 million, the public sector outlay for the Plan period would come to Rs 1,800 million.
"
1945,"In addition, the Plan also envisaged the provision of Rs 150 million of credit to the private sector through financial institutions in the public sector.
"
1946,"Compared to the above investment target, it is estimated that the actual development expenditure in the public sector during the Plan period would be Rs1,780 million .This figure is based on the actual expenditure in the first three years of the Plan period , the revised estimate of 1968-69 and the original budget estimate of 1969-70 .
"
1947,"With regard to investment in the panchayat and private sectors, no information is available.
"
1948,"The details of public sector expenditures are given in Table 1. Although the above expenditure were incorporated into the development budget, they also include regular expenditures.
"
1949,"It is, therefore, necessary to ascertain the amount of ‘actual’ development expenditure incurred during the Plan period .In accordance with the newly adopted classification system (of regular and development expenditure) followed by the Ministry of Finance on the advice of the National Planning Commission, the actual development expenditure for the Third Plan period will be only Rs 1,420 million.
"
1950,"This estimate is based mainly upon the analysis of the budget for the year 1968-69.
"
1951,"The above table reveals that during the Third Plan period development expenditure in the public sector, under the new classification, is Rs 360 million less than development expenditure under the prevailing system.
"
1952,"When the increase in national output is compared to the expenditure, it becomes necessary to determine the volume of the actual capital investment out of such increase.
"
1953,"Since the recurring expenditures shall be included in development outlays under the new classification, it is clear that the volume of capital investment shall be reduced by less than 1,420 million.
"
1954,"The estimation of expenditure during the Fourth Plan period is based on the new classification  of the development expenditure. Accordingly, provisions for preparing the development and regular budgets (according to the new classification) shall be made.
"
1955,"The details of this are shown in Annex 2.
"
1956,"Priority of the Fourth Plan:
"
1957,"In conformity with the objectives and policies of the Fourth Plan, priority has been given to the continuing projects, which were started during the Third Plan period or to those projects related to foreign aid.
"
1958,"With the objectives of producing more within a short period of time and the creation of the infrastructure for accelerating the process of economic development in the future, priority has been given to the development of basic sectors like transport and communications during the Fourth Plan period.
"
1959,"The lack of transport and communications has become the main deterrent to accelerating the process of economic development.
"
1960,"No large scale development in the agricultural and industrial sectors is possible without adequate communications facilities.
"
1961,"Therefore, as some new projects essential for regional development have to be planned along with the uncompleted projects started during the Third Plan period, the greater portion of expenditure in the public sector has been envisaged for the development of transport and communications facilities.
"
1962,"More than 93 per cent of the manpower in Nepal is engaged in agriculture. Agricultural development is, therefore, very important and the improvement of the standard of living of the majority of the people is possible only by increasing agricultural production.
"
1963,"Increased food production is essential for accelerating the speed of development and to eliminate the deterrents to development.
"
1964,"Agricultural products also provide the raw materials required for various industries.
"
1965,"In view of these factors the agricultural development programme has occupied an important place in the Plan.
"
1966,"Inorder of priority, industry is third after transport and agriculture.
"
1967,"Although the main responsibility for developing industries falls upon private sector, His Majesty’s Government may involve itself when the private sector is unable to develop certain basic industries.
"
1968,"During the Fourth Plan period, firm reform measures will be undertaken for the reinforcement of industries that have already been established in the public sector.
"
1969,"Although it is desirable to expand such services as education, health etc., the improvement and strengthening of existing facilities, rather than expansion of them, has been considered more appropriate during the Plan period because of increasing expenditures in this sector.
"
1970,"Expenditure Required for the Fourth Plan:
"
1971,"With regard to the above mentioned priorities and the fulfillment of the objectives and programs of the various sectors, the total expenditure planned is Rs 3,540 million.
"
1972,"The estimated breakdown by sectors is as follows:
"
1973,"Expenditure in Public Sector:
"
1974,"Out of the total expenditure of the Fourth Plan, the estimated expenditure envisaged for the public sector is Rs 2,550 million.
"
1975,"Also, His Majesty’s Government will make available Rs 20 million as a development grant for the panchayat sector.
"
1976,"Thus His Majesty’s government will allocate Rs 2,570 million for the development budget of the Fourth Plan.
"
1977,"Considering the objectives and the amount allocated in the public sector, the average annual expenditure comes to be 500 million of rupees.
"
1978,"It shows a significant increase when compared with the annual expenditure of Rs 290 million during the Third Plan period under the new classification of development expenditure.
"
1979,"The estimated expenditure for FY 1970-71 is Rs 450 million.
"
1980,"Besides, if the proposed reforms in the administrative machinery materialize thereby making it more organized and systematic, the chances of successfully implementing the increasing numbe r of projects will improve.
"
1981,"Nepal Industrial Development Corporation shall make available Rs 120 million to lend to the private sector.
"
1982,"In the foregoing chapter, the available resources for achieving the specified goals in both the private and panchayat sectors have been analyzed, and it has been shown that the required resources will be available. It has o already been stated that out of the total financial resources
"
1983,"In the process of economic development it is necessary to think of the maintenance of a fiscal balance between resources and investment as an objective of planning.
"
1984,"But, giving due consideration to the minimum requirements, if the available savings for investment is insufficient to accelerate development activities, the possible impact of such an imbalance on the physical system should also be considered.
"
1985,"But due to a lack of data on the national income and balance of payments, it is natural that the necessary information of savings and investments is also not available.
"
1986,"Therefore, with the view of maintaining of financial balance in the fiscal system on the basis of available data, the estimate of financial resources potentially available for the public sector has been made for the Fourth Plan period.
"
1987,"Estimation of resources which may be available in the public sector during the Fourth Plan period has been based on the following factors: changes in the government revenue and regular expenditure during preceding years; the possible changes in the future; assumptions concerning the proper utilization of foreign exchange; projected national and foreign credit; and the level of deficit financing which can be tolerated without adversely effecting the fiscal system by increasing the politically practical tax burden.
"
1988,"I accordance with the long-term objective of accelerating development activities and gradually reducing the dependence upon foreign aid, efforts are being made to reduced the foreign aid ratio in the Fourth Plan.
"
1989,"Following are the summary of the resources:
"
1990,"a. Revenue surplus: The estimated revenue of Rs 430 million for the FY 1969-70 shows an annual increase of 5 per cent in revenue during the Fourth Plan period. On the assumption of an annual increase of 10 per cent in regular expenditures, a revenue surplus of Rs 330 million will become available for the Fourth Plan.
"
1991,"During the seven years between FY 1963-64 to FY 1969-70 total revenue increased at the rate of 19 per cent per annum.
"
1992,"Such a significant increase was made possible primarily because of periodic increases in various taxes and not because of improved tax administration. The development of the general fiscal system has also helped increase revenue.
"
1993,"As such, while estimating the rate of increase in future revenue separate analysis should be made of the development of the fiscal system and of the increases in the rate of taxation in order to determine their relative importance in the overall increase in revenue.
"
1994,"During the above mentioned seven years, the impact of development itself is responsible for no more than an annual 8 per cent increase in revenue.
"
1995,"Assuming fixed prices, it seems that general development has contributed to the increased revenue by 4 per cent annually.
"
1996,"Therefore, considering the estimated revenue of Rs 430 million in FY 1969-70, the increase in revenue during the Fourth Plan period will be 5 per cent per annum, assuming fixed prices. When viewed from the experience of past years, such an increase seems optimistic.
"
1997,"There are several factors which might reduce the increase of revenue to less than 5 per cent.
"
1998,"While difficult to quantify, some of these factors are: (1) while considering the price index for agricultural production in India, the export sector cannot made its complete contribution to the nation al income of Nepal, and thereby creates possible difficulties in increasing revenue from other sectors.
"
1999,"(2) In the same way, increases in revenue are adversely affected by regulations concerning the gift parcel system.
"
2000,"However, the favorable impact of economic development on revenue resulting from the proposed increases in investment during the Fourth Plan period should also be considered.
"
2001,"At the recommendation of the National Planning Commission, the Finance Ministry will adopt a new classification of regular and development expenditures.
"
2002,"According to the new classification system, some of the amounts under the development budget heads will come under regular budget heads.
"
2003,"The difference between the current system and the new classification system may be shown on the basis of FY 1968-69.
"
2004,"According to the prevailing prices, regular expenditures seem to have increased by 12-13 per cent per annum during the seven year period from FY 1963-64 to FY 1969-70.
"
2005,"But according to the fixed prices of FY 1963-64, the increase has been only 10 per cent.
"
2006,"According to the fixed prices of FY 1969-70, it is estimated that regular expenditures shall increase by 10 per cent during the Fourth
"
2007,"Plan period. To achieve this, emphasis should be given to administrative efficiency and frugality.
"
2008,"Generally, salaries and allowances constitute the largest share of regular expenditure.
"
2009,"Based on the statements given above, total revenue shall be Rs 2,490 million and total regular expenditure shall be 2,160 million during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2010,"Accordingly, a surplus revenue of Rs 330 million shall be available for the Fourth Plan.
"
2011,"b. Additional revenue from the tax changed: Increase in revenue, due to changes in the rate of the prevailing taxes, may be more difficult to achieve during the Fourth Plan.
"
2012,"Because of increases in custom duties, income tax and sales tax during recent years, the opportunity for increasing revenue by changing the rate of taxation seems very limited.
"
2013,"If the minimum resources required for development were not made available through internal resources (by changing existing rates of taxation and by making tax administration more efficient), it is clear that the pace of development would be affected adversely and Nepal’s dependency upon foreign aid would increase.
"
2014,"From economic and technical points of view, agriculture may make a great contribution to increase revenue. However, the current land tax sys tem should be changed scientifically in order to make it just.
"
2015,"The working efficiency of government-owned industrial, financial and business institutions should be improved and operated more frugally, thereby contributing to increases in revenue.
"
2016,"Therefore, along with the changes in the prevailing rate of taxation and improvements in tax administration, the earnings, from better operated government-owned corporations, will be Rs 300 million , which will also be available for the Fourth Plan .
"
2017,"Considering the present situation of financial institutions in the public sector (like commercial banks, insurance corporation, provident fund etc.
"
2018,"), it seems possible to collect Rs 150 million or more from the domestic loan. It is not the collection of the loan, but the extent to which government can bear the burden of future credit and the expenditure required to provide resources from other sources in comparison to domestic credit which are the factors determining the quantity of domestic credit.
"
2019,"The study of savings which can be invested at present reveals that the terms and interest of the prevailing loans have made domestic credit relatively more expensive from the government viewpoint.
"
2020,"Consideration should be given to provide resources from deficit financing instead of domestic credit.
"
2021,"Although the possibility of providing development funds from deficit financing is limited, such provision, within certain limits, can reduce government liabilities to a great extent.
"
2022,"The result of the investment by deficit financing, the adverse impact on the price and the balance of payment of the country has generally determined the limit of deficit financing.
"
2023,"As the proposed deficit financing will reduce the reserve of convertible foreign exchange and will be spent at the same ratio for importing physical resources for development, there is no possibility that adverse effect on the internal price situation will be caused.
"
2024,"One of the main causes of monetary inflation during the past years has been the continuous increase in foreign exchange expected to be earned during the past years, the Fourth Plan period, the current savings, the quantity of the resources available from domestic sources, the minimum saving of foreign exchange required to increase foreign trade, the quantity of convertible foreign exchange in relation to the money supply, and the quantity of foreign exchange required for the development works in the public sectors during the Fourth Plan, the proposed deficit of Rs 200 million is necessary to accelerate development activities.
"
2025,"e. Deficit: The resources available from domestic sources for operating various development projects  show a deficit of Rs 100 million. This deficit shall be met by the saving of foreign exchange, if possible .
"
2026,"The estimates of resources reveal that the present savings of foreign currency is more than future requirements.
"
2027,"However, the above savings can be spent only when foreign currency is in deficit. Otherwise, the required amount will have to be collected by the mobilization of domestic resources.
"
2028,"f. foreign aid: During the Third Plan period, foreign aid amounted to Rs 950 million including both  loans and grants.
"
2029,"The following table shows the actual amount received during the first three years of the Third Plan, the revised amount during the fourth year, and the estimated amount of the fifth year.
"
2030,"The estimate of foreign aid during FY 1969-70 is considerably higher than in FY 1968-69.
"
2031,"However, considering the experiences gained during the Third Plan period, the type of projects to be operated during the Fourth Plan period, and the quantity of domestic resources available for local expenses, estimated foreign aid for the Fourth Plan is expected to total Rs 1,490 million; Rs 1,290 million in the form of grants and Rs 200 million as loans.
"
2032,"The following table shows the amount to be provided by HG for regular and development expenditures and the sources of each during the Fourth Plan period. The table gives a clear picture of the complete financial situation of the public sector and the relation between expenditure and resources during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2033,"CHAPTER IV
"
2034,"POPULATION AND MANPOWER
"
2035,"The Growth in Population
"
2036,"The first census of the Kingdom of Nepal was taken in the year 1911.
"
2037,"Although an increase of only 3,841,650 persons or 68.12 per cent has been observed during the period between 1911 and 1961, this small increase might well be the result of the various natural calamities, the two world wars and the political upheaval in the country.
"
2038,"However, the statistics of births and deaths made available from the census of 1961 shows a growth rate of 2.0 per cent annum.
"
2039,"Though data on births and deaths (during a year preceding the census) were collected during the census of 1961, neither set of figures is reliable.
"
2040,"The data on deaths seem particularly less reliable than on births.
"
2041,"The total population recorded in the various censuses is shown in the table below:
"
2042,"In the absence of the necessary reliable statistics of births and deaths, it is not easy to make population projections.
"
2043,"It is possible to formulate informative and reliable estimates of national population trends only when reliable statistics of births and deaths and knowledge of the possible results of existing programmes effecting births and deaths are available.
"
2044,"Due to a partial lack of the necessary information, it is natural to encounter difficulty in making a scientific study analyzing the population.
"
2045,"However, estimates of the future population for the period between 1961 to 1981 have been prepared on the basis of the available statistics and assuming that the sex-age –adjusted birth rate of 40 per thousand will remain constant throughout the period of projection and that due to a decline in the death rate there will be an annual increase of 0.5 year in life expectancy.
"
2046,"The expectation of life was estimated by comparing the age -specific death rates obtained from the census of 1961 and the population survey of 1963 to the age-specific death rates given in the United Nation’s Model Life - Tables.
"
2047,"Estimated Population Growth
"
2048,"From the above Table, the population is expected to increase by 863,537; 1,145,178 and 1,384,468 respectively each quinquennium beginning in 1961.
"
2049,"In other words, the annual rate of population growth for different periods will be as follows:
"
2050,"A difference has been observed between the rates of population growth shown in the above Table and those given in the population and Manpower Chapter in the Third Plan.
"
2051,"This difference is due to the different methods employed in estimating future population.
"
2052,"In the population chapter of the Third Plan, a very simple growth pattern for each quinquennium was assumed and then from the estimated total population, age composition figure (i.e. 0-14 years; 15-59 years and 60 years and over) were estimated.
"
2053,"The present estimate, obtained by the Cohort Survival Method after a detailed analytical study of the available data on births and deaths, is definitely more reliable.
"
2054,"In spite of a Herculean effort, the birth rate tends toward neither its possible minimum nor its possible maximum.
"
2055,"The birth rate of any country and of any time period is an expression of the culture of that particular population, tending towards a level which represents a balance of conditions that affect it both in a positive and negative sense.
"
2056,"Thus, to bring a substantial change in the birth rate, the initial requisites are to bring required changes in the economic and social conditions, cultural patterns and aspirations towards life of the common man.
"
2057,"The second need is to create an institution such as the family planning programme, which can sufficiently consolidate the successes brought through the above mentioned changes.
"
2058,"Population density increases with the growth of population.
"
2059,"Specifically, the density of population in Nepal is 173.2 persons per square mile.
"
2060,"As has been stated above, facilities like education, health, housing, etc. and employment opportunities in various economically developed fields would be more difficult to provide with a high rate of growth in population.
"
2061,"If the estimated growth of population were to take place as mentioned above, it would be more and more difficult to fulfill the increasing needs in the field of education.
"
2062,"In comparison with the year 1961, the number of children of school-age 6-11 years in the primary level would increase by 41,119 and the number of children of school-age in the middle level would increase by 25 per cent more and the more number in higher education would increase by 39 per cent in 1981. As shown by the census, in the year 1961, 48.5 per cent of the total population and 80. 45 per cent of the working age group 15-59 are the only ones who are economically active.
"
2063,"There should be ample opportunities for work in various new fields which should provide for a substantial growth of the labour force.
"
2064,"The development of industries and occupations giving opportunities to housewives and students would allow them to become economically active, and therefore encourage the growth of the economically active population. Another interesting fact revealed by the population census of 1961 was the level of employment in agriculture. Out of the total economically active population of 4,306,839, 4,040,607 are engaged in agricultural work.
"
2065,"On the basis of the above analysis, the influences of various population groups expected during the Fourth Plan can be studied.
"
2066,"The age group distribution of the population during the Fourth Plan is shown in the Table below: According to this Table, there is an increment of 196,677 children of school-going age (5-14 age group) during the Fourth Plan.
"
2067,"At the end of the Third Plan, only 35 per cent of the children in this group had an opportunity to go to school.
"
2068,"Judging from this information, the target of education, especially in the primary and middle levels, should be increased substantially.
"
2069,"It will be essential to create jobs for about 525,000 persons within this economically active group during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2070,"If not, the rate of employment will be even lower than during the Third Plan.
"
2071,"In this estimate, the number of individuals who are under 15 and 59 years have not been included although they might actually be employed. In order to increase productivity in the labour force, this practices will be discouraged.
"
2072,"Gradually the work done by people outside of the 15-59 age group will be taken over by the new labourers. If this were not done, the numbers of persons looking for jobs would continue to increase and would be higher than the above mentioned number.
"
2073,"Also, if an ambitious plan could be formulated to activate the 1.14 million unemployed persons by the end of the Third Plan period, the number of persons depending on others for their subsistence would decrease and the standard of living of general people would actually increase.
"
2074,"Industrial classification of the labour force shows the degree of dependency of the population upon different industries, as well as being a main measuring device to determine how much the country has developed.
"
2075,"According to the national census taken in the year 1961, the economically active population was about 4.6 million, of which 93.83 per cent were dependent upon agriculture. Only 6.17 per cent were employed in other sectors of the economy.
"
2076,"No reliable statistics have yet been collected which can indicate the extent of change brought to the employment structure by economic development during the past nine years. As a result, the percentage of people who have shifted from agriculture to other industries is not known.
"
2077,"Although reliable statistics on this question should be available from the national census to be held in 1971, there is little reason to believe that there has been any remarkable change in the industrial distribution of the labour force. This is because of the underdeveloped nature of the country and the fact that the rate of economic development has been minimal.
"
2078,"Although it is likely that increased investment during the Fourth Plan period will result in effective utilization of the agricultural labour force, there is little likelihood that the desired change in the industrial structure of the non-agricultural sector will occur.
"
2079,"Technical Manpower:
"
2080,"At the base year of the Fourth Plan (1969 -70), the number of highly trained persons (graduates) in the technical and scientific fields such as engineering, health, education and commerce is estimated to be 2,897.
"
2081,"The number of graduates in both technical and non-technical fields is estimated to be 7,648. Also, even those who complete their studies during the Plan period should be considered.
"
2082,"Their number is expected to reach 2,364 by the fourth year of the Fourth Plan.
"
2083,"The breakdown of the estimate is given in the following Table.
"
2084,"During the last Plan period, several technical and vocational training centers were opened in order to provide middle and lower level technical facilities within the country.
"
2085,"The total number of middle and lower level technical persons during this period is estimated to be 5,094. This includes the number of persons already trained by these institutions and the number of persons to complete training in the year 1969-70, assuming that the number of persons of trainees remains at the same level as in the past.
"
2086,"Since training such manpower requires a maximum of three years, training facilities will be made available during the Fourth Plan period according to the number required.
"
2087,"The number of trained persons as of 1969-70 can be classified into the following groups:
"
2088,"Some 1,000 Nepalese have received miscellaneous vocational and technical training during their service with the British-Gurkha Army which will also help to fulfill the need for technically trained manpower.
"
2089,"The above description does not give us a very positive picture of the ratio between the higher level and the middle and the lower level technically trained persons available in the country. The number of lower and middle level trained persons is not adequate to help the higher level personnel function most effectively.
"
2090,"This shows the need to put greater emphasis on the training of middle and lower level manpower.
"
2091,"In the training centers of the country, duplication in training subjects, oversupply in certain trades, and scarcity in some others have also been evident. Thus, during the Fourth Plan period, efforts must be made to coordinate the training of personnel with the requirements for skilled manpower.
"
2092,"In the health sector, the number of specialized doctors and well trained nurses falls short of those required.
"
2093,"However, the number of indigenous health worke rs (i.e. Kabiraj, Vaidyas, etc.) could be fully mobilized, thereby increasing the number of facilities in the health services.
"
2094,"The number of such indigenous health workers in the country is estimated to be around 200 at the present time.
"
2095,"In the absence of some basic information, it was not possible to estimate scientifically the required technical manpower for the Fourth Plan period.
"
2096,"The first important goal to keep in mind when considering training during the Plan period is the elimination of duplication in training facilities.
"
2097,"However, the opening of new institutions will not be encouraged until a thorough study has been made regarding the types of manpower required and the means to fulfill these demands.
"
2098,"Since on-the-job training of skilled workers and upgrading training programmes are more effective, such programmes will be implemented wherever necessary.
"
2099,"Employment
"
2100,"The employment of the labour force is a vital factor in a developmental plan. The main objective of economic planning should include the provision of employment opportunities to those looking for employment.
"
2101,"According to the latest estimate, the number of persons of working age, i.e. between 15- 59 years, is 6,072,000.
"
2102,"In the absence of any employment survey, it is difficult to ascertain the total unemployed population in the country.
"
2103,"Since Nepal is basically an agricultural economy, it is natural that under-employment is visible everywhere as it is in other predominantly agricultural economies.
"
2104,"Distinguished unemployment is also visible in several areas.
"
2105,"In the field of trained manpower, those who have received technical training have been able to find employment. However, surveys and studies have indicated that persons having non-technical or arts education are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable employment.
"
2106,"Among the educated, the number of persons looking for non-technical jobs has increased tremendously.
"
2107,"More suitable jobs will be required during the Fourth Plan period for the additional population that will join the labour force.
"
2108,"Since most of the population is dependent upon agriculture for its livelihood, there is much under-employment in the country.
"
2109,"If sufficient employment opportunities cannot be created for the increased labour force in the non-agricultural sectors, the unemployment problem might take an unpleasant trend.
"
2110,"In view of constant progress in the field of education, the number of educated persons is expected to increase greatly. In view of this, it is essential that arrangements be made to provide the educated manpower with ample job opportunities.
"
2111,"Keeping these facts in mind, all possible attempts will be made to create and expand employment opportunities in all economic sectors in hopes of solving the problem of unemployment and under-employment during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2112,"In the existing condition of the economy agricultural sector should play an important role consistence with the underlying objectives of the Fourth Plan to maximize output by concentrating available resources and creating basic conditions necessary for acceleration of economic  development in the country.
"
2113,"As a matter of fact, in an economy which is still in the initial stage of development, economic progress depends to a large extent on the development of agriculture has become even more essential in order to lay down a sound base for further expansion of the non-agricultural sector during the long-run process of development.
"
2114,"Although a number of development works have been undertaken in different sectors of the economy, there has been virtually no noteworthy change in the basic condition of agriculture.
"
2115,"According to an estimate for 1967/68, agriculture accounts for 66 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product.
"
2116,"It is estimated that more than 93 per cent of the total labour force of the country is engaged in agriculture.
"
2117,"Besides, agricultural products are the major items in the export trade of the country.
"
2118,"Of total exports, food grains alone constitute about 70 per cent.
"
2119,"In spite of being predominantly an agricultural country, the level of land productivity is low.
"
2120,"In addition, increased population is exerting heavy pressure on cultivated land, consequently giving rise to the critical problem of providing gainful employment to the growing labour force in agriculture.
"
2121,"Under these circumstances emphasis needs to be given to transforming the tradition bound and largely monsoon based subsistence agriculture into a modern and commercial enterprise.
"
2122,"It is necessary to recognize that the farmers play a predominant role in attaining the goals  of agricultural development.
"
2123,"Although the over-all targets of the agricultural programme are determined by the government, their fulfillment essentially depends on the contribution of all the farmers and families who are engaged in agriculture.
"
2124,"The availability of basic agricultural inputs and services on the one hand and a just reward for their efforts on the other should be guaranteed to the farmers only in this context can the agricultural development programmes undertaken by the government be meaningful.
"
2125,"Progress in the Agricultural Sector
"
2126,"Agricultural development has been emphasized by the government since the First Plan period.
"
2127,"As a result, adaptive research suited to the climatic conditions of the country has been conducted in different fields of agriculture. Results of that research found appropriate for adoption is disseminated to the farmers through the agricultural extension programme.
"
2128,"In addition, a nationwide land reform programme has been implemented during the Second Plan period in order to bring about institutional changes in traditional agriculture.
"
2129,"It is only in the Third Plan that the targets and programme of agricultural development have been fixed at the national level.
"
2130,"Agriculturaldevelopment was accorded topmost priority in the Third Plan. It was envisaged in this Plan to increase production of food grains by 15 per cent and production of cash crops by 73 per cent.
"
2131,"Accordingly production of food grains was to be increased from the estimated production of 3.27 million metric ton in 1964/65 to 3.77 million metric ton in 1969/70 and that of cash crops from 0.25 million metric ton in 0.39 million metric ton.
"
2132,"In order to accomplish these targets, the need for improving farm practices has been stressed; and accordingly, programmes for increasing the use of inputs like improved seeds, chemical fertilizer, pesticides and irrigation were incorporated into the Plan.
"
2133,"A review of progress made in the four years of the Plan period shows that the production of food grains has increased by only 10 per cent.
"
2134,"Looking at individual crops, the food grain production of wheat is far behind the target and all cash crops (except oil-seeds production) are far short of the targets.
"
2135,"Production targets of different crops and  progress made in the first four years of the Third Plan period are shown in the following Table: TABLE 18
"
2136,"It is clear from the above Table that the basic target of the Third Plan to increase production of food grains by 15 per cent will remain unfulfilled.
"
2137,"This shortfall in production of food grains and other crops is mainly due to the absence of adequately organizational effort and necessary inputs.
"
2138,"According to progress made during the last four years, the area and the use of chemical fertilizer is about 17 per cent of the target of the Third Plan.
"
2139,"Similarly, progress in the field of irrigation is much below the target.
"
2140,"Targets of various inputs inputs in the Third Plan and progress made in the past four are shown in the Table below: TABLE 19
"
2141,"Keeping in view the needs of agricultural development, several departments have been established in different fields of agriculture in order to conduct adaptive research which is suitable in different climate conditions of the country, on improved seeds of various crops, on livestock, and on fisheries, etc. and also to produce these inputs and make them available to a large number of farmers on a easy terms.
"
2142,"Under these departments there are at present 4 Agricultural Research Situations, 4 Agronomy Farms, 23 Horticulture Development Centres, 4 Livestock Development Farms, 3 Poultry Hatcheries, 34 Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries, 3 cheese Factories, 1 Dairy Centre and 10 Fishery Centres located in different parts of the country. With an aim of establishing a close link between agricultural research and farmers, an agriculture extension programmes is being implemented under the supervision of graduate level Agriculture
"
2143,"In the field of training during the last four years, more then 800 J.T.As. have been trained and 1870 farmers have received practical training.
"
2144,"An Agriculture College has been established to train higher level agricultural technicians inside the country.
"
2145,"In addition, the Agricultural Development Bank, Land Reform Savings Corporation and Agricultural Supply Corporation have been established in order to provide credit, fertilizers, seeds, implements and other inputs to the farms.
"
2146,"A Dairy Development Corporation has also been established to turn the dairy enterprise along business lines. A Minor Irrigation Department with the objective of developing irrigation facilities according to the needs of the agricultural development programmes has been established in the Ministry of Agriculture.
"
2147,"A perusal of the progress made so far in the development of agriculture and its present  status shows that the use of such high yielding inputs as improved seeds and fertilizer and the provision of irrigation facilities are at a very low level.
"
2148,"Out of 1,845,000 hectares of cultivated land, improved seeds have been used in only 102,630 hectares, and the annual use of chemical fertilizer ahs amounted to gross  24,000 metric ton.
"
2149,"Similarly, irrigation facilities have been provided to 117,500 hectares which is only 6 percent of the total cultivated land.
"
2150,"Furthermore, this includes minor irrigation from which it is naturally doubtful that permanent irrigation facilities will evolve.
"
2151,"Although in the last four years institutional reforms have been introduced and at the same time several institutions have been established in the agricultural sector, much remains to be done to make them more effective.
"
2152,"Present Obstacles and constraints
"
2153,"The agricultural development programme is at present beset by the following obstacles and constraints:
"
2154,"(a) There is no firm support for augmenting production by means of identifying improved seeds of agricultural crops that are suitable for adoption in different climatic conditions of the country, producing them on an experimental basis for a given period of time, and supplying them to the farmers in an extensive way.
"
2155,"(b) Allocated budgets are not efficiently utilized due to the absence of a well-organized administrative machinery.
"
2156,"There is a need for the timely release of fund and the allocation of personnel on the basis of the approved programme.
"
2157,"(c) At the Centre, there are separate departments looking after different activities in agriculture, but iner-departmental coordination and co-operation need to be mutually reinforcing.. similarly, at the district level each department has its own administrative offices.
"
2158,"Even in a single agricultural station or farm there are separate administrative offices as in the center.
"
2159,"But there is no office which is responsible for coordination, control and supervision.
"
2160,"Unless the present organizational set-up us basically changed, it is evident hat the programmes envisaged in the Fourth Plan are unlikely to be implement in an effective way.
"
2161,"(d) At the village level, there is no administrative machinery other then some J.T.As, to look after agricultural extension and other development works. As a result, necessary inputs and services are not funneled effectively from the center to the village level and made available to the framers.
"
2162,"In fact, the underlying objective of all the programmes undertaken by the government is to encourage and enable farmers to increase production.
"
2163,"It is, however, not unnatural that the agricultural development programme of the government has failed to make its anticipated impact at the village level since there has not been an effective network reaching the farmers.
"
2164,"(e) Projects and activities in agriculture are scattered over many areas, thus preventing projects and activities from being mutually reinforcing.
"
2165,"There may be a branch office of the Agriculture Development Bank, but with poor support facilities.
"
2166,"There may be an office of the Agriculture Supply Corporation, but with few or poor quality J. T. A’s. Research works are confined to the center or a few farms, and very little research has been adopted to local conditions.
"
2167,"(f) A sense of responsibility is not acquired unless evaluation is based on the ability to implement specified programme in an efficient utilized.
"
2168,"Similarly, the agricultural extension workers, who work at the village level, are not only inadequate in number, they are also poorly trained, lowly paid, and less experienced.
"
2169,"(g) There is evidently duplication of effort, in the activities of the various government organizations in the field of agriculture.
"
2170,"This has caused wastage of resources.
"
2171,"None of these organizations have been able to function as an effective agent in the provision of credit and other inputs required for the development of agriculture.
"
2172,"Even more complex is the problem of collecting loans.
"
2173,"(h) In order to increase agricultural extension agricultural production, it is essential to provide incentives to the actual farmers.
"
2174,"Moreover, no effort has been made so far to provide marketing and warehousing facilities.
"
2175,"Objectives, Policies and Priorities of Agricultural Development in the Fourth Plan  Objectives:
"
2176,"The agricultural development programme in the Fourth Plan will be geared to attain the following objectives through the maximization of output. This calls for increasing production of each crops, yields per land area & per capita yields:
"
2177,"(a) To ensure rising levels of consumption; (b) To provide greater exports;
"
2178,"(c) To supply an adequate amount of industrial raw-materials;
"
2179,"(d) To develop greater purchasing power for a larger segment off the population; and (e) To generate a capital base for savings and a broader tax base. Policies:
"
2180,"In accordance with the above mentioned objectives and also on the basis of the present status of the agricultural sector, the policies adopted in the Fourth Plan for the agricultural development are the following:
"
2181,"1. Efforts will be concentrated in a few selected fields so that the limited resources are not  scattered thinly over too many projects and over too many lines of production irrespective of their effectiveness. Accordingly the following modus operandi is adopted for the formulation of programmes:
"
2182,"(a) First, the country will be delineated into major agricultural areas according to  potential for food grain production, cash crop production, livestock development and dairy products, horticulture production, fishery, etc.,
"
2183,"(b) Second, areas or districts for each line of production where concentrated efforts will be made for providing the services and inputs required to achieve the targets in each line of production will be selected.
"
2184,"2. The many activities for agricultural development, like extension, research irrigation etc. undertaken by the concerned departments of the Ministry of Food & Agriculture, will be coordinated and integrated to make them mutually reinforcing.
"
2185,"3. In order to increase agricultural production, it is necessary to make available adequately the numerous services and facilities such as improved seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, tools and implements to the programmes of the various agencies such as the Agriculture Development Bank, the Agriculture Supply Corporation, the Land Reform Savings  Corporation, and the Cooperative Department will be operated in an integrated way.
"
2186,"4. Since it has become essential to consider measures to solve the problems of marketing,    the agricultural development programme will attempt to develop marketing channels through the reorganized cooperatives.
"
2187,"5. Extensive feasibility studies are required if the goals of promoting agro-based industries and diversifying agriculture are to be achieved.
"
2188,"Arrangement will be made to provide the credit and technical assistance required to the landlords for the establishment of these industries.
"
2189,"Similarly, appropriate programmes will be implemented to increase production of food grains, fruits, vegetables, milk, and other livestock.
"
2190,"6. There are indications that the Terai will face decreasing prices for its grain exports to India. Efforts are urgently required to increase future exports of the Terai surplus to countries other than India.
"
2191,"The market should also be extended towards the hills.
"
2192,"This is possible only if the purchasing power of the hill people is increased.
"
2193,"For these reasons, the policy is to invest in the hills according to the potentially of agricultural development.
"
2194,"In addition, attention will be given to projects which have already been built but are not operating.
"
2195,"One of the overriding principles in drawing up the programme is the determination of what can be done to maximize the use of present projects, ensuring at same time a logical linking of both the continuing and new projects.
"
2196,"Agriculture Development Programme in the Fourth Plan
"
2197,"It is necessary to increase the output of cereal and cash crops, as much as possible, to  attain the objectives of agricultural development under the Fourth Plan.
"
2198,"In addition, the production of fruits, vegetables, meat, milk and eggs has to be increased in order to augment the supply of nutritious food. Keeping this in view, targets of different agricultural products, along with the necessary supply of inputs and departmental programmes, have been fixed for the Plan period and are described below:
"
2199,"1. Cereal Grain:
"
2200,"During the Fourth Plan period, the population of Nepal is projected to increase at the rate  of 1.95 per cent per annum. Thus, to meet the increased demands of food grains caused by increase in population and income and in view of the fact that production of cereal grain increased by only 2.5 per cent per annum during the Third Plan period, it is envisaged in the Fourth Plan to increase the production of cereal grains by 16 per cent.
"
2201,"Accordingly, the average annual increase in production will be 3 per cent.
"
2202,"It is estimated that the annual increase in the production of paddy, maize and wheat will be 2 per cent, 1.3 per cent and 14.4 per cent respectively.
"
2203,"This target is based upon past progress and future programmes to be implemented during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2204,"In order to fulfill the target of cereal grain production, efforts will be concentrated on the provision of seeds, fertilizers, irrigation facilities, and agricultural extension to those districts selected on the basis of priority.
"
2205,"The selection of districts for the intensive Agriculture Development Programme is based on the following factors:
"
2206,"(a) The availability of irrigation and transport facilities; (b) Provision of organizational units concerned with agriculture development; (c) Potentially of agricultural development;
"
2207,"(d) Regional development; and (e) Facilities of government offices. Districts selected for Intensive Agricultural Development Programme are as follows:
"
2208,"a. Improved Seeds:
"
2209,"Since improved seeds play an important role increasing agricultural production, it is estimated that their use will contribute to 22 per cent of the increase in the total production.
"
2210,"It is estimated that in the last year of the Plan 25,020 metric tons of seeds will be provided for 472,000 hectares of land.
"
2211,"A breakdown of this programme is given in Table 23.
"
2212,"The necessary arrangements for increasing the supply of improved seeds should be made from the beginning of the Fourth Plan period.
"
2213,"The major responsibility for this will lie with the Agriculture Education and Research Department, the Agri-Extension Department, and the Agriculture Supply Corporation.
"
2214,"Foundation seeds which are discovered to be suitable for food grain production from research work undertaken by the agriculture stations of the Agriculture Education and Research Department and located in different parts of the country will be multiplied at government farms and made available to registered seed growers.
"
2215,"The seed growers will grow the improved seeds under the direction and technical assistance of the Agriculture Education and Research Department.
"
2216,"The Agriculture Supply Corporation will purchase and sell these certified seeds inside the country and import the necessary amount of seeds to meet the requirements fixed under the agriculture extension programme.
"
2217,"Only a portion of the total amount of improved seeds required to meet the target will be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation.
"
2218,"A major portion of the required improved seeds is expected to be provided by the farmers themselves.
"
2219,"To accomplish this, it is necessary to make the agriculture extension programme more effective.
"
2220,"The quantity of seeds to be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation is given in the Table 24.
"
2221,"More than 33 per cent of increased production during the Fourth Plan period is expected to be achie ved by the use of chemical fertilizer will be used for different crops in the last year of the Third Plan period. Those areas where irrigation available and where improved seeds are being used will be given top priority for use of fertilizer.
"
2222,"Moreover, information about the use of the new types of chemical fertilizer will be provided to the farmers by the Department of Agriculture Extension.
"
2223,"The annual quantities of chemical fertilizer used for different crops during the Plan period are given in the following Table: c. Irrigation:
"
2224,"In accordance with the target of food grain production in the Fourth Plan, it is estimated that additional 246,000 hectares of land will require irrigation facilities.
"
2225,"It will contribute more than 17 per cent to the increased production.
"
2226,"During the Plan period 183,632 hectares of cultivated land will be irrigated by major, tube-well, and minor irrigation projects. Details about the various irrigation projects included in the Fourth Plan are given under the chapter on the Irrigation Programme
"
2227,"d. Plant Protection Services: Approximately 16 per cent of the total annual agricultural production is estimated to be destroyed by diseases, insects and pests.
"
2228,"It is thus evident that if the plant protection programme is implemented more effectively, agricultural production can be easily raised. So far, it has been possible to provide the necessary facilities to limited areas only because of lack of the necessary technicians and materials.
"
2229,"Such services are expected to contribute about 14 per cent to increased production in the Fourth Plan period.
"
2230,"This programme will include the training of farmers regarding plant protection, the distribution of necessary materials including polythene bags and pesticides at low prices, and the provision of emergency plant protection services.
"
2231,"Since it is not possible to supply pesticides solely through the government, the private sector will also be encouraged in this field and will be provided with the necessary technical and other assistance.
"
2232,"It is estimated that plant protection materials worth 5.4 million rupees will be used during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2233,"Out of this, materials worth 3.9 million rupees will be supplied by the Agriculture Supply Corporation.
"
2234,"e. Agricultural Tools and Implements: Due attention has been given to the use of improved agricultural and implements under the agriculture development programme of the Fourth Plan.
"
2235,"The major portion of the demand for such materials is expected to be supplied by the existing Agriculture Tools and Implements Factory at Birgunj.
"
2236,"The Corporation will sell agriculture tools and implements worth Rs 7.3 million during the Plan period. f. Reclamation of additional cultivable land:
"
2237,"To achieve the agricultural production target of the Fourth Plan, 25,000 hectares of additional land will be reclaimed, out of which 21,000 hectares will be brought under cultivation.
"
2238,"Adaptive research on the use of different inputs (i.e. improved seeds, fertilizers, tools and implements and irrigation etc.) plays an important role in achieving the targeted increase in the production of cereal crops.
"
2239,"Research work is also essential to sustain the increase in production by solving any problem arising from the use of improved methods and inputs.
"
2240,"In view of this, details about research on cereal crops to be undertaken during the Plan period are included in the Chapter on Agriculture Education and Research Programme.
"
2241,"In view of the requirements of the existing agro-industries (viz. sugar, cigarettes and jute) and level of exports during the Third Plan, it is expected that the production of cash crops will increase by 40.3 per cent during the Fourth Plan.
"
2242,"Accordingly, the production targets of sugarcane, jute, tobacco and oilseeds have given in the following Table.
"
2243,"Surveys of areas suitable for the cultivation of cotton will be completed, along with the experimental research work to be undertaken in the Government Agriculture Stations.
"
2244,"As in the case of the food grain programme, arrangements for the provision of loans for the cash crop development programme will be taken care of by the concerned organization.
"
2245,"It will be difficult to enlist the interest and cooperation of the farmers in this programme because of its newness.
"
2246,"The targets, have been made practical.
"
2247,"The details of the cash crop programme are given in the following Table:
"
2248,"Research on Cash Crops
"
2249,"Practical research work on cash crops is in the preliminary stage. It has, therefore, become necessary to pay greater attention to it.
"
2250,"In the Fourth Plan Period, practical research work will be undertaken at the Agriculture Stations of Parwanipur, Tarhara, Bhairahawa, Janakpur and Rapti in order to introduce improved seeds and to identify improved methods of production.
"
2251,"Under this programme, it is also proposed to produce those improved seeds which have been found suitable by research work and to distribute them to the farmers.
"
2252,"The details of this are included in the programmes of Agriculture Education and Research.
"
2253,"Livestock Development
"
2254,"There is ample scope for livestock development in a mountainous country like Nepal.
"
2255,"In addition, livestock products like meat, eggs and milk are considered to be important for nutritive diets.
"
2256,"So far, the per capita consumption of these commodities is very low. We also must import these items.
"
2257,"So it is, therefore, essential to pay attention to the development of livestock. In the Fourth Plan, emphasis is given to the implementation of livestock development programme in those districts where
"
2258,"Livestock farms and other services are available. It is envisaged in the Plan to increase the production of meat, milk and eggs by 16 per cent, 23 per cent and 26 per cent respectively.
"
2259,"The following Table shows the production targets: -
"
2260,"Since all the slaughter animals required to fulfill the target will not be available internally from the natural increase in the country-animal stock (even including the increase due to the livestock development and improved cattle breeding programme) the shortage will be met by imports.
"
2261,"Pasture Development Programme
"
2262,"No programme for the supply of balanced feed and the arrangement of pasture for livestock have yet not been implemented in Nepal.
"
2263,"For the expansion of improved animal husbandry, it is necessary to make additional arrangements for pasture.
"
2264,"In the northern region of the country, traditional animal husbandry is deteriorating because of the lack of pastures.
"
2265,"It has, therefore, become necessary to develop pastures in this region.
"
2266,"In view of these factors, pasture development centers will be established in Lalitpur, Rasuwa, Ramechhap, Rapti, Sunsari and Jumla in order to undertake research and experimentation with improved grasses and to produce and distribute the seeds.
"
2267,"The seeds of improved grasses will be imported and experimented at these centers. The seeds found to be suitable will be produced and made available to the farmers.
"
2268,"Balanced Feed A programme for making available qualitatively improved and balanced feed is also included in the Fourth Plan.
"
2269,"At present the only food producing center is in Hetauda.
"
2270,"It is envisaged in the Fourth Plan to establish four additional centers in the private sector.
"
2271,"Production of each of these center is projected in the following Table:
"
2272,"Artificial Insemination
"
2273,"In the field of livestock development, it has been difficult to make available improved bullocks and buffaloes in the adequate numbers for the purpose of breeding. It has become necessary, therefore, to implement an artificial insemination programme.
"
2274,"This programme will help to increase the production of milk and other livestock products from the local breed.
"
2275,"At present, facilities for artificial insemination have been made available at the existing seven centers and four sub-centres located in different parts of the country.
"
2276,"It is expected that 198,000 cows and buffaloes will be artificially inseminated. Veterinary Services The availability of veterinary services is essential for the protection of livestock.
"
2277,"At present, there are 34 veterinary hospitals in the country.
"
2278,"Seven new hospitals will be established specially in those districts where the livestock development programme is to be implemented. Existing Veterinary Hospitals are at present located in the following places: Kathmandu 	Birgunj 	Ilam
"
2279,"Surveys of animal diseases will also be conducted.
"
2280,"The production of vaccines in the laboratory at Kathmandu will be expanded in hopes of gaining control of different types of diseases.
"
2281,"Research and Training on Livestock Development
"
2282,"Four multipurpose livestock development farms have been set up at lalitpur, chitwan, Sunsari and Kaski districts in order to conduct adaptive research on livestock farming to make available to the farms those improved animal breeds found suitable after research, and to provide practical training on animal husbandry.
"
2283,"In addition, sheep breeding farms have been established at Chitlang, Panchasaya knola and Jumla.
"
2284,"The goal of improving local breeds has been partially met by the improved livestock produced on these farms.
"
2285,"In order to implement this programme more extensively, livestock development farms will be established at Nepalgunj and Taplejung during the Plan period.
"
2286,"In addition, arrangement will be made on the Farms to provide training to the farmers regarding livestock development.
"
2287,"The projected production of livestock on these Government farms during the Plan period is shown in the following Table.
"
2288,"Poultry Farming
"
2289,"Keeping in view the important role of poultry farming in the field of livestock development, a programme for the production and sale of improved breeds of chicken has been implemented.
"
2290,"In the last few years encouraging progress has been made by the private sector in poultry farming especially in Kathmandu. At present, 100,000 chickens of the new improved breed are produced every year in the three existing hatcheries located at Parwanipur, Jawalakhel and Biratnagar.
"
2291,"It is estimated that the two privately owned hatcheries produce 100,000 chickens annually.
"
2292,"In order to fulfil the targets for poultry meat and eggs, three brooder units will be established at Pokhara, Nepalgunj and Bhairahwa during the Plan period.
"
2293,"As the target can not be fulfilled by the Government sector alone, further contributions in this field are needed from the private sector.
"
2294,"Hence, five hatcheries, each with an annual production capacity of 100,000 chickens should be established in the private sector.
"
2295,"The number of chickens to be produced and distributed from both the government and private hatcheries during the Plan period is shown in the following Table:
"
2296,"It is evident that programmes such as artificial insemination, pasture development and production of improved food, as mentioned above, will help to fulful the Fourth Plan’s target of milk production.
"
2297,"Moreover, it is expected that milk production will increase as a result of the assured market provided bythe Dairy Development Corporation which was established to prodec commercially pasteurized milk and milk– products.
"
2298,"The production targets of processed milk, cheese and other milk products will be fulfilled mainly from this Corporation and its centers that will be established during the Plan period.
"
2299,"The programme of the Dairy Development Corporation are as follows:
"
2300,"(i) Urban Milk Supply Project
"
2301,"At present, a central dairy with a capacity of 1.2 million litres has been established inKathmandu. It collects, processes, preserves and distributes milk and milk-products in a modern way.
"
2302,"Keeping in view the increasing demand for milk, the capacity of this dairy will be increased to 3 million litres during the Plan period.
"
2303,"In addition, since it has become necessary to provide pasteurized milk in other urban areas of the country, a programme for establishing dairies at Biratnagar, Nepalgunj and Birgunj is also included in the Fourth Plan.
"
2304,"The projected annual production of pasteurized milk during the Plan period is shown in the following Table:
"
2305,"(ii) Production and Sale of Cheese there is ample scope for producing milk-products in the northern region of Nepal where animal husbandry is the main occupation of the people.
"
2306,"It is estimated that the production of cheese from these factories was approximately 20 metric ton in 1969/70. during the Fourth Plan period, five new factories will be established in different parts of the country.
"
2307,"It is estimated that 50 metric tons of cheese will be produced from these factories by the end of the Plan period.
"
2308,"(iii) Butter producing Centre
"
2309,"It is estimated that 19 metric tons of butter were produced in 1969/70 by the Dairy Development Corporation.
"
2310,"During the Plan period, two butter producing centers will be established in the area of greatest potentiality in the country.
"
2311,"Carcass Utilization Project
"
2312,"According to the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the United Nations, this project is being implemented at Hetauda.
"
2313,"This project will be helpful in the utilization of carcasses which would otherwise have been wasted.
"
2314,"It will also include training in order to improve the quality of raw materials needed for the leather industry. Raw materials needed for such industries will be flayed and cured, thereby helping to increase the income of people involved in this kind of work.
"
2315,"When exported to foreign countries, leather processed in a scientific way will fetch maximum prices.
"
2316,"Products to be made available from this project will include some nutritious materials necessary for animal feed (like meat-cum-bone meal, meat-meal, bone-meal, technical fate) and horn and hoof meal fertilizer, bone-meal fertilizer, compost manure, hoof needle oil, leather etc. since the dead bodies will be collected as soon as possible the possibilities of spreading diseases to men and livestock will be reduced. Fisheries Development
"
2317,"Since there is a suitable climate and an adequate quantity of water in the different lakes and rivers of Nepal, it has become essential to pay attention to the development of fisheries in hopes of making available an essential nutritive diet for the increasing population.
"
2318,"It is, however, estimated that additional fish production was approximately 560 metric tons in the fiscal year 1969/70.
"
2319,"On the basis of this estimate and considering the possible programmes which can be implemented during the Fourth
"
2320,"Plan it is envisaged to increase additional fish production from 560 metric tons to 2000 metric tons by 1974-75.
"
2321,"According to this estimate, the quantity of fish to be available from different sources is shown in the following Table:
"
2322,"In order to fulfil the estimated target of fish production, 4 million fingerlings will have to be sold in the year 1974/75. since it is not possible to produce the fingerlings from the Government Fishery Centres and Fish-farms alone, the private sector will be encouraged to produce more and will be provided with technical and other assistance.
"
2323,"The annual projected production of the Government Fish Centres and Farms during the Plan period is given in the following Table:
"
2324,"Fish breeding centers and commercial farms have been established in different pars of the country in order to breed native and foreign fishes (like carps, trouts, asala and mahasher) after the necessary survey and research is done in accordance with the climatic and geographinc conditions of the country.
"
2325,"During the Fourth Plan period, two new breeding centers and two large fish development centers will be established.
"
2326,"Horticulture Development It is essential to increase the production of fruits and vegetables in order to meet the growing internal demand for nutritious food and to possibly increase the volume of exports.
"
2327,"Since diverse climatic conditions are present in the country, there is ample opportunity to produce different potential for development in this field, the targets for the production of fruits, vegetables and potatoes during the Fourth Plan period have been fixed and are given in the following Table:
"
2328,"The requirements for those seeds and plant inputs necessary to fulfil the Plans production target for each crop have been estimated, and the programme for making such inputs available has been determined as follows:
"
2329,"The Nucleus Seed Production Programme will be implemented to meet this requirement.
"
2330,"Foundation seeds will be produced and made available from the Potato Development Centres under the Horticulture Department.
"
2331,"Fertilizers and other inputs required for this programme will be made available fro the Agricultural Supply Corporation.
"
2332,"It is expected that 12,500 metric tons of potato seeds will be produced by the third year of the Plan period.
"
2333,"Vegetable Seeds
"
2334,"In order to produce the additional 20 metric tons of vegetable seeds envisaged in the Plan, it will e necessary to cultivate vegetables on 40 hectares of land, assuming that 500 Kg. Will be produced per hectare.
"
2335,"A Nucleus Seed Production Programme will be implemented for this purpose as in the case of potato seeds production, and necessary technical and other assistance will be provided to the private sector.
"
2336,"Accordingly, the annual programme for cultivating vegetables both in the Hilly and Terai Regions is given in the following Table:
"
2337,"In order to augment horticulture production effectively and to develop it commercially a large scale horticulture development programme will be implemented in those places where transportation facilities are available.
"
2338,"Accordingly, two 40 hectare horticultural farms will be established along Prithivi Highway and Arniko Highway.
"
2339,"Similarly another horticulture farm covering an area of 120 hectares will be established along the Simra-Janakpur sector of Mahendra Highway.
"
2340,"Horticulture Research
"
2341,"At present, experimental research work aimed at increasing the production of fruits, potatoes and vegetables is being undertaken at horticultural stations located in different parts of the country.
"
2342,"Before the Third Plan, there were 16 such stations, including nurseries under the Department of Horticulture.
"
2343,"New stations will be established at Humla and Mustang district during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2344,"Emphasis in this research programme will be given to the fulfillment of the production targets of the Fourth Plan.
"
2345,"Since no programme has yet been implemented in the field of horticulture, research work will also be encouraged in this field at the existing stations.
"
2346,"Agricultural Education and Research
"
2347,"In order to ascertain the effects of the combined or individual use of various inputs (like improved seeds, fertilizers, implements, pesticides and irrigation) in increasing the output of important cereal and cash crops and also to determine their practical utility, research work has already been started in the agricultural stations and farms of the Department of Agricultural Education and Research located in different parts of the country.
"
2348,"The training programme for technicians required in the agricultural sector is also continuing.
"
2349,"Therefore, all research activities in all stations and farms will be carried out in an integrated way.
"
2350,"The programmes to be implemented by various actions are as follows:
"
2351,"(a) Agricultural Botany
"
2352,"In hopes of improving cereal crops such as paddy, wheat, corn, millet as well as other crops such as oil-seeds and pulses, the collection of improved seeds from both internal and external sources and the multiplication of those seeds found suitable after analysis and varietal test will be expanded.
"
2353,"At present, sample -analysis of seeds as required by the Agriculture supply corporation  and the district agricultural development programme are being undertaken at a Seed Testing Laboratory in Kathmandu.
"
2354,"Since the Centre is unable to provide the required facilities for testing seeds, additional laboratories will be established in the agricultural stations located at Parwanipur, Janakpur and Bhairahwa during the Plan period.
"
2355,"In addition, a seed multiplication and development project will be implemented with the joint collaboration of His Majesty’s Government, Nepal and the United Nations Special Fund.
"
2356,"Under this programme, a seed-processing center will be established at Hetauda and necessary technical services for the production of certified seeds will be provided to the farmers
"
2357,"(b) Agronomy In accordance with the Plan target, foundation seeds (including the imported varieties that are found suitable after botanical research and analysis) will be produced at various agricultural farms in the country.
"
2358,"In addition, experimental research work on the use of the new variety seeds, fertilizers, water and other inputs will be continued as in the past.
"
2359,"These foundation-seeds will be produced at the agricultural farms at Khumaltar, Doti, Nepalgunj and Janakpur and the agricultural stations at Rampur, Parwanipur, Tarahara and Bhairahwa. The projected production for each year of the Plan period is as given below in the Table.
"
2360,"In order to develop improved seeds suitable for the hilly regions, two agronomy farms, one in the eastern hills and the other in the western hills, will be established during the Plan period:
"
2361,"TABLE 42
"
2362,"(c) 	Agricultural Engineering The design and estimation of agricultural construction projects and research on improved agricultural tools and machines, including experimental works regarding irrigation channels, tubewells, drainage and water utilization, will be continued as in the past.
"
2363,"The necessary technical services will also be made available to the farmers.
"
2364,"The research programme in the field of entomology includes an extensive survey of insects and parasites, a collection and study of their life cycles, character and nature, the influence of weather, and the use of various pesticides and chemical control measures. On the basis of results obtained from research work, crop-protection measures will be made more effective.
"
2365,"Necessary technical help will be established at Rampur, Nepalgunj, Rajbiraj, Bhairahwa and Dahngarhi during the Plan period.
"
2366,"Specific research will be carried on regarding those insects which appear to be important from an industrial point of view: bees, silk-worms, etc. in addition, legal measures will be taken, and plant quarantine units will be established in order to check the entry of new pests and other disease-transmitting insects and to prevent the spread of pest within the country, thereby making the farmers more enthusiastic and responsive towards crop protection measures.
"
2367,"Plant Quarantine Check-Posts will be established at Tribhuwan Airport, Birgunj, Nepalgunj, Jogbani and Bhairahwa during the Plan period.
"
2368,"(e) 	Plant Pathology In order to control plant disease and to safeguard productions, plant pathological research will be conducted on both local and improved varieties of paddy, corn, wheat, citrus fruits, vegetables, potatoes, oranges, sugarcane, jute and tobacco.
"
2369,"Research, experimentations, and demonstration of the simple, economic, and effective measures to control plant diseases will be undertaken.
"
2370,"For this purpose, there is at present a laboratory at Khumaltar, and plant protection units have also been set-up at Ilam, Biratnager, Rapti and Dhaulagiri Zones during the Plan period. Because this programme is also related to entomology, both will be jointly implemented by all the plant protection units.
"
2371,"(f) Soil Science In order to ascertain the production potential of the soil, the initial necessary steps are the survey, analysis and classification of the different types of soil found in the country.
"
2372,"A central laboratory has been established for the analysis of various types of soil and their properties.
"
2373,"In the Plan period a soil survey of 3.427 million hectares, of land and a analysis of 40,000 samples of soil will be conducted.
"
2374,"Experimentation on the productivity differences of major crops like jute, maize and paddy, as a result of the application of different organic and chemical fertilizers with various types of soil and climatic conditions, will be conducted at different Agricultural Stations and Farms.
"
2375,"Also, HMG in a joint effort will consist of experiments on different crops and fertilizer use according to soil conditions, demonstrations of results in the farmers’ fields, and the establishment of a soil testing laboratory at Parwanipur.
"
2376,"In the second phase of the programme, two pilot projects will be scientifically implemented.
"
2377,"The different research projects outlined above have been implemented at the agricultural stations located at Bhairahwa, Rampur, Parawanipur and Tarahara.
"
2378,"The necessary administrative arrangements will be made at eh beginning of the Plan period to ensure better coordination between the different programmes.
"
2379,"The work to be done by the respective sections has already been outlined above. (h) Agricultural College
"
2380,"In order to fulfil the requirements for medium and other lower level technicians, an agricultural school was established in 1956. An Agricultural College was established in 1968, with the objective of domestically providing the training facilities for higher level technicians.
"
2381,"By the end of 1970, it is projected that 225 persons will be trained up to I.Sc. level, 25 persons up to B.Sc. level, 700 persons up to JTA levels, 340 J.T. As will be upgraded and field training will be provided to 500 persons.
"
2382,"Agriculture Extension
"
2383,"The Agriculture Extension Programme has been used as an important means of providing technical assistance and necessary knowledge to the farmers so that they could adopt improved modern agricultural techniques such as the applicable findings of different agricultural research activities.
"
2384,"The Extension Programme also involves the actual demonstration of results, farmers’ training programmes, and competition.
"
2385,"Under this programme, District Agricultural Development Offices manned with Agricultural Graduates have already been established in 43 distric ts, and in each of another 22 districts, there are two to four medium level Agricultural technicians.
"
2386,"So far, Agricultural Extension has been primarily limited to food crops.
"
2387,"It has, however, become necessary to pay attention to horticulture, fishery and livestock development projects in order to fulfil the Plan targets in these sectors.
"
2388,"To implement the Agricultural Extension Programme effectively during the Plan period, specialists in cereals, cash crops, livestock, and horticulture, will be made available to the District Agriculture Development Offices according to their agricultural development programmes.
"
2389,"Moreover,	the number of village-level extension workers will be increased technical assistance will be provided to them from the nearest Agriculture Centres and Agriculture Farms.
"
2390,"According to this policy, the District Agriculture Development Offices in 28 selected districts will be further strengthened in order to implement the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme.
"
2391,"In each of the above districts there will be a J.T.A for every three Panchayats, and one J.T. for 9 J.T.As, and one Graduate level agricultural technician for each District Agriculture Development Office.
"
2392,"In these 28 districts, each J.T.A. and J.T. will have the responsibility of conducting agricultural extension work in their respective panchayats, the names of which will be specifically stated.
"
2393,"If, after the requirements of the 28 districts are filled, there are any remaining J.T.As, J.T.s and Agricultural Graduates, they will be posted in the other 37 districts where Agricultural Development Offices have been established, including those 22 districts where only J.T.s have been deputed.
"
2394,"They will be distributed according to the Districts’ agricultural development programme. Since there is no arrangement in the central office to investigate and identify the problems and to evaluate the facts and figures of the reports received from the District Agriculture Development Offices, it is important to initiate this kind of work.
"
2395,"The Agriculture Extension Programmes’ training and demonstrations to be conducted
"
2396,"1. Method-Demonstration
"
2397,"The	objec	tive of the method-demonstration is to improve agricultural production by assembling the farmers of the region as a group in a co-operative farmer’s field in a pandhayat. They will be given instructions by the J.T.s. and J.T.As, who are working in the panchayats under the guidance of DADO’s on the use of scientific method in agriculture (such as plant protection measures, different chemicals and mechanical uses), the improved techniques of cultivation, the application of chemical fertilizers, green-manures, farm-yard manures and also the preparation and used of compost manures.
"
2398,"Instruction will be also given to the farmers regarding the methods of improved animal husbandry, poultry farming and fishing, the required balanced diet for them, and methods of protection against various diseases and other pests.
"
2399,"Each J.T.A. living in a panchayat will carry out method-demonstration; and in the 28 districts covered by the intensive agricultural development programme, at least one compulsory method-demonstration regarding paddy, wheat and maize crops, in each Panchayat, will be carried out every year.
"
2400,"In other districts, the method- demonstration on fruits, vegetables, animal husbandry, and fishing will also be carried out, according to the climate of the district.
"
2401,"2. Result-Demonstrating
"
2402,"To show and convince farmers directly about the importance and advantages of the findings of research and the improved methods of agriculture, result-demonstrations will be arranged.
"
2403,"Since the farmers are easily convinced of the value of new techniques used by others or heard about from others, they will be shown the effects of improved seeds, fertilizers, insecticides and pesticides on their own fields. This will prove to be very advantageous if adopted; therefore, great attention will be given to this faster and more effective programme.
"
2404,"While carrying out the result-demonstrations, the farmers should be convinced that improved seeds will produce more than the local ones. For this purpose, the improved seed varieties are to be sown along with the local ones.
"
2405,"Although there will be some farmers who are already convinced that increased production will result from the use of the improved varieties, it is necessary to show to them the quantitative differences by using a variety of (improved) seeds sown in different plots. The changes in output of a particular type of seeds due to differences in fertilizers in the area should also be included in the result-demonstrations.
"
2406,"These type of demonstrations will be carried out particularly on paddy, maize, wheat and cash crops. For demonstrations, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and variety seeds will be provided free of cost to the farmers.
"
2407,"J.T.As will perform in heir assigned areas: two to three result-demonstrations for paddy and wheat, three for maize in the hills, one each in the Terai, and two for cash crops.
"
2408,"3. Leader Farmer Training
"
2409,"J.T.As stationed in various villages are to teach new techniques and provide necessary knowledge to the farmers regarding the cultivation of better seeds, uses of fertilizers, pesticides, medicines, agricultural implements, and scientific methods for livestock rearing. They are also to select progressive farmers and conduct a ‘one to three day’ training course regarding paddy, wheat, maize, cash and other crops, Every J.T.A is to conduct, on average, five such training courses each year.
"
2410,"The necessary seeds, fertilizers, medicines, etc., will be provided free of charge to the J.T.As for these training programmes.
"
2411,"The target of providing training to at least ten Leader Farmers has been set.
"
2412,"4. Seasonal In- Service Training Provisions have been made to provide seasonal training to the J.T.As on such matters as new seeds, fertilizers, plant protection and other medicines  	recommended as useful by the research programme and also about new methods of horticulture, fishery and livestock rearing.
"
2413,"Such a programme is not to be longer than five days and should be arranged in each of the zones  by those related to or in the agricultural department.
"
2414,"Keeping the zones by those related to in possible to conduct this type of training programme in all of the districts, so efforts will be made to train a most five J.Ts. and J.T.As from the intensive districts.
"
2415,"The training programme will cost of two parts:
"
2416,"(a) Winter Season Training: The course will include audio-visual training and will cover all kinds of winter crops and fruits, taking place from Mid-September to Mid-Novemner.
"
2417,"(b) Summer Season Training: Training will be provided primarily in paddy, maize, other summer crops and fruits and fishing, taking place from Mid-February to Mid-Apil.
"
2418,"5. Farmers’ Day
"
2419,"A farmers’ Day will be arranged in order to teach progressive peasants about the research findings of the Government Agriculture Farms and Centres on improved seeds, fertilizers and manures, animals, birds and fruits.
"
2420,"This will be done so that the farmers can see the demonstrations with their own eyes.
"
2421,"It has been found that such Farmer’s Day have had significant influence upon the farmers, especially since it is not possible to have all the farmers in one place and since the number of Agricultural Farms and Centres is limited. Farmer’s Day will be held by transporting farmers to agricultural farms and centers from outlying districts.
"
2422,"Since the number of 100 progressive farmers from one district will be allowed to participate in Farmer’s Day may also be held on the farm of a progressive farmer within the district.
"
2423,"6. Agricultural Fair and Exhibition
"
2424,"The agricultural project’s model charts, posters, pictures, booklets, etc. are exhibited at the fair.
"
2425,"The main objective of the exhibition is to attract the attention and interest of the farmers and to encourage them to use the improved farming methods.
"
2426,"This is mainly to arouse enthusiasm and interest among the farmers.
"
2427,"(d) To raise social prestige and to create a feeling of satisfaction among the farmers by increasing their productivity.
"
2428,"To fulfil the above purposes, competition will be held on the district and national level for paddy, wheat and maize crops each year.
"
2429,"Competition among the Hill and Terai districts will be in those districts which have been progressive in the adoption of improved agricultural techniques. The selected districts will then compete between themselves, and those standing first, second and third will be awarded prizes accordingly.
"
2430,"At the district-level-competition, a minimum of ten farmers should participate. Before the contest, the selected districts of Hill and the Terai will be put into various groups of two or three according to the progress made in cereal crop development.
"
2431,"These groups will then compete (separating hill districts and the Terai districts) against one another. The Department will determine which districts stand first, second and third in a particular crop according to the records sent from the districts.
"
2432,"Nine members from both the Hills and the Terai will compete at the national level on paddy, wheat and maize.
"
2433,"The winning farmer will be recognized as the “largest cereal producer” at the national level and will be given letters of recognitions and certificates, as well as cash prizes.
"
2434,"8. Rural Youth Programme
"
2435,"The objective of the Rural Youth Programme is to convert rural youth between 10 and 21 years of age into literate and progressive farmers and to provide them with practical training in modern and improved methods of agriculture.
"
2436,"For this purpose, 4-H Clubs will be organized for rural youth, and training will be provided to them on improved cultivation, animal husbandry, home science and small scale industry, under the guidance of the J.T., J.T.A. and other adult leaders who have been trained result-demonstrations on paddy, wheat, maize and vegetable crops will be done at each club.
"
2437,"All the club members will, according to their training interest, capacity and condition, undertake an agricultural project, and with their own effort and funds proceed to complete their projects, thereby learning and earning at the same time.
"
2438,"They are also to engage in community service 4 -H activities, festivals, cultivation programmes; tours kitchen gardening, and other programmes.
"
2439,"9. Agriculture Information Programme
"
2440,"A programme for providing information to the maximum number of farmers on research findings and new techniques will be carried out. This will be done through the mediums of ratio broadcasting, documentary films, exhibitions, audio-visual aids, publication of books and booklets, and agricultural news written in a simple language.
"
2441,"Food Research
"
2442,"The food research programme is being implemented with the objectives of conducting research on the nutritious value of available food stuffs and the provision of technical assistance to make the necessary arrangements for maintaining regular standards and quality of food stuffs for export and domestic consumption.
"
2443,"A Food Research Laboratory has already been established for this purpose.
"
2444,"Research works in the laboratory will be conducted in an effective way during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2445,"In addition, research work will be undertaken regarding the production of nutritive food from industrial waste and the preservation of food.
"
2446,"A study survey on the nutritious elements of food will also be undertaken.
"
2447,"Resettlement Programme
"
2448,"There has been increasing population pressure on land, especially in the hilly regions of the country, as a result of natural increase and the lack of cultivable land, there has been a growing uncontrolled movement into the Terai forests because of malaria eradication.
"
2449,"Because of these factors, a resettlement programme has become essential. The problem of resettlement has become more complicated due to an increasing influx of Nepalese from outside, including the ex- servicemen.
"
2450,"In a view of this, a Resettlement Company was set up in the year 1964 in order to settle landless farmers and their families in a n organized and planned manner. So far, 2000 families have been settled on 5000 hectares of land at Nawalpur and Khajura.
"
2451,"A Resettlement Department has also been recently established, thereby making implementation of these programmes more extensive.
"
2452,"On the other hand, the resettlement of less then 200 families (including those who have encroached into the forest areas) will be undertaken by the Resettlement Department through the Zonal
"
2453,"Resettlement Committees.
"
2454,"It has already been mentioned that additional cultivated land will be a significant contribution to the achievement of the target of food grains production for the Fourth Plan.
"
2455,"It has  been envisage in the Plan to settle 8,000 families after reclaiming25,000 hectares of land.
"
2456,"The details of the resettlement programme to be implemented by the Nepal Resettlement Company and the Resettlement Department are given in the following two Tables:
"
2457,"Agri-Economic Research and Studies It has been difficult to formulate and properly implement policies and plans for agricultural development because of a lack of basic studies and research work.
"
2458,"At present, data on agricultural production and area under cultivation are available.
"
2459,"There is, however, a lack of data regarding capital formation in agriculture, wage rates of seasonal labour, the marketing of agricultural products, income elasticity of demand for food, input-output relationships in agriculture, the feasibility of agro-based industries, and evaluations on the impact of land reform, agricultural extension, agricultural education and research programmes.
"
2460,"Therefore, a programme for the collection of these data has been included in the Fourth Plan
"
2461,"It is evident that the achievement of the agricultural development programme targets depend primarily upon the efficiency of hundreds of thousands of farmers.
"
2462,"In order to enable the farmers to increase production and to adequately use modern agricultural inputs, it is urgently necessary to provide credit on easy terms.
"
2463,"At present, cooperative societies, Agricultural Development Bank, Savings Corporation and Ward Committees are supplying agricultural credit. There is, however, a lack of scientific organization, an inefficient administration with minimum direction and control and a lack of clearly defined fields of activity and responsibility.
"
2464,"This has, in turn, created obstacles in the provision of credit to farmers. Based upon actual experience gained so far the following arrangements will be made for the supply of credit, inputs, and marketing facilities in those districts where intensive agricultural development programme will be implemented during the Fourth Plan period:
"
2465,"1. Instead of establishing new organizations to supply institutional agricultural credit for inputs at the village level, the existing institutions will be strengthened, i.e., Cooperatives, the Agricultural Development Bank, the Land Reform Savings Corporation, and the Agriculture Supply Corporation and Ward Committees.
"
2466,"2. Village Committees will be entrusted with the collection of Compulsory Savings at the village level, the provision of individual agricultural credit, the sale of improved seeds, chemical fertilizers and other inputs in all 28 districts where the Intensive Agriculture Development Programme w ill be implemented.
"
2467,"All records of the financial transactions and marketing operations of Village Committees will be kept by the secretaries of the concerned Village Panchayats. The Land Reform Savings Corporation will depute 344 credit inspectors and establish 14 regional offices in order to supervise and guide the Village Committees.
"
2468,"When these Villages Committees are efficient enough to run on their own the Committees will be converted into Village Multipurpose Cooperative Societies, and the compulsory savings, subject to the approval of deposits, will be transformed into the share capital of the society.
"
2469,"Thus when the committees are converted into Multipurpose Cooperative Societies, the Cooperatives will be reorganized at the inter-village level in the following way. In the interim period, Village Committees with function only as agents of the Inter-Village Cooperative Organization and will sell agricultural inputs to the farmers of the village on the basis of a prescribed commission.
"
2470,"The Land Reform Savings Corporation will provide general agricultural production loans through village committees on commission as at present.
"
2471,"His Majesty’s Government will provide grants to the Land Reform Savings Corporation for the administrative expenses of Credit Inspectors who will be supervising Village Committees. 3. The Department of Cooperatives will establish up to 10 inter-village cooperative organizations after reorganizing in stages the existing cooperatives in the 28 intensive districts.
"
2472,"The Cooperative Institutions, thus resources-organized, will receive guidance and administrative support from the Agricultural Development Bank.
"
2473,"During the plan period, the Department will set up offices in those districts with cooperative institutions and will provide facilities for supervision and audit.
"
2474,"Trained persons will be posted by the Agricultural Development Bank in such institutions to work as managers of the cooperative organizations, His Majesty’s Government will provide grants to the Agricultural Development Bank	to cover the administrative expenses of such persons.
"
2475,"The cooperative institutions organized at the inter- village level will proved credit to their members, and acting as agent of the Agricultural Supply Corporation, they will supply agricultural inputs through the Village Committees and undertake the marketing of agriculture products of the concerned village panchayats.
"
2476,"4. At the district level, the Agriculture Development Bank will establish branches for the overall supervision of financial transactions and the provision of individual loans to farmers for larger undertakings.
"
2477,"Similarly, the Agriculture Supply Corporation will establish its offices at the district level in order to provide agricultural inputs and marketing facilities. At the village level, the resources-organized cooperative organizations, acting as agents of the corporation, will undertake the marketing of these inputs.
"
2478,"5. In the districts where the Intensive Agriculture Development Programme will not be implemented, the programme in this field will continue as in the past.
"
2479,"The cooperative system was introduced in the country during the first Plan period. The increased number of societies indicates that there has been remarkable progress in this field.
"
2480,"During the 12 year period the number of cooperatives has increased to about 1,300. these cooperatives were not developed merely by those people who accept the principles and ideal of the cooperative movement.
"
2481,"They were formed primarily by the Department of cooperatives with the government grants.
"
2482,"Therefore, the existing cooperatives lack sufficient funds, members, knowledge, and efficiency of management. Hence, it was natural that these fast growing cooperatives would not have the anticipated qualitative development.
"
2483,"Out of the 1,300 existing cooperative societies, about two third of the 1,100 concerned with agriculture are ineffective and are in the process of liquidation.
"
2484,"Of the rest, some need promotional measures, whereas, others need to be amalgamated. Therefore, it is envisaged in the Fourth Plan to resources-organize the existing societies, and to concentrate on quality rather then quantity
"
2485,"Programme in the Fourth Plan
"
2486,"In view of the lack of technical personnel, resources, and managerial skill at the Village level, it  is impracticable to establish cooperative societies simultaneously throughout the country. It is, therefore, envisaged in the Fourth Plan to establish up to 10 well-organized societies after reorganizing and amalgamating the existing cooperatives in each of the 28 intensive districts.
"
2487,"Since each society thus established will cover more then one village, they will be called inter-village cooperative societies. As stated above, the management of these societies will be supervised for the required period of time.
"
2488,"These societies will concentrate their activities primarily on the provision of credit to the member farmers, the supply of agricultural inputs through village committees, and the marketing of agricultural products in an organized way so that the farmers can get proper remuneration for their labour.
"
2489,"When the village committees are converted into village multipurpose cooperative societies, they will then become members of the inter-village cooperative organization.
"
2490,"When cooperatives at the village level are functioning smoothly and effectively, inter-village cooperatives will be amalgamated, and then only one organization will be constituted at the district level.
"
2491,"In the first year of the Fourth Plan, at least two inter-village cooperative organizations will be established by the amalgamation or resources-organization of the existing societies in the 28 intensive districts.
"
2492,"Cooperative societies thus resources-organized will be established in each district as required by the end of the Plan period. Although cooperatives have been introduced in 56 districts of the country, the Fourth Plan gives priority to the 28 districts, where the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme will be implemented.
"
2493,"They will be strengthened by providing trained personnel, such as cooperative inspectors, accountants, and others. In the Central Office, the audit section will be made more effective and efficient.
"
2494,"In addition, a separate section to deal with agricultural production is not marketed in accordance with cooperative principles and the farmers are not guaranteed fair prices, agricultural production is likely to be adversely affected.
"
2495,"Theoretical and practical training of 3 to 6 months duration and a short-term in-service training programme will be continued by the Cooperative Training Centre for departmental personnel and managers of cooperative societies.
"
2496,"Moreover, mobile training teams for the districts will provide short- term practical training to the members and staff of the cooperative organizations. B.
"
2497,"Agriculture Supply Corporation Among the inputs required to achieve the targets of the Fourth Plan, chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, pesticides, and improved implements will be supplied mainly by the Agriculture Supply Corporation.
"
2498,"The amount of different inputs to be sold during the Plan period by the Corporation is given in the following Table:
"
2499,"At present, the Agriculture Supply Corporation has its central office at Kathmandu with six branches in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Janakpur, Biratnagar, Bhairahwa and Nepalgunj; nine depots in Chituwan, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Saptari, Sirha, Jhapa, Taulihawa, phokara and Bardia and four seasonal supply centers in Parasi, Dang, Kailali and Palpa.
"
2500,"During the Fourth Plan period, saled depts. Will be established in all 28 districts where the Intensive Agricultural Development programme will be implemented.
"
2501,"These depots will provide the necessary agricultural inputs and supply the chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, polythene bags, to the iner-village cooperative organizations and village committees.
"
2502,"Warehouses
"
2503,"Warehouses are under construction in Kathmandu and Birgunj to cope with the increasing volume of trade.
"
2504,"During the Third Plan period, with the completion of warehouses for fertilizers and seeds, the corporation will have warehouses with a capacity of 2,500 M.T. 2,000 M.T. and 1,000 M.T. respectively at Birgunj, Kathmandu and Bhairahawa.
"
2505,"During the Fourth Plan Period warhouses will be constructed as need in the 28 districts where the Intensive Agricultural Development Programme will be implemented.
"
2506,"The expenditure required to implement the above mentioned programmes is given in the following Table: required to implement the above mentioned programmes, the entire expenditure for warehouses and 50 percent of administrative expenditures will be borne by His Majesty’s Government. The financing required for the inputs will be met by internal sources and by loans from the Savings Corporation.
"
2507,"It is evident that the foreign exchange facilities required for this purpose will be made available by His Majesty’s Government.
"
2508,"Warehouses and Marketing
"
2509,"Because there is no institutional organization for marketing and storing agricultural products, the actual farmer does not receive proper remuneration for his labour.
"
2510,"With no facilities for storage, they are compelled to sell their products even when the prices are low.
"
2511,"If essential marketing facilities are not provided, farmers cannot be induced to produce more.
"
2512,"This is demonstrated by the increase production of wheat.
"
2513,"In view of changes in the traditional export markets of food grains, it is necessary in Kathmandu valley to pay timely attention to exploring alternate markets elsewhere. Otherwise, it is possible that the target for increased production will be difficult to attain as a result of the lack of markets and decreased prices.
"
2514,"A will organized Marketing and Warehousing Corporation will, therefore, be established for this purpose during the Fourth Plan period.
"
2515,"In the preliminary stage, this corporation will expand the external market of agricultural products and provide facilities to the farmers for storage over given period of time.
"
2516,"On the basis of agricultural products stored, farmers could get required credit from the Agricultural Development Bank, the Land Reform Savings Corporation or any other financial institution, and they could sell their products when market conditions become favourable.
"
2517,"Since most of the improved seeds required during the Plan period will be produced by the farmers themselves, storage facilities can be provided to such farmers by the proposed Corporation.
"
2518,"Rupees 7.8 million in the form of share capital of His Majesty’s Government has been allocated for this corporation in the Fourth Plan.
"
2519,"If additional resources are required, requirements for share capital will be made available from Nepal Rastra Bank, Agriculture Development Bank, Land Reform Savings Corporation and other financial institutions.
"
2520,"From the very beginning, the Corporation will construct warehouses from available resources at appropriate places in the country for its own use and the use of farmers.
"
2521,"Agricultural Credit
"
2522,"In order to achieve the targets of the Fourth Plan, agricultural credit of 220 million rupees over  that which is mobilized in the private sector will be needed for the provision of various inputs, such as chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, plants and seeds and other inputs for horticulture development, chicken, fingerlings and improved livestock for poultry, fisheries and livestock development.
"
2523,"The Agricultural Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation are the main sources of agricultural credit and can provide credit worth 475.1 million rupees during the Plan period.
"
2524,"Therefore, long-term credit worth Rs 250 million can be made available to augment capital expenditure on implements, storage and minor irrigation projects for agricultural development in the private sector.
"
2525,"Short term agricultural credit will be provided to the farmers in the intensive districts by the Land Reform Savings Corporation through the district offices and ward committees.
"
2526,"Similarly, the Agricultural Development Bank will provide small loans to member farmers through cooperative Organizations and large scale credit for specific purposes directly through its district offices.
"
2527,"The above Table shows that the Agricultural Development Bank has, on average, supplied annually more then Rs 5.8 million  	of credit for various purposes.
"
2528,"The Land Reform Savings Corporation has supplied about 10.0 million rupees.
"
2529,"During the Fourth Plan period, more then Rs 470 million of credit will be provided by the Agriculture Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation.
"
2530,"Annual details are given below:
"
2531,"In order to achieve the approved agricultural targets of the Fourth Plan, the Agricultural Development Bank and the Land Reform Savings Corporation will provide credit on the basis of the annual programme through the concerned organizations or committees, as required for cereal crops, cash crops, horticulture, livestock and poultry and fisheries development.
"
2532,"His Majesty's Government will provide grants amounting to 10 million rupees for the personnel expensed to the Agricultural Development Bank in order to operate the inter-village cooperative organizations and to the Land Reform Savings Corporation in order to supervise the Village Committees.
"
2533,"The estimated outlay required for implementing the above mentioned programme regarding agricultural credit, inputs and marketing during the Fourth Plan period, is as follows:-
"
2534,"CHAPTER VII
"
2535,"IRRIGATION
"
2536,"The water resources of the country are adequate for the development of irrigation facilities. The three major river systems are Kosi, Narayani and Karnali.
"
2537,"Before crossing the border they drain a total area of 141,190 sq. Kilometres or 83 per cent of the total catchments area of all the river systems of the country.
"
2538,"These three rivers have their head waters in the main Himalayan range, and are perennial due to glacial origin. The minimum discharge of each river is 214 cubic meter pe r second, even during dry winter season.
"
2539,"Besides the watersheds of these river system there are seven big rivers draining catchments between 1280 sq. k.m. and 6400 sq.
"
2540,"These rivers are, from west to east- Sharada, Babai, Rapti, Bagmati, Kamala, Kankai and Mechi.
"
2541,"These rivers are also perennial since the source of these rivers is either in the Himalayan or Hahabharat ranges.
"
2542,"In addition, there are several small streams which have their origin in the Chure hill.
"
2543,"Objectives, Policies and Priorities of Irrigation Development in the Fourth Plan Objectives
"
2544,"The irrigation programme in the Fourth Plan is formulated to reach the following objectives:
"
2545,"(a) To provide irrigation facilities as required for the agricultural development projects; (b) To gradually reduce dependence on uncertain monsoon and thereby increase agricultural production by creating opportunities for growing more than one crop
"
2546,"Policy and Priority
"
2547,"In accordance with the above objectives the following policies and priorities are adopted for the Plan period: 1.
"
2548,"During the past few years special attention was given to the development of minor irrigation projects. Therefore, medium and major irrigation projects were not given proper attention.
"
2549,"Since a considerable part of the irrigation facilities provided so far have been minor projects, it is evident that such projects are not suitable for meeting long-term irrigation requirements. Since construction of major irrigation projectors depends upon external aid, the timely development of irrigation potential
"
2550,"2. There are some projects which have been started but not completed during the Third Plan, but will be completed in the Fourth Plan.
"
2551,"Two of these projects are the Gandak and Chatra canals which are being constructed directly by the Indian Government and will be completed and made available during the Plan period.
"
2552,"3. In order to utilize ground water, tube-well projects also will be implemented as required. Feasible minor irrigation projects will also be implemented during this Plan period.
"
2553,"4. Along with the constructions of continuing and newly proposed projects, feasibility studies of various projects will be undertaken in order to prepare future plans.
"
2554,"At the same time, renovation and extension of old projects will be continued. River control and reclamation projects will also be implemented to prevent losses during the rainy season.
"
2555,"5. Since there is no water management code for effective use and protection of water resources available in the country, necessary steps will be taken in the Fourth Plan period to institute an appropriate water management programme designed to ensure the efficient construction, maintenance and operation of irrigation dams, canals and distributories. Permanent arrangement will be made with necessary coordination between the Departments of Agriculture and Irrigation.
"
2556,"6. Although all activities concerning irrigation were being carried out by one department until very recently, two separate departments-Minor Irrigation Department and Irrigation Department have been established. This has greatly increased administrative expenses, added to the problem of coordination, and caused confusion in deciding the function of each department.
"
2557,"Irrigation Development Programme in the Fourth Plan
"
2558,"The irrigation programme in the Fourth Plan has been determined in accordance with the priority of irrigation policy and the targets of agricultural production.
"
2559,"Accordingly, irrigation facilities will be provided to 183,632 hectares of land during the Plan period.
"
2560,"Detailed programmes are given below:
"
2561,"(a) Major Irrigation Programme
"
2562,"Since all projects cannot be completed within the Plan period, only 146,700 hectares of land will be provided with irrigation facilities by the end of the Plan.
"
2563,"1. Sharada Irrigation Project
"
2564,"Having constructed a weir near Mahendranagar in Kanchanpur district, the Indian Government is already utilizing water from the Mahakali river (which is called Sharad in India) for production of power and irrigation.
"
2565,"Under provisions of the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Indian Government regarding this project, India has now agreed to supply 460cusecs of water for irrigation in Nepal.
"
2566,"This project is therefore, included in the Plan.
"
2567,"2. Kamala Irrigation Project
"
2568,"This project is expected to provide irrigation facilities to 28,000 hectares of Dhanusha and Sirha districts.
"
2569,"Although the project was started in 1961, no progress was made after completion of the right canal.
"
2570,"It is now envisaged in this Plan to start the construction work during the third year of the Fourth Plan.
"
2571,"Under this project it is proposed to construct a wier in the Kamala river near Chisapani village and to construct canals on both banks.
"
2572,"The cost of the project is estimated at Rs 5,50,00,000.
"
2573,"A feasibility report of this project has been completed.
"
2574,"3. Lohattar Irrigation Project
"
2575,"Lohattar is a tributary of the Rapti river in Narayani Zone. The project is expected to irrigate a total area of 12,000 hectares of land in the eastern part and a portion of the western part of Rapti
"
2576,"The project intends to utilize a total of 516 cusecs of water with the construction of head- works in the Sano-Rapti, Budi Rapti and Dungriya rivers, as well as the Lohattar.
"
2577,"A feasibility report of the project has been completed and its total cost is estimated to be Rs 2,97,50,000. the construction work of this project is expected to be completed in the last year of the plan.
"
2578,"4. Bagmati Irrigation Project
"
2579,"Bagmati is one of the main medium-sized rivers in Central Nepal.
"
2580,"This river is perennial, providing an assured supply of water which is essential for dependable farming.
"
2581,"A barrage will be constructed near Mangalpur, near the place where the Bagmati river flows into the Terai plain and passes through the Mahabharat and Chure ranges. The project aims to utilize 34.7 cubic metre water per second on each bank or a total of 69.4 cubic metre per second of water.
"
2582,"The total cost of this project is estimated to be Rs 15,00,000,000. the project feasibility report has been completed.
"
2583,"The project will be started in the last year of the Plan and 25 per cent of the construction work will be completed in the same year.
"
2584,"5. Patharaiya Irrigation Project
"
2585,"The purpose of this project is to provide irrigation water by constructing a weir in Patharaiya river at a site 72 k.m. north-east of Dhangarhi,.
"
2586,"The construction work of this project has been in progress since fiscal year 1969-70 and is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan.
"
2587,"8. Chapakot Tar Irrigation Project
"
2588,"Chapakot 	T	ar is in Syangja District of Gandaki Zone.
"
2589,"The project plan shows the construction of the diversion weir at Jyagdi River in Darsing village and a canal system on the left bank by which 80 cusecs of water will be supplied for the irrigation of 2,000 hectares of land.
"
2590,"In the absence of irrigation facilities, only maize and millet are grown in limited areas at the present time. Irrigation will make it possible to grow paddy, wheat and sugar-cane in the region.
"
2591,"Construction work of the project will be completed n the second year of the Plan.
"
2592,"9. Chaurjahri Tar Irrigation Project
"
2593,"This project is in Rukum district.
"
2594,"About 250 hectares of land will be irrigated after the completion of this project.
"
2595,"Estimated cost of the project is Rs 7,00,000.
"
2596,"Although projects in remote and inaccessible districts cost much more then in the Terai, they are vital in the development programmes of such districts.
"
2597,"In a remote district like Rukum, provision of irrigation facilities, even though in a small amount, would increase food production and help to solve the problem of food deficit.
"
2598,"The survey, design and cost estimate of the project have been already completed.
"
2599,"Construction work was started in 1969/70 and will be completed in the second year of the Plan. 10.
"
2600,"Renovation and Extension (including Chandra Canal)
"
2601,"Under this programme, the necessary renovation and extension of various irrigation projects already completed will be undertaken. This will ensure the more effective utilization of the irrigation potential of the projects and thereby provide additional benefits.
"
2602,"This programme mainly deals with the renovation of structures in the canal, and extension of the canal.
"
2603,"The project report for renovation of the Chandra canal is under preparation.
"
2604,"Similarly, other canals also will be renovated and extended as required. 11.
"
2605,"Flood Control and Reclamation
"
2606,"A major portion of rain in Nepal comes during the Monsoon within a short period of time.
"
2607,"Recognizing the urgent need for protection of land against such damages, this programme has been implemented from the year 1969/70.
"
2608,"Under this programme, necessary survey of the damages caused by such rivers in different parts f the country will be conducted and appropriate construction works will be 	u ndertaken.
"
2609,"This programme also includes the Likhu river control scheme which is a part of the follow-up works of the Trisuli Watershed Development Projects. 12.
"
2610,"Project Feasibility Studies
"
2611,"A survey of various rivers scattered around the country, determining their potentiality and feasibility for irrigation, is included in the annual programme every year.
"
2612,"The preliminary survey is followed by design and dost estimates for the feasible projects, followed by the preparation of the complete report of the proje ct.
"
2613,"The main purpose of this programme is to formulate sound irrigation projects based on the water resources of the country and to provide detailed information on the techno-economic aspects of any project before it is selected for implementation.
"
2614,"This will not only provide important data regarding the development of water resources, but will also be helpful in formulating feasible and practical projects.
"
2615,"Under this programme various model studies, laboratory test and other work which is impossible to do in Nepal will be completed by the foreign agencies and advisory services of the foreign experts.
"
2616,"Main studies under this programme are as follows:
"
2617,"(a) Sunkosi Terai Project
"
2618,"The principal objective of this project is to prepare a project report based upn feasibility studies on the Sunkosi River for the development of irrigation facilities in the central and eastern sectors of the Terai lying between the Kosi and Bagmati rivers.
"
2619,"The preliminary report states that the project is feasible and practical. Therefore, a detailed study is underway with the joint efforts of His Majesty's Government and the United Nations Development Programme / Special Fund.
"
2620,"It is assumed that the proposed project can be designed to generate 75,000 Kw.
"
2621,"Power and to irrigate about 1,00,000 hectares of land.
"
2622,"(b) Babai Irrigation Project
"
2623,"Babai is one of the main rivers in Bheri Zone.
"
2624,"According to the preliminary survey, it is estimated that the project can irrigate 9,100 hectares of land in Banke and Bardia districts.
"
2625,"During the Plan period, a feasibility study of this project will be completed, and the final report will be prepared. (c) Kankai Irrigation Project
"
2626,"Kankai is the main river in Mechi Zone.
"
2627,"According to the preliminary report, it is estimated that this river can be harnessed to irrigate 40,500 hectares on the west bank and 32,000 hectares on the east.
"
2628,"A feasibility study will be completed, and a detailed report will be prepared during the Plan period.
"
2629,"(d) 	Kanchandanawa Irrigation Project
"
2630,"The project is expected to irrigate 20,000 hectares of landing the Kapilvastu and Rupendehi districts in Lumbinin Zone.
"
2631,"The survey work is in progress, and a detailed report and study will be completed within the Plan period.
"
2632,"The Eastern Canal in Nepal separates from the Don branch canal of the Gandak Project will provide irrigation for 69,600 hectares of land in bara, Parsa and Rautahat districts.
"
2633,"A separate head-regulator is constructed in the main dam for this canal (which is different from the main western canal flowing to India).
"
2634,"The length of this canal will be 28.8 k.m. and can irrigate about 24,000 hectares of land in Nawalparasi district.
"
2635,"The project is expected to be completed in the second year of the Plan.
"
2636,"Tube-well irrigation projects have some special benefits of their own, and such projects are gaining in popularity.
"
2637,"Therefore, it has become necessary from economic and practical stand-points to utilize ground water as well as surface water for irrigation.
"
2638,"According to the programme, 250 tube -wells will be installed in Sagarmatha, Janakpur, Narayani and Lumbini zones.
"
2639,"Minor Irrigation Project
"
2640,"Since a detailed survey of all projects to be implemented during the Fourth Plan period has not been completed and no cost estimates for such projects have been made, it is envisaged to implement 182 projects throughout the 14 zones on the basis of toposheets and preliminary surveys.
"
2641,"The annual programme of minor irrigation will be determined in coordination with the Resettlement Programme.
"
2642,"Without this arrangement, irrigation projects will not serve their purpose. Irrigation Projects and their Outlay
"
2643,"Outlay on various irrigation projects to be implemented during the Fourth Plan period is given below: CHAPTER VIII
"
2644,"SURVEY, LAND REFORM AND LAND ADMINISTRATION The land reform programme must be effectively carried out in order to create the proper atmosphere of planned development and to establish a society free from exploitation, based upon class coordination as envisaged by the Panchayat System.
"
2645,"In the present situation, economic development cannot be generated without substantially changing agriculture, and thereby raising the living standard of the tenants no basic change in agriculture can be attained unless the tenants share equitably in agricultural output. In fact, the objective of creating the necessary conditions for attaining a society free from exploitation may remain unfulfilled unless traditional exploitation based on land is eliminated.
"
2646,"Also, it is necessary to transfer inactive capital and under-employed labour from agriculture to industry or some other more productive sector of the economy. It is for these reasons that the current land reform programme will be implemented as a priority programme.
"
2647,"Unless the land reform programme is effectively and properly executed, other agricultural development programmes will not be effective. Therefore, the land reform programme will be emphasized by accelerating the work of survey and land administration.
"
2648,"The revenue survey is imperative in the establishment of some permanency in the land system and in the preparation of a register showing land-owners, tenants, and the kind of land. This information helps in the distribution of the permanent tenancy right certificates and land above ceiling.
"
2649,"Considering these facts, the objectives and policies of the Fourth Plan are formulated to keep in view the capacity and the desired changes in the directors of survey, land reform, and land administration.
"
2650,"Land (Administration) Offices in 13 districts were opened during the first four years of the Plan period as part of the programme to set up Lands Department in the center and Land (Administration) Offices in the districts.
"
2651,"Objectives in the Fourth Plan
"
2652,"The land reform programme, as a means to create a society free from exploitation and to increase agricultural production, will have the following objectives during the Plan period: a.
"
2653,"To effectively implement the Land Reform Programme and provide better incentives to the actual tillers;
"
2654,"b. To adequately provide agricultural credit, research, extension works and publicity, and other material and immaterial inputs, as well as to bring about a better coordination between land reforms and other related programmes; and
"
2655,"Revenue survey operations were not accelerated, and as a result, the distribution of permanent tenancy certificates and the appropriation and redistribution of land above prescribed ceilings have been delayed.
"
2656,"Difficulties have also been experienced in the debt-determination and debt-redemption programmes.
"
2657,"Because of the lack of proper coordination between the Land Reform and Agricultural Extension Programmes, there does not seem to have been any increase in agricultural productivity.
"
2658,"Policies of the Fourth Plan Considering the above mentioned objectives of the programmes, the difficulties encountered in the past, and the working capacity of the departments, the following targets have been fixed for the Fourth Plan:
"
2659,"1. Revenue surveys will be completed in 44 districts (including the 18 districts already completed), and work will be started in 4 more districts.
"
2660,"Trigonometrical and Topographical surveys will also be started in a few selected districts.
"
2661,"2. The distribution of Permanent Tenancy Certificates will be completed in 39 districts.
"
2662,"3. Land appropriation and redistribution programmes will be effectively implemented under ceiling provisions of the Land Act in this 39 districts.
"
2663,"4. Land (Administration) Offices will be established in these 39 districts, and the existing Land
"
2664,"5. Proper and permanent arrangements will be with respect to compulsory savings and their effective utilization.
"
2665,"6. rents will be fixed not to exceed 50 per cent of the main crop (or some other conducive figure) in 39 districts during the Plan period. This is being done as an incentive to farmers to grow more.
"
2666,"7. The determination and realization of agricultural credit will be accomplished in all Land Reform Districts.
"
2667,"8. Reforms will be made in the land tax system in order to impart greater social justice and to provide  an incentive for increased production.
"
2668,"9. To give effect to the land to the tiller programme and also help to mobilize men and capital from the agricultural to non-agricultural sector, the existing financial institutions will be made more effective in advancing loans to farmers, provided that the farmers are going to become owner-tillers and the original proprietors are investing their money (that they got from land sold) in particular industrial projects.
"
2669,"Such institutional credit will be provided only on the condition that real tenants will be the owner-tillers and that the land for sale will be used as security against loans advanced to the tillers whose liability to the lending corporation will be redeemed as they repay the loan in prescribed installments.
"
2670,"1. Survey Programme
"
2671,"a. Cadastral Survey
"
2672,"Revenue surveys help to levy a uniform land tax. They also pave the way for the appropriation and redistribution of land about the allowed ceiling to the landless tenants and the distribution of permanent tenancy certificates.
"
2673,"New equipment, such as orthophoto, telescopic alidade, stadia rod, etc., will be introduced to make the revenue surveys less expensive and faster during the Plan period.
"
2674,"The staff of the survey party team will be trained to use this new equipment.
"
2675,"Revenue surveys will be completed in an additional 26 districts or approximately 3,37,955 hectares of land, and will be started in 4 more districts during the Plan period.
"
2676,"A detailed programme is shown below:
"
2677,"b. 	Trigonometrical Survey
"
2678,"The trigonometrical survey team will establish three trigonometrical points in the areas where revenue surveys have been completed the trigonometrical points established by the Survey of India will be systematized.
"
2679,"Each “Amin” of the revenue survey party will have three trigonometrical points.
"
2680,"In the beginning period, arrangements will be made for the requisite number of trigonometrical points for 7 survey team parties.
"
2681,"The scale of the map will be uniform for all areas where the survey work has been completed.
"
2682,"There will be no overlapping of one area above the other when there are common borders.
"
2683,"It is estimated that the trigonometrical survey work will be completed for approximately 2,72,685 hectares of land during the Plan period. c. 	Maintenance Survey
"
2684,"The maintenance survey programme is important for the elimination of duplication in the completed revenue survey and for the updating of survey maps. One maintenance survey section will be established in each Land (Administration) Office. In order to keep registers up-to-date and to trace and properly care for survey maps.
"
2685,"New records will be entered in case borders are changed due to the purchase and sale of land or some other reason. The duplication of such maps will be sold and distributed.
"
2686,"Inspection works will be done for the maintenance of the trigonometrical points once they are fixed, and reports will have to be submitted when changes take place.
"
2687,"The plan envisage to establish maintenance survey sections in an additional 26 districts.
"
2688,"d. 	Topographical Survey
"
2689,"Topographical maps are required for the geological, soil and forest surveys.
"
2690,"We have to depend on others for these maps, even though the available copies are inadequate.
"
2691,"Besides, these maps are not according to our needs and the available copes are out-of-date.
"
2692,"His Majesty's Government of Nepal willendeavour to obtain United Nations Special Fund approval for setting up a topographical survey section during the Plan period.
"
2693,"It will be entrusted with the following tasks:
"
2694,"1. To complete the topographical survey works of the areas, other than those undertaken by the Geological Survey of India, and the publication of one inch map sheet.
"
2695,"2. To reproduce one inch map sheets of Nepal in the required quantity now being published by the Survey of India and to keep the sheets up-to-date.
"
2696,"3. To draw and publis h up-to-date small maps of Nepal, e.g. 1:250,000.
"
2697,"4. To survey and produce plans of sites for development projects.
"
2698,"5. To print, and possibly draw, maps of surveys by other departments (e.g. Geological Survey, Soil Survey, Forest Resources Survey).
"
2699,"The training of staff (Junior and Operating) and construction of the building will be completed during the first three years of the Plan period.
"
2700,"Drawing and reproduction of map sheets will begin in 1974-75 and continue from that date.
"
2701,"e. 	Training
"
2702,"The importance of trained personnel can be hardly exaggerated if there is to be a fast and efficient completion of the different survey programmes.
"
2703,"The Survey Training Centre is continuing its training programme for the staffs of the survey parties, as well as sending survey personnel to foreign countries for training.
"
2704,"The programme of the Survey Training Centre will be expanded for training in different subjects in order to cope with the expanded activities in the revenue, trigonometrical,maintenance, and topographical surveys.
"
2705,"2. Land Reform Programme
"
2706,"(a) 	Compulsory Savings Scheme:
"
2707,"The main and foremost objective of this programme is to accelerate the growth of the agricultural sector by transfering the inactive capital remaining in the agriculture sector to the non- agricultural sector.
"
2708,"In addition to this, protection of tenancy rights and an end to unnecessary economic pressures on the peasants should be attempted.
"
2709,"During the Fourth Plan period, it has been estimated that the collection of compulsory savings will amount to Rs 60 million.
"
2710,"(b) 	Auditing and Proper Management of Savings:
"
2711,"The objective of land reform cannot be achieved only by collecting savings.
"
2712,"It is very necessary to utilize the savings in an effective manner.
"
2713,"To overcome the misappropriation of savings, it is very urgent to audit all the account records and to keep the records intact and in order. During this Plan period, the target for regular auditing of savings has been fixed at 17,019 wards.
"
2714,"(c) 	Protection and Proper Management of Tenancy Rights:
"
2715,"It is very necessary to protect and secure tenancy rights, in order to increase production by providing incentive to the real tenant who is supposed to till the land.
"
2716,"To minimize the great disparity in the distribution of land, to increase agricultural production and to create an atmosphere in which investment of inactive capital may be chanelled from the agriculture sector to the non-agricultural sector, the provision of land ceilings has been made.
"
2717,"Those lands which are above the ceiling will be distributed to the tenants and landless peasants in order of priority. It has been difficult to distribute the excess boundaries of land above the ceiling could not be determined.
"
2718,"For this reason, the programme of land sale and distribution will be carried out in only those 39 districts where the Revenue Survey will be completed.
"
2719,"(f) 	Determination of Loan:
"
2720,"To free the peasants from the clutches of the money lenders and other unnecessary exploitation by traditional credit systems, a programme to determine the actual amount of agricultural credit is still in operation.
"
2721,"During the Fourth Plan period, the target has been fixed for the determination of agricultural credit to the approximate amount of Rs 40 million, out of which the remaining amount not completed during the last plan period will be calculated.
"
2722,"3. Land Administration
"
2723,"(1) In the process of economic growth, the overall development programme of a landlocked country like ours can progress only with well organized and expanded transport facilities.
"
2724,"The infusion of development ideas in these regions depends largely on the availability of adequate transportation.
"
2725,"It is only through transport expansion that that development projects of all types can flourish together through mutual co-ordination and integration.
"
2726,"The rugged topography of the country has posed a formidable problem to all sorts of transport, and because of this, even in the highly emphasized agricultural sector, production targets have not been reached.
"
2727,"Thus it is evident from our experience (as well other countries ), that unless transportation is sufficiently developed; development programmes cannot be effectively implemented.
"
2728,"Consequently, transportation has been given top priority. Furthermore, its development is necessary to bring about efficiency and coordination in administration, to overcome regional disparity, and to mobilize scattered and surplus labour from agriculture to other sectors.
"
2729,"(2) With the availability of cheap, speedy and far reaching transport facilities, isolated rural substances economies can now find markets and, therefore, form larger and more efficient producing units and replace barter with a cash economy.
"
2730,"Communities or regions so connected and integrated become more productive and more or less self sufficient, causing inter-regional trade to grow on the basis of specialization and comparative advantage.
"
2731,"Thus, transport development, though by no means guarantee of economic growth, does make direct and indirect contributions to national income through a more productive utilization of time and an expansion of almost all sectors of the economy.
"
2732,"In short, transport development contributes to economic development in the following ways: (a)  Enlarging the market and thereby further stimulating economic specialization; (b)  Helping exploitation of additional resources by making them accessible and thereby enlarging employment and rehabilitation;
"
2733,"(c)  Leading to the establishment and for expansion of related industries by making them accessible to raw materials and
"
2734,"(d) Enhancing the optimum utilization of resources and making the means of production more dynamic.
"
2735,"(3) Communication has its own importance, and to a larger extent, it acts as a complement to transport.
"
2736,"Only through the expansion of communication channels, can we utilize the transport facility at its maximum capability.
"
2737,"The need for all types of communication grows rapidly in every sector of the economy during the process of development.
"
2738,"In fact, organized communication channels are the only way to satisfy the increasing needs.
"
2739,"Modern life can not be imagined without a developed and modernized communication system.
"
2740,"In spite of the importance of transport and communication, to this day historical and geographical factors divide the country into several parts; people are isolated in their villages during the rainy season because of landslides and flood. 2 Objectives:
"
2741,"No important development programme can succeed without the proper organization of transport and communication.
"
2742,"Their development in the Fourth Plan will be based upon the following objectives: (a) To help strengthen, promote and protect the constitutional system, nation and nationality, together with territorial integrity.
"
2743,"(b)  To create the essential pre-conditions of transport and communication in order to implement the economic, social and other related development programmes.
"
2744,"(c)  To open up the remote areas which have remained in isolation for centuries by providing transport and communication facilities.
"
2745,"(d)  To speed up the pace of progress with a view to imparting an element of dynamism into society and thereby enhancing efficiency in the public and private sectors.
"
2746,"3. Policy:
"
2747,"Surface roads, waterways, airways ,ropeways and railways comprise the different modes of transportation, although it is not possible to consider them as equally important. Therefore, the type of transport, which is most speedy and stable and yields the quickest returns will be emphasized.
"
2748,"The rugged terrain of the country has limited the expansion of railways, and within this Plan period, only a necessary feasibility survey will be undertaken. Air transportation, though expensive and primarily beneficial to only a section of the well-to-do-class, will nevertheless be extended as a temporary measure to all those economically feasible areas, as well as to those places necessary from an administrative or tourist point of view.
"
2749,"Therefore, air transport has been given second priority after roads.
"
2750,"River navigation, as a solution to our transport problem, is unfeasible because of the rugged topography.
"
2751,"Ropeway extension in the hills looks attractive on theoretical ground, but not from a cost-benefit point of view. Since roads are the most dependable means of transport, the emphasis in the near future will be given to the construction of roads.
"
2752,"In the field of communication, telecommunication and postal services will be given due consideration. So far, postal service is the only means which is serving the majority of the population. Its need is continuously increasing because of the increase in transport extension and educational facilities.
"
2753,"The National Planning Commission has based the road development programme of Fourth Plan on the “20 year Highway Plan in Nepal”.
"
2754,"Keeping in mind the unique topography and the limited resources in hand, all the districts and zonal headquarters will be linked by motorable road in accordance with the long- term plan.
"
2755,"Since road building is a time consuming process, it would be unreasonable to tie our hands without proceeding with some transport development work in those districts where road construction is supposed to continue in future. Attention will therefore be devoted not only to the construction of existing roads, but also to the improvement of primitive tracks and the construction of new ones.
"
2756,"In this context, efforts will be made to prepare maps with the cost estimates of various roads in the country.
"
2757,"In order to provide swift and efficient administration, the entire road network has been classified in the following manner:
"
2758,"Highway  Trunk Road Road Jeep track Mule track Foot track  sIn view of the need for a  table and strong organization for the proper development and maintenance of roads, three categories of roads have been devised so that minimum requirements for construction and maintenance are fulfilled.
"
2759,"This has been done because further classification is considered unnecessary at present.
"
2760,"1. Highway: Roads, which are considered to be strategic from a national view point are included in this category.
"
2761,"All highways should have the recommended width, sub-base and local bearing capacity.
"
2762,"His Majesty’s Government (HMG) will assume the responsibility for construction and maintenance.
"
2763,"2. Main road: Roads, which are less important and shorter than the highway, but like several districts and zones are included in this category.
"
2764,"HMG will decide the minimum standards, both physical and technical, for these roads.
"
2765,"The task of repairing and maintenance will rest with the local authorities of HMG. 3. Freeder road:
"
2766,"Roads, which are generally short in distance when compared with the main road and connect only one or two districts and which are only important locally are included in this category.
"
2767,"The road surface will be black topped, graveled, or unmetalled according to the region.
"
2768,"HMG will take the appropriate steps for the maintenance of such roads, including the complete inventory of road lists.
"
2769,"The local authorities will also share some responsibility in this matter.
"
2770,"Even a concentrated road building effort will not complete the project in a short period due to complete neglect for a century.
"
2771,"Henceforth it has been necessary to classify those transport facilities which provide for the movement of mules and people a ‘foot and bridle path’. Most of the transport facilities available in the country are in this condition.
"
2772,"In the Terai, there are similar narrow tracks called “Pagdandi”.
"
2773,"The sole responsibility and maintenance of such tracks will lie with the Panchayats themselves.
"
2774,"For the present, necessary maintenance and improvement will be undertaken in most remote areas as required and the standard of mule -tracks will also be improved.
"
2775,"4. Mule tracks:
"
2776,"The tracks which offer two way traffic for mules are included in this category.
"
2777,"These mule tracks can be quite wide at places, but the absence of bridges and culverts, together with the step ups and downs, restric t the operation of vehicular traffic.
"
2778,"5. Jeep track: The tracks where the movement of carts and jeeps is possible are included in this category.
"
2779,"Such tracks will help to link village and farms on the one hand and villages and markets on the other- especially in the Terai region.
"
2780,"Such tracks are quite important at present and will continue to be so in the future. It can be hoped that economic prosperity of the region will automatically lead to further development of fair-weather feeder roads.
"
2781,"6. Road construction Progress up to Date: In 1951, the total length of roads existing in the country was only 376 kilometers, including 5Km. of pitched and 83 Km. of graveled roads.
"
2782,"Prior to the First Five Year Plan, the total length of roads in kingdom of Nepal was 624 Km. Including 259 Km. of all-weather and 365 Km.
"
2783,"Fair-weather roads. In the First Plan (1956/57-60/61), the target set for road construction was 1,440 Km. which included 480 Km.
"
2784,"All-weather and 960 Km. Fair-weather roads.
"
2785,"Progress achieved during this period was 912 Kilometers of roads, including 170 Km.
"
2786,"According to the revised target of the Third Plan (1965-70), it was envisaged to construct 1,365 kilometers of roads, including 753 kilometers all-weather and 607 kilometers fair-weather.
"
2787,"Out of this, 1,009 kilometer or 80 per cent of the target has been achieved including 405 Km. black top, 230 Km. gravel, and 455 Km. fair-weather roads.
"
2788,"Efforts will, therefore, be made to complete the Mahendra Highway, as well as the construction of new highways and trunk roads which will link those areas of the Himalayan, Hilly and Terai regions having complementary economic relations.
"
2789,"This will help the industrial areas of Mechi, Koshi, and Janakpur zones, take full advantage of the highway, thereby, enhancing the volume of their internal trade as well facilitate the transportation of raw materials needed for local industries.
"
2790,"The process of black topping the 23 kilometre fair-weather road which connects Jaleshwor with Janakpur will be completed in the first year of the Fourth Plan.
"
2791,"Completion of this road will connect and therefore contribute and a great deal to the industrial areas of the Eastern Terai.
"
2792,"A (2) Kamala bridge:
"
2793,"A (3) Simra-Janakpur (Dhalkewar-Pathlaiya):
"
2794,"This sector, which is a part of the Mahendra Highway in the east, was planned to be completed in the third plan. However, because of several factors, it was possible to complete only 28 kilometres of black top and 26 kilometres gravel and two other bridges during the third plan.
"
2795,"During fourth plan, it has been envisaged to complete the entire road in black top.
"
2796,"Completion of this road will link the important areas of Janakpur and Narayani zones.
"
2797,"Besides this, the sector to be constructed with Indian co-operation stretching from Jhapa to Janakpur will be ready in 1971 and will help to bring together the people of Jhapa and Kathmandu by increasing cultural contacts.
"
2798,"Up to Bagmati, 8 major bridges and 72 small bridges and culverts are needed. From Bagmati onwards, another 17 major bridges and 50 minor bridges and culverts are estimated to be required.
"
2799,"A (4) Narayangarh-Butwal:
"
2800,"The existing portion of the Mahendra Highway from Narayanghat west to Butwal was supposed to be built as a fair-weather road in the Third Plan with the assistance and credit to British Government. The 122 kilometers road will be converted to black top by the end of this Plan period.
"
2801,"This will link the Narayani and Lumbini zones together with creating an area of potential development in central Nepal.
"
2802,"A (5) Prithvi Highway:
"
2803,"This road starts from Naubise, a point on the Tribhuban Highway, connecting Dharke, Galchi, Gajuritar, Muglinphant and Damauli to Pokhara. This project was begun in 1967-68 with Chinese Aid During the Third Plan, out of 176 kilometres, 20 kilometre of gravelling had been completed, and the first jeep has already reached Pokhara.
"
2804,"The entire length of the road will be gravelled by the first half of the Fourth Plan.
"
2805,"Completion of this road will connect the central hilly regions of Bagmati, Narayani and Gandaki zones.
"
2806,"This will facilitate the growth of horticulture centers and other similar development projects in turn increasing the standard of living of the local people.
"
2807,"This road will also carry both tourists and pilgrims to Bandipur, Gorkha and Manakamana areas and will contribute towards increasing the national income.
"
2808,"A. (6) Dhangarhi-Dadheldura:
"
2809,"The construction of 145 kilometres from Dhangarhi to Dadheldhura was started during the Third Plan, partially under American assistance.
"
2810,"Sixty-five kilometres of fair-weather road were completed, both in the Terai and Hilly regions, by the last year of the Third Plan.
"
2811,"The entire length of the road will be gravelled by the fourth year of the Plan.
"
2812,"This road will connect the food deficit areas of the Far Western Hills, such as Doti, Baitadi, Achham and Bajura with the Terai. Moreover, this will facilitate the availailify of daily consumption goods and will create the necessary precondition for the development of these areas.
"
2813,"The possibilities of horticultural and other development in these districts are promising and can be explored extensively. The hills, particularly the Himalayan region, are favourable for the production of apples, walnuts and other fruits, which have a good export-market.
"
2814,"Also about 6,000 maunds of ghee are exported to India every year through Rajapur Customs from the above districts.
"
2815,"Completion of this project will increase direct contact between the producers and the consumers and will also help uplift the standard of the local people.
"
2816,"This will also increase national and per capita income. Moreever, this road will bring the hinterland of Dhadeldura very close and will act as a forward link to Doti, Baitadi, Achham, Darchula, Bajura and Bajhang. Its importance has been further enhanced by economic and social needs.
"
2817,"It will have 43 major and minor bridges, along with 60 culverts. A.
"
2818,"(7) Bhaktapur-Kathmandu: The number of passengers traveling daily along this route is approximately 5,641 by 31 buses.
"
2819,"In fact, large quantities of vegetables and other food stuffs required in Kathmandu are supplied by areas served by this route.
"
2820,"T his route has facilitated the growth of inter-regional trade between Banepa, Dhulikhel, Barabise and Kathmandu.
"
2821,"Of late, this road between Bhagtapur and Kathmandu has become quite narrow  and congested because of the increasing volume of traffic.
"
2822,"This has resulted in significant inconveniences to passengers and increased dangers from accidents.
"
2823,"In addition, the operating costs of the vehicles have increased considerably.
"
2824,"Consequently, the increased cost in diesel and petrol alone has amounted to Rs 500,000 annually.
"
2825,"Thus, as an alternative, a new road has been under construction with Chinese assistance from
"
2826,"Thapathali to Bhaktapur since the fourth year of the Third Plan. The entire length of the 13 kilometer road will be black-topped during the first year of the Fourth Plan.
"
2827,"Completion of this road will not only help the passengers, but will also reduce the operating costs and contribute indirectly to an national income.
"
2828,"The main centers to which agricultural products are brought down from the hills or produced and collected for marketing in the Terai are Nepalgunj, Rajapur, Dhangarhi and Mahendranagar.
"
2829,"These serve both as export centers for agricultural commodities and import-centres for consumer foods from India.
"
2830,"Mahendranagar is a flourishing trade center but because of transport difficulties, it conducts all of its trade with India instead of the Terai area to the east.
"
2831,"Completion of this road will facilitate the linking of the districts of Seti, Bheri, Mahakali and Terai portion of Rapti and Lubini zones, as well as helping to increase the exporting capacity of these areas.
"
2832,"The need for this highway has also been regarded as most urgent because it will connect important parts of the country: i.e., the hills with the resource rich area in the East and West Terai.
"
2833,"The road would also help to integrate the economies of these areas. B.
"
2834,"(2) Hetauda-Narayangarh and Narayani Bridge: In the Third Plan, survey and investigation work were completed for the raising of the Hetauda- Narayangarh road to highway standards.
"
2835,"This road is a connecting link to the Mahendra Highway in the Western sector.
"
2836,"The construction work on this 83 kilometers long highway will be black topped by 1974-75, along with the improved bridges and culverts which are needed.
"
2837,"Appropriate arrangements will be made to continue transportation across the Narayani river.
"
2838,"There has been a ferry-service across this river for some time.
"
2839,"C.  Growth Axis Roads construction
"
2840,"Furthermore, the limited land resources and low producticity in the hills have made people move in search of employment and trade opportunities in the Surkhet, Dang and Nepalgunj areas.
"
2841,"This will shift the population from Dailekh, Jumla and the surrounding areas to Surkhet, Dang and Nepalgunj, thereby giving rise to likely population problems in the future.
"
2842,"Therefore, construction of this road can help in the establishment of small development projects which, in turn, will partially help to solve the unemployment problem.
"
2843,"In the Fourth Plan, 77 kilometres of road connecting Nepalgunj and Surkhet will be constructed. Since Nepalgunj is the trading center of western Nepal, road will open up the surrounding districts and enable them to expand their trade.
"
2844,"C. (2) Putalikhet-Baglung-Tukuche -Jomsom:
"
2845,"This is a feeder road of the Siddhartha Highway, connecting Bhairahawa, Palpa, Syangja, Pokhara, Balgunj, Tukuche and Jomsom in Mustang district.
"
2846,"With exception of one STOL airfield in Jomsom, other modern means of transport are not available in this area.
"
2847,"This has, therefore, been considered to be an inaccessible area.
"
2848,"Moreover, this road is not necessary to create willingness among the local people to participate in the development projects, but also to obviate the difficulties lying in education and health. Construction of this road will also help develop tourism, as well as enable a greater inflow of pilgrims to Muktinath.
"
2849,"It will help develop the surrounding villages as well. During the Fourth Plan, 80 kilometres of this road from Putalikhet to Baglung will be constructed.
"
2850,"C. (3) Trishuli-Dhunche-Gatlang:
"
2851,"Although the route to Dhunche passing through Birgunj, Hetauda, Kathmandu and Trishuli was mentioned in the policy guidelines of the draft of the Fourth Plan, the economic and technical survey found this route to be unfeasible.
"
2852,"Consequently, an alternative route to Syabru and Gatlang has been considered.
"
2853,"The total length of this route will be 150 kilometres of which the 70 kilometres from Kathmandu to Trishuli is already in existence as a fair-weather road, which will be black topped in the Fourth Plan.
"
2854,"Thus from Trishuli to Gatlang, 80 kilometres must be constructed.
"
2855,"During the Fourth Plan, 35 kilometres of jeepable track from Trishuli to Dhunche will be constructed on a fair-weather basis.
"
2856,"With this road construction dairy, horticulture, and other activities can be developed.
"
2857,"Moreover, the facility will attract a greater number of tourists and pilgrims to Gosainkunda.
"
2858,"This road can further help to exploit the unutilized timber resources of Gatlang areas-amounting annually to approximately 2 million cu. ft., with Kathmandu serving as a potential market.
"
2859,"C. (4) Dharan-Dhankuta-Khandhari:
"
2860,"This route will provide limited modern transport facilities to the local people of Sankhuwasabha, Taplejung, Terathum, Dhankuta, Bhojpur and the surrounding districts.
"
2861,"With regard to modern transport facilities, there is only one airfield at Tumlingtar.
"
2862,"In the Fourth Plan, the 72 kilometres from Dharan to Dhankuta will be made motorable for general vehicles. This will solve to some extent the transport problem in the districts of Dhankuta, Terathum, Sankhuwasha, Taplejung and Bhojpur.
"
2863,"The Khuku and Chintang orange which are famous all over India and Nepal will be provided with larger markets. This will stimulate the local people to develop the more profitable horticulture farmings instead of cereal foods as a source of enhancing their income.
"
2864,"In the future, Dhankuta can become a citrus fruit center, having a linkage effect upon other districts as well. The completion of this road will facilitate the development of adjoining areas and also lessen regional disparities.
"
2865,"D.  Inter-district and Intra-district roads:
"
2866,"The Eastern Terai portion of the Mahendra Highway and a portion of the Prithvi Highway in the hills are already in service.
"
2867,"Therefore, during the Fourth Plan period, it has become necessary to construct feeder roads to link the productive areas and populous regions with the highways.
"
2868,"Under this programme, Jhapa, Kapilvastu and Rautahat in the Terai, Dang in Inner Terai and
"
2869,"The total length of these roads constructed during the Plan be 150 kilometres of gravelled surface.
"
2870,"Details are as follows:
"
2871,"(1)  Gorkha-Prithvi Highway:
"
2872,"Gorkha currently supplies some of its surplus products to Rasuwa, Nuwakot, Dhading, Lamjung, Tanahun and Kaski districts.
"
2873,"The interconnection of these districts through the development of road will quicken the pace of economic development as well as increase the standard of living of the local people.
"
2874,"Its historical background and natural beauty have made Gorkha a potential tourist centers.
"
2875,"During the Plan period a gravelled feeder road will be constructed to reach Gorkha.
"
2876,"The total length of this road will be 25 kilometres. It will be feeder road to the Prithvi Highway.
"
2877,"(2)  Chautara-Araniko (Kodari) Highway:
"
2878,"A fair-weather jeepable track connecting the Araniko Highway with Chautara has already been constructed in Sindhupalchok district with voluntary labour of the people.
"
2879,"This district has partially supplied the growing demand for meat and fish in Kathmandu.
"
2880,"The conversion of this road to an all-wrather one will enable it to bear large vehicles, thereby extending the market for market for fruits and ghee of this area. In addition, there are favourable prospects for the development and promotion of the cheese industry.
"
2881,"During the Plan period, the existing road will be gravelled and its width increased.
"
2882,"The total length of this road will be 26 kilometres.
"
2883,"(3)  Gaur-Mahendra Highway:
"
2884,"This area through which the road will pass is the most fertile in Rautahat district.
"
2885,"However, the lack of markets has restricted the promotion and development of local products.
"
2886,"Moreover, cash crop like sugarcane are grown to a greater extent because they are easily irrigated by the Bagmati river.
"
2887,"In the Plan period, a feeder road from Mahendra Highway to Gaur will be constructed.
"
2888,"The total length of 33 kilometres will be graveled.
"
2889,"Completion of this road will enable products from this district to have access to markets.
"
2890,"It will be easier for Birgunj Sugar Factory to run at full capacity because the road will connect it to the sugarcane growing areas in Gaur.
"
2891,"(4)  Krishnanagar-Bahadurgunj-Mahendra Highway:
"
2892,"Krishnanagar and Bahadurgunj are important among the trade centers and other notable areas of the Western Terai.
"
2893,"Even in terms of population, those notable two towns rank high in the region, They cater to the export and import trade of hilly districts such as Piuthan and Argakhanchi. Therefore, it has become extremely necessary to connect these areas with the hilly districts through proper roads.
"
2894,"The important exports from these areas are paddy, sugarcane and timber.
"
2895,"In Krishnanagar alone, approximately 2,000 hectares are under sugarcane cultivation.
"
2896,"The past plans have encouraged the growth of small development projects in these areas.
"
2897,"Consequently, the need to interconnect these regions by road has become greater.
"
2898,"Therefore, within the Fourth Plan, a 20 kilometre gravelled road will connect Krishnanagar and Bahadurgunj with Mahendra Highway in such a way that it could be further extended to the hills in the north in the future.
"
2899,"(5)  Dang-Mahendra Highway:
"
2900,"Dang districts in the Rapti Zone in the Western Inner Terai acts as a trading center of the hilly districts of Sallyan, Piuthan, Rukum and Rolpa.
"
2901,"A large amount of paddy, rice and ghee are exported through this route.
"
2902,"Presently, transport bottlenecks have prevented the local products from selling at higher prices.
"
2903,"Thus, a 16 kilometre gravelled feeder road from Dang to Mahendra Highway will be constructed.
"
2904,"Construction of this road will help take the local products to better markets as well as help improve the standard of living.
"
2905,"(6)  Chandragadhi-Mahendra Highway:
"
2906,"Chandragadhi is the headquarter of the Jhapa district in Mechi Zone.
"
2907,"In fact, this district is the most prosperious and fertile in all of Nepal.
"
2908,"Jhapa district by itself produces 10 per cent of the total paddy production of the entire country.
"
2909,"The completion of the Mahendra Highway will certainly help to augment internal and external trade, however, this goal will remain unfulfilled until a feeder road from Dhulabari to the most fertile area in the south is constructed.
"
2910,"Therefore, in this Plan,16 kilometres of gravelled road from Dhulabari to Chandragadhi will be constructed.
"
2911,"Completion of this road will help the establishment of jute processing, paper and other allied industries.
"
2912,"(7)  Rajbiraj-Mahendra Highway:
"
2913,"Rajbiraj has its own importance as the headquarters of Sagarmatha Zone. Chandra canal and other such irrigation facilities have made this area very fertile and densely populated.
"
2914,"In addition to paddy, large quantities of raw jute, mustard, timber and other goods are exported to India.
"
2915,"The present Mahendra Highway which passes through Lahan provides a prospective market for the local products of Udaipur and other hilly districts.
"
2916,"This will also add to the income of the local people.
"
2917,"Feeder road construction from Rajbiraj to Mahendra Highway will facilitate the movement of food grains.
"
2918,"Consequently, in this Plan period, 14 kilometres of gravelled roads from Rajbiraj to Mahendra Highway will be constructed.
"
2919,"E.  Urban Roads:
"
2920,"Under this project, 25 kilometres of black topped road will be constructed in Kathmandu and other urban areas.
"
2921,"The details are as follows:
"
2922,"E.(1) Kathmandu Valley Roads:
"
2923,"Kathmandu is important for many reasons.
"
2924,"As the capital of the country Kathmandu’s urban population has been rapidly increasing. The number of vehicles registered has increased from 1,845 in 1958 to 6,710 in 1968.
"
2925,"However, the road capacity in Kathmandu has not increased at the same rate.
"
2926,"It has therefore been planned to increase the capacity of the roads as well as to upgrade some roads by black topping.
"
2927,"E.(2) Other Urban Roads :
"
2928,"The improvement and construction work of the road in Pokhara will begin in 1972/73. Pokhara needs roads because it is the main town for the Central Hills and has good prospects for tourism.
"
2929,"Moreover, with the completion of the Siddarth Highway and the near completion of the Prithvi Highway, the expected increase in the volume of traffic of men and vehicles will require improved roads in Pokhara.
"
2930,"In accordance with needs, the existing fair-weather roads of other urban areas will also be black topped.
"
2931,"F.  Roads to be completed after the Feasibility Survey:
"
2932,"The World Bank team will conduct a technical and economic feasibility survey for roads throughout the country. In this Plan, about 100 kilometres of gravelled roads will be constructed according to the priorities of the survey report.
"
2933,"The following roads have also been included in the survey:
"
2934,"F.(1) Lahan-Okhaldhunga:
"
2935,"It has been estimated that the districts of Sagarmatha Zone (especially Okhaldhunga) have been facing deficits of about 7,677 metric tons of food-grain every year.
"
2936,"Lahan has been considered to be a main market center to this area for both social and economic reasons.
"
2937,"Potatoes and fruits are grown in Udaipur and Okhaldhunga, but only for local consumption.
"
2938,"Similarly, the cheese producing plant in Solukhumbu is incurring high transportation costs trying to get its products to market.
"
2939,"F.(2) Kathmandu-Simra:
"
2940,"The volume of traffic and the danger of accidents on the Tribhuwan Highway have increased considerably. Also, the long route passing through steep hills and sharp bends has led to greater fuel consumption and shortened the lives of vehicles.This has brought to light the need for an alternative to the Tribhuban Rajpath which will be shorter, more comfortable, and more economic.
"
2941,"The length of this road will be 96 kilometres instead of the 144 kilometers of the Tribhuban Rajpath.
"
2942,"F.(3) Dang-Jajarkot:
"
2943,"Substantial amounts of food-grain, fruits, ghee, and other items are exported to India through
"
2944,"Transport difficulties have posed a formidable problem to move the foodgrain to deficit areas like Jajarkot and Sallyan.
"
2945,"Oranges are grown in the districts of Sallyan and Jajarkot, and there is good potential for the development of these export-oriented horticultural products.
"
2946,"If the linking of this road is possible, there are chances for the growth of a needed organized market which will promote exports of these products.
"
2947,"F.(4) Jhapa-Taplejung:
"
2948,"Both Illam and Taplejung are deficit in food-grains. Illam alone imports about 2,728 metric tons of food-grains from surplus areas of the country.
"
2949,"Simultaneously, Jhapa exports 60,000 metric tons of food- grains to India every year.
"
2950,"If suitable transportation were available, food-grains could easily be sent from Jhapa to these deficit districts in a shorter period of time and at a lower cost.
"
2951,"Also, there is the possibility of setting up a herb extraction plant in Taplejung which has a significant export potential.
"
2952,"There is also potential for the development of potatoes, fruits, and tea farming in Illam with good markets in India.
"
2953,"F.(5) Narayanghat-Prithvi Highway (Muglinphant):
"
2954,"Narayanghat, a small town in Chitwan, is flourishing as an important center of trade and industrial activity.
"
2955,"It has also absorbed large numbers of settlers from Gorkha, Bandipur and other surrounding hilly areas.
"
2956,"Development projects, such as the Rapti Valley Project has also generated some economic activity in this region. Presently, Narayanghat is serving as the main food-grain market center for the hilly regions of Bandipur and Gorkha.
"
2957,"Substantial amount of mustard and timber are also exported from this area.
"
2958,"Furthermore, this area has been supplying a great deal of firewood to Kathmandu Valley.
"
2959,"Narayanghat Bazar is only 25 Km. away from Muglinphant, a village on the Prithvi Highwaay.
"
2960,"Opening a feeder road from Narayanghat to Muglinphant will link the districts of Lumbini, Gandaki and Bagmati zones.
"
2961,"Besides, a straight route would be opened between Birgunj and Pokhara on the one hand and Bhairahawa and Kathmandu on the other.
"
2962,"Moreover, this will provide a more convenient and speedy route than the Tribhuban Highway it is about 200 kilometers to Kathmandu.
"
2963,"However, by the new route coming up from Narayanghat via the Prithvi Highway, it will be about 135 kilometers only.
"
2964,"In addition, this will facilitate food-grain movement at fair prices from Chitwan and Nawalparasi to Bandipur, Gorkha, Tanahu and Pokhara during times of food shortage.
"
2965,"It will facilitate the movement of man and material, as well as reduce the pressure of accidents on the Tribhuban Highway.
"
2966,"For the districts of Janakpur Zone, the road will serve as a base for development.
"
2967,"Also, from an economic point of view, a road will help in extending the trade of Ramechhap, Dhulikhel and Dolkha and other hilly regions with other Terai centers and Indian markets.
"
2968,"The road development programme to be initiated in the Fourth Plan will not, however, connect all parts of the country by motorable roads.
"
2969,"Thus with the exception of Kathmandu, the Terai and some other parts of the hills, the need for foot and mule tracks will remain for some decades to come.
"
2970,"The total length of such trails in Nepal has been estimated to be 10,000 kilometers. The village people generally must pass over such trails for trade and purchase of their daily consumption.
"
2971,"Inaccessible areas will be connected through motorable roads in accordance with the long- term plan.
"
2972,"However, our limited resources are not adequate for such immediate transport undertakings. Therefore, about 1,652 existing foot and mule tracks in the following districts will be improved and constructed, keeping in mind the growing needs of the localities.
"
2973,"The details are given below: considered the most backward in terms of transportation facilities and the most sparcely populated. This will provide some of the economic and social needs.They will be located in the following locations.
"
2974,"I.  Bridges and Culverts Construction and Improvement:
"
2975,"But it is evident that limited resources do not permit us to construct and improve bridges in all places at the same time Therefore, HMG will construct bridges over those rivers with the greatest traffic.
"
2976,"In addition, alternative routes will be considered keeping in view the volume of traffic.
"
2977,"Also, four worn-out bridges in Kathmandu which are not capable of bearing any further heavy load will be replaced and constructed according to a new standard. J.
"
2978,"Roads to be improved:
"
2979,"Due to a rapid increase in the volume of men and materials, and the use heavy vehicles, about 400 kilometers of roads which were classified as substandard in the Third plan will be improved considerably.
"
2980,"The name of roads are as follows:
"
2981,"1. Raxaul-Hetauda and Kathmandu-Hetauda (Tribhuwan Highway)
"
2982,"2. Kathmandu-Trisuli
"
2983,"3. Other roads(Padma road,Biratnagar, Rangeli etc.) j. (1) Raxaul-Hetauda and Kathmandu-Hetauda (Tribhuvan Highway)
"
2984,"K.  Miscellaneous:
"
2985,"It has become quite essential to improve the methodology of the formulation of development projects during the process of development. Therefore, in the Plan, proper arrangements will be made for studying the construction of new roads.
"
2986,"The report available from this study will certainly form a dependable base for this Plan, and more particularly, for the Fifth Plan.
"
2987,"By the end of this Plan, more black top roads will be ready, although they may not be able to meet our requirements.
"
2988,"Future generations can receive the benefits only when these roads are properly maintained.
"
2989,"“Therefore, due consideration will be given to the protection and maintenance of the national road network.
"
2990,"Attention has been given to making the Road Department more efficient by saving expensive and modern equipments. However, arrangements will be made to provide the essential equipments.
"
2991,"Since road construction has been carried out on the basis of the knowledge and experience of other countries, construction materials, equipment, and techniques have accordingly been foreign.
"
2992,"However, it seems very unsatisfactory to continue this system. Therefore, a construction material laboratory for testing the utility of construction materials will be established.
"
2993,"Thus, if these facilities can be developed properly, it will lead to reduced construction costs for road development through the utilization of local materials and the savings of foreign exchange.
"
2994,"In order to complete these programmes, the decision will be finalized after necessary consultation with the U.N.D.P. Special Fund and I.D.A.
"
2995,"During the Fourth Plan it is hoped to complete the entire programme.
"
2996,"Financial Investment on Roads:
"
2997,"In the Fourth Plan, 813.1 million rupees or 82 per cent of the total outlay in the transportation and communication sector, will be spent on road development.
"
2998,"Furthermore, out of the 813.1 million rupees, the pattern of expenditures will be as follows: 533.4 million rupees for continuing projects; 91.8 million for the growth axis roads;31 million rupees for the inter-district facilities; 16.2 million rupees for urban roads; 30 million rupees for the roads to be constructed after the feasibility survey; 9 million rupees for the foot and mule tracks; 49 million rupees for suspension bridges; 22.5 million rupees for the improvement of roads; and 30.2 million rupees for miscellaneous purposes.
"
2999,"The details are given below: Uncompleted activities.
"
3000,"Rs 17 million allocated for the construction of the Kamala bridge and Kathmandu-Bhaktapur road is not shown in the breakdown.
"
3001,"* Sectionwise activities on Mahendra HIghway.
"
3002,"** Includes (1) Gorkha -Prithvi Highway (2) Chantara-Araniko Highw ay (3) Gaur-Mahendra Highway & other regional roads. *** Includes Bardiya, Bhojpur, Gulmi, Illam, Dailekh, Sindhuli, Taplejung, Sankhuwasava, Solukhumbu, Dolakha, Sindhupalchowk, Rasuwa, Dhading, Gorkha, Manang, Mustang, Dolpa, Tribrikokt, Jumla, Mugh, Humla, Bhajang, Darchula & Baitadi.
"
3003,"NATIONAL TRANSPORT CORPORATION
"
3004,"The primary aim of this corporation is to play the leading role in traffic operation.
"
3005,"Therefore, it has set the following policies: (a) To carry out its business in a healthy atmosphere emphasizing the trade motive; (b) To operate the vehicles on new highway and other roads by just covering the operating costs; and (c) To base the means of transport as far as possible on resources available in the country.
"
3006,"In accordance with these policies, the Transport Corporation has included the following projects in the Fourth Plan:
"
3007,"(a) Extension of truck and bus services on Sunouli-Pokhara (Siddartha) and other highways; (b) Extension and expansion of railway line ( if justified by the feasibility study); and (c) Operation of Trolly -bus service (if justified by feasibility study)
"
3008,"1. Extension of Truck and Bus services in the Siddartha (Sunouli-Pokhara) and other highways:
"
3009,"The provision of transport facilities o new completed highways will be a desired goal of the Government, keeping in mind the road network and volume of traffic.
"
3010,"This will facilitate the movement of men and materials, as well as reducing bottlenecks. Furthermore, the Transport Corporation will be strengthened and made more efficient, thereby enabling the accessible areas to get the supply of needed materials for construction, industry, etc. in time.
"
3011,"About 125 additional trucks will be made available for service on the roads to be completed during the Fourth Plan period. This will help to strengthen the trucking units, and help to complete construction works in different zones in time.
"
3012,"2. Extension of Railways (if justified by feasibility study)
"
3013,"Railway services are constructed to be one of the important means of transport.
"
3014,"It has occupied a prominent role in the transportation system of neighbouring countries.
"
3015,"In Nepal, it has been possible to operate railway services in only two places because of the high costs of construction and maintenance.
"
3016,"The railway services operating between Amlekhjung and Raxaul (N.G.R.) has virtually closed down since the development of parallel surface road in the area. On the other hand the Janakpur-Jayanagar railway service is operating successfully and has been further extended.
"
3017,"In the context of highways expansion, there seems to be little ground for the further development of railways, although necessary surveys will be undertaken to study the expansion of such services to feasible areas.
"
3018,"In this regard, the feasibility survey for construction of a broad gauge railway line between
"
3019,"Raxaul and Hetauda and Hetauda and Kathmandu will be completed.
"
3020,"A feasibility study will also be undertaken for the extension of railway line from Mahinathpur to Chisapani. 3. Operation of Trollybus (if justified by feasibility study)
"
3021,"This bus is operated with the use of hydro- electric power. Since the supply of hydro electric - power in the country is increasing and the need for large quantities of diesel and petrol have necessitated dependence upon foreign countries, it might be more economic to develop a transport system based upon the utilization of power.
"
3022,"An initial survey will be done about setting up an electrical trolly bus service along Kathmandu-Bhaktapur route. this route has a large volume of traffic and a wide road is recently being constructed.
"
3023,"Attempts will be made to operate an electric trolly bus service if it is found to be feasible by the study.
"
3024,"4. Financial Outlay: It is estimated that Rs 2.6 million will be required  f or the implementation of the above mentioned projects.
"
3025,"(1) Purchase of additional trucks  Rs 2.4 million
"
3026,"(2) Survey for railway (Raxaul-Kathmandu ) and feasibility study of electric bus service  Rs 0.1 million
"
3027,"CIVIL AVIATION
"
3028,"The importance of civil aviation is providing easy and speedy transportation facilities to the remote and inaccessible areas of Nepal is steadily increasing. It is difficult to provide road transportation facilities in a short pe riod of time to every district in a rugged country like Nepal.
"
3029,"Since a long time is often needed (especially in the initial stages of the construction of roads in the hilly terrans), it has become essential to operate air services in these regions before making road facilities available.
"
3030,"Efforts will thus be continued during the Fourth Plan period to make available air services in those districts which are considered most essential from the point of view of economic, social, administrative and national deve lopment and to eliminate the transport bottlenecks which have been standing as a stumbling-block to the overall development of the country.
"
3031,"These has been encouraging development in the fields of civil aviation in the past few years.
"
3032,"Air service at the present time is not limited to domestic flights and flights to India.
"
3033,"Services are linked to Pakistan, Burma and Thailand illustrating an encouraging entry of Nepal into international air-service.
"
3034,"In this regard, some of the existing airfields will be improved and extended, making the take -off and landing of large jet aircrafts possible.
"
3035,"Some other airports will be modernized and renovated as required and will be provided with communication facilities, aerial navigation instruments and buildings.
"
3036,"Progress in the preceeding Plan period:
"
3037,"Prior to the beginning of the First Plan period, air service was available to only five places in the country. Among these airfields, Kathmandu airport was the only all-weather one.
"
3038,"The remaining four were fair -weathe r are not serviceable in the monsoon.
"
3039,"During the First Plan period, new fair-weather airfields were constructed at seven additional sites: Bharatpur, Dhangadi, Nepalgunj, Dang, Janakpur and Palungtar.
"
3040,"In addition, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) was established in the year 1959 to provide regular air service.
"
3041,"Improvements were also made on the major airfields of the country: Kathmandu, Bhairahawa and Biratnagar. the Second Plan period, the construction of three additional fair	In	-weather airfields was envisaged, but only one in Jhapa was actually constructed.
"
3042,"The other one in Surkhet was almost completed. STOL fields were constructed in Jumla, Jiri and Baglung.
"
3043,"In addition, the airports of Janakpur and Bhairahawa were largely converted into all-weather ones.
"
3044,"Similarly, the improvement of Biratnagar airport and the construc tion of 2,012 metre-long (6600 ft.) cross runway at Kathmandu were almost completed.
"
3045,"The progress achieved in the first four years of the Third Plan in the field of Civil Aviation was in accordance with the plan targets, except for STOL airstrip construction.
"
3046,"The carry-over projects from the Second Plan were also completed during the Third Plan period.
"
3047,"The Tribhubwan Airport (Kathmandu) is being converted into an international airport, and a new 6,600 ft. * 150 ft. long cross runway has been constructed. In addition, a taxiway, apron, car parking area, and terminal building have been constructed.
"
3048,"The old terminal building has been expanded and made available to the passengers of external flights. A new and separate terminal building for interna l passengers has been completed.
"
3049,"The design and estimates of a fire house and a transmitter receiving station were also completed.
"
3050,"During the Plan period Biratnagar, Janakpur and Bhairahawa airports were converted into all-weather ones.
"
3051,"Apart from this, efforts were made to provide additional facilities at Simra, Dang, Jhapa, Bharatpur, Dhangadi and other airports.
"
3052,"In the Third Plan, Rs 70 million was allocated for the development of civil aviation.
"
3053,"Nineteen different projects will be implemented for the development of civil aviation during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3054,"To implement these projects, Rs 161 million has been allocated during the Plan period. In addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will make available a loan of Rs 60.701 million and technical assistance worth Rs 3.535 million for development of the airports at Tribhuban (Kathmandu), Pokhara, Simra, Biratnagar and Bhairahawa.
"
3055,"1. Tribhuban Airport:
"
3056,"The regular service of large aircrafts like Fokker, Caravelle and DC-9s has already begun at the airport. Since such services are expected to be continued in the future, this airport will be converted into an international airport.
"
3057,"The present runway will be expanded to 3,048 metres from the present length of 1,036 metres.
"
3058,"In addition, the internal and external terminal buildings, the control tower, the cargo terminal, the approach road, the car parking areas, the hangar and other buildings will be constructed. In addition, provision will be made for water and the disposal of sewage.
"
3059,"This project is estimated to cost Rs 43.836 million.
"
3060,"2. Pokhara, Simra and Nepalgunj airports:
"
3061,"During the Plan period, new airports will be constructed in Pokhara, Simra and Nepalgunj.
"
3062,"The runway of these airports will be 1,524, 2,286 and 1,524 meters (5,000 ft., 7,500 ft., and 5,000 ft.) respectively.
"
3063,"Simra: Simra airport is the nearest to Kathmandu and has thus become essential to construct it as an alternative to Tribhuban Airport.
"
3064,"In case the jet aircraft cannot land at Tribhuban airport, this airport will be used as the alternative- landing site.
"
3065,"The cost of the major construction work to be undertaken at this airport is to be Rs 29.7825 million during the Fourth Plan period. Nepaljung:
"
3066,"Nepaljung occupies on important place in the development of far western Nepal.
"
3067,"It is not only the main center for importing and exporting in this area, but also the transportation center for the extension of different development projects.
"
3068,"Moreover, it is centrally located between Dhangadi in the west, Surkhet in the north and Dang in the east and acts as an operating base for STOL service in that region.
"
3069,"For these reasons, this airport needs reconstruction and modernization to make it an all-weather one.
"
3070,"It is estimated that Rs 16.045 million will be spent for this purpose.
"
3071,"3. All-weather airport at Biratnagar and Bhairahawa:
"
3072,"The runways in Biratnagar and Bhairahawa airports will be extended to 1,525 meter (5,000 ft.). The approach roads and terminal buildings will also be renovated.
"
3073,"These projects are estimated to cost about Rs 29.51-125 million. During this Plan period Rs 14.756 million will be spent for each airport.
"
3074,"4. Tumlingtar Fair-weather airport:
"
3075,"The construction of a runway at Tumlingtar airport was begun during the Third Plan period in hopes of providing Dacota (DC-3) air service to the Eastern hilly region of Nepal.
"
3076,"The completion of this airport is envisaged during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3077,"For this purpose, about Rs 2,60,000 will be spent in the Plan period.
"
3078,"This airport will provide additional transport facilities to the inaccessible areas of Mechi, Khoshi and Sagarmatha Zones.
"
3079,"5. Improvements and Additional Facilities:
"
3080,"In addition to the above mentioned airports, airfields at Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Jhapa, Plaungtar, Bharatpur, Dang, Dhangadi and Surkhet will be modernized and equipped with staff-quarters, fire- stations, N.D.B., and generator building, etc.
"
3081,"The implementation of this calls for Rs 3,271,525 which includes Rs 775,000 for Janakpur, Rs 465,000 for Rajbiraj, Rs 911,525 for Jhapa, Rs 80,000 for Palungtar, Rs 140,000 for Bharatpur, Rs 130,000 for Dang, Rs 340,000 for Dhangadi and Rs 430,000 for Surkhet airfield. 6. Short take-off and landing (STOL) airstrips:
"
3082,"STOL air services play an important role in the provision of transportation facilities to Nepal’s inaccessible hilly regions, where big aircrafts cannot land.
"
3083,"At present, there are 24 such STOL air- fields in the Kingdom.
"
3084,"The three airstrips at Jumla, Baglung and Lamidanda of Khotang have been constructed by the Department, and two other airstrips at Dipayal in Doti and Safebazar in Accham, are now being renovated by the Department.
"
3085,"In addition, 19 other airstrips constructed by voluntary labour from the local people are now under regulations of the Department.
"
3086,"These include: (1) Mahendra Nagar, (2) Soltar in Kailali, (3) Tikapur, (4) Ghorahi, (5) Dhorpatan, (6) Jomsom, (7) Rampur, (8) Hetauda, (9) Goltar in Ramechhap, (10) Jiri, (11) Ranibas in Dhankuta, (12) Chisapani in Dhankuta, (13) Hardi-Nath in Dhankuta, (14) Kurula in Udaipur, (15) Amtai in Sirha, (16) Rumjatar, (17) Lukhla, (18) Kampughat and (19) Handiya.
"
3087,"In the Fourth Plan 10 additional airstrips will be constructed in Baitadi, Bhajang, Humla, Dailekh, Dolpa, Tribikot, Bhajura, Rukum, Jomsom and one district in Mechi zone.
"
3088,"Jomsom in Mustang, has its own airstrip which simply needs renovation.
"
3089,"This project are estimated to cost Rs 5,520,000.
"
3090,"Airstrips will be constructed only on those sites which are found by surveys to be feasible.
"
3091,"During the Second Plan, it was planned to construct 20 STOL airstrips but the construction of only four such strips was completed. The target of the Third Plan for the construction of STOL airstrips was also revised and the number of airstrips to be constructed was reduced from 20 to 11.
"
3092,"The progress achieved so far in this field is not encouraging.
"
3093,"Therefore, the target in the Fourth Plan has not been ambitious so that it can be totally achieved.
"
3094,"7. Provision of communication and navigational aid:
"
3095,"The provision of communication and navigational aid will be undertaken in this Plan period in order to make air service more secure and efficient.
"
3096,"Such facilities have already been provided in Kathmandu and seven other places.
"
3097,"However, the airfields still need them.
"
3098,"The airfields that have already been navigational aids are not fully equipped at present.
"
3099,"These airfields will be provided with the necessary communication and other materials. This project is estimated to cost Rs 6.9 million.
"
3100,"8. Administrative building:
"
3101,"The need for an administrative building for the Department has been felt for a long time.
"
3102,"Construction of it is planned during the Fourth Plan period, and it is estimated to cost Rs 400,000.
"
3103,"9. Other Arrangements:
"
3104,"Arrangements for the provision of necessary furniture, means of transport, and other machines and equipments for maintenance will also be made at different airports.
"
3105,"For this purpose a sum of Rs 1,386,474 (including Rs 250,000 for furniture, Rs 400,000 for means of transport and Rs 736,475 for the maintenance of equipment) has been earmarked in the Fourth Plan. 10.
"
3106,"Manpower:
"
3107,"Realizing the importance of civil aviation, His Majesty’s Government has made a programme for spending more than 160 million in the Fourth Plan period.
"
3108,"The Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has provided air transport to the remote areas of the country. Although some of the difficult areas have become accessible due to road construction during the last decade, air service is still important as a time -saver.
"
3109,"Since people have benefited by air service (as well as been attacked by it), the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has made a goal to operate additional regular service to the greatest extent possible by further extending its internal service to many difficult areas during the Fourth Plan period. To give essential to the increasing tourist industry of the country, to strengthen individually and to continue mutual co-operation in the international field, there is a great need to improve and extend the external service of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation.
"
3110,"This will contribute especially to the earning of foreign exchange.
"
3111,"In view of these facts, the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation has envisaged a plan to implement the following projects during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3112,"(a) Purchase of medium size Jet planes.
"
3113,"(b) Purchase of STOL aircrafts.
"
3114,"(c) Construction and maintenance of workshop and simulator and purchase of passenger buses.
"
3115,"(d) At present only DC-3 planes are being used in the internal service. In the Fourth Plan period, planes like the Avro 748 will be introduced for internal services, as well.
"
3116,"(e) The existing external services to Patna, Delhi and Dacca will be continued and will be extended to other new places after purchasing some medium size jet planes.
"
3117,"(f) Purchase of some STOL planes and start regular STOL air service to hilly and Himalayan regions like Lamidanda, Rumjatar, Lukla, Namchhe bazar, Doti, Jumla, Surkhet, Saphebazar (Achham), Jiri, Baglung and such other places.
"
3118,"Also, spare parts required for the above mentioned planes will be purchased.
"
3119,"Therefore, the programmes of both the Department of Civil Aviation and the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation need to be implemented in order to achieve the target of the Plan.
"
3120,"It is evident that if the target of one were to remain unfulfilled, it would be difficult to meet the target of other.
"
3121,"Therefore, attempts will be made to implement the projects by coordinating the efforts of the two agencies. Though the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation is an autonomous organization, His Majesty’s Government has given due consideration to its importance and has given it necessary protection and aid many times.
"
3122,"The tradition will be continued during this Plan period as well.
"
3123,"Although only Rs 100 million will be spent by His Majesty’s Government during the Plan period, the willingness shown by His Majesty’s Government in making additional amounts available to the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation and to the provision of assistance and facilities of other kinds have proven to be great support and will remain so in the future.

"
3125,"TELECOMMUNICATION
"
3126,"Telecommunication service was first started in Nepal in the year 1913.
"
3127,"Telephone service between Kathmandu and Raxaul, extending for a length of 110 Km. was established in 1914.
"
3128,"Telephone lines, extending for a length of 518 Km. between Kathmandu and Dhankuta were installed in the year 1936. In addition, a 240 Km. telephone line was installed linking Palpa and Kathmandu in 1951.
"
3129,"Similarly, 25 automatic telephone lines were also installed in Kathmandu in the year 1935.
"
3130,"Another chapter in the development of telecommunication service in Nepal extends from 1951 to 1956.
"
3131,"In the same manner, a 29 Km. long telephone line was installed from Kathmandu to Dhulikhel.
"
3132,"A Central Battery (C.B. )telephone exchange was eatablished in Kathmandu in the year 1950 and telephone service was made available to the general public.
"
3133,"Further extension of telephone lines to a capacity of 300 was completed in 1957.
"
3134,"Wirelessservice in Nepal was started in 1950.
"
3135,"At that time, the service was limited to Kathmandu, Bhairahawa, Illam, Dhankuta and Biratnagar.
"
3136,"This service was further extended to Doti, Dang, Jumla, Dailekh, Sallyan, Okhaldhunga and Rajbiraj in the year 1952 and to Jaleshwar, Ramechhap, Bandipur, Terathum, Taplejung, Dandeldhura and Baitadi at a later date.
"
3137,"Three more such stations were set-up in Baglung, Palpa and Dhangadi in the same year.
"
3138,"Similarly, new stations were added in Pokhara, Bhojpur and Birgunj.
"
3139,"Formerly, telecommunication services were under the Department of Communications, which also had the responsibility of looking after the postal services of the country.
"
3140,"The national development of telecommunication services in a planned, coordinated, and controlled way was started after 1959 when the Department of Telecommunication was established. Present Position
"
3141,"1. With the implementation of the First Plan, new turns in the development of telecommunication service had taken place, not only to meet the needs of administration and security but also to develop different facilities for education, industry, trade and the general public.
"
3142,"Accordingly, an automatic telephone exchange system with a capacity of 3,000 lines was installed in Kathmandu. So far, 1,120 lines, including 120 lines in Singha Durbar have been installed.
"
3143,"2. In the Second Plan period, the construction of different wireless stations started in the First Plan was completed, replacing the 28 existing stations which were out of order by that time.
"
3144,"In addition, 50 satellite stations in different districts and 7 area control stations in Kathmandu, Jaleswor, Biratnagar, Pokhara, Bhairahawa, Nepaljung and Dhangadi were also installed.
"
3145,"An International Telecommunication service was started with the establishment of two circuit to Calcutta and Delhi in India. Also, two teleprinters were installed to excahange message quickly as possible.
"
3146,"In Kathmandu, 12 local centers were set up for the use of the general public.
"
3147,"The establishment of telecommunication stations between India and Nepal was also completed.
"
3148,"Within this period, major work regarding the establishment of telecommunication service between Nepal and Pakistan was also completed.
"
3149,"3. In the Third Plan period, since the existing exchange of 100 lines telephone service proved very insufficient in meeting the demand, an additional 4,000 lines in Kathmandu city and 600 lines in Lalitpur (Patan) were installed.
"
3150,"In Biratnagar, the total capacity of the telephone lines was increased to 400 with the installation of an additional 100 lines. The establishment of the
"
3151,"Kathmandu-Raxaul Trunk Line was also completed as scheduled.
"
3152,"In the Birgunj automatic telephone project, estimates on the installation of internal and external equipment were completed, together with 30 per cent of the construction work on the main building.
"
3153,"The Kathmandu-Calcutta wireless project has been completed ahead of the schedule and the services have been operated on an experimental basis with the installation of all necessary equipment.
"
3154,"By the fourth year of the Plan, wireless stations have been installed in five more districts.
"
3155,"By the end of the Third Plan, wireless services have been made available in about all of the 14 zones and 75 districts.
"
3156,"The annual achievements of the Plan accordance with the targets are given below:
"
3157,"Programmes and Targets of the Fourth Plan
"
3158,"(b) Communication service will be established and extended in different cities as necessary.
"
3159,". 5.1 Kathmandu Teleprinter:
"
3160,"The teleprinter service became necessary with increase in te volume of trade,the development of tourism, increase in the air service, and hotel accommodation.
"
3161,"Compared to wireless services, the following are the additional facilities that are made available by teleprinter services: (1) The exchange of more time during conversation, (2) Conversation which takes place remain in the printed form, (3) Communication of messages is possible in the absence of the other party, (4) Conversations which take place remain secret
"
3162,"The cost of establishing, maintaining, and repairing the Telex system is higher than the wireless system.
"
3163,"In Kathmandu, an International Telex System with 100 lines capacity (which can be increased to 300 if necessary) will be established to cater to the increasing needs for trade, hotel services, tourism, industry etc.
"
3164,"This form of communication service will help to directly increase the revenue of His Majesty's Government by helping in the extension of trade and industry.
"
3165,"In Nepal, Tele -communication services has been expanding at an increasing rate in the last eight years.
"
3166,"The local exchange lines have increased from 300 lines to 5,400 lines, and the number of wireless stations has gone up from 26 to 70. International services have been established as well.
"
3167,"The telecommunication services will definitely be expanding at an increasing pace in the future.
"
3168,"Therefore, it is obvious that many trained people are needed to implement new projects and to continue the services smoothly.
"
3169,"At present, the number of trained people is very limited, compared to the expansion of this service. Naturally it is not possible to implement any new projects effectively or to run the existing services effectively.
"
3170,"At present there is no institute to provide training or study courses in the field of telecommunication, nor is here any programme to establish one in the future.
"
3171,"The problem is to establish a training center in accordance with the needs of the Department.
"
3172,"Training facilities will be provided in different fields according to needs.
"
3173,"The duration of the t raining course will be two to three years. Training will be provided to thirty persons annually.
"
3174,"Necessary funds, in the form of assistance, will be made available for this purpose from the United Nations Special Fund.
"
3175,"The local expenses, on the other hand, will be borne by His Majesty's Government.
"
3176,"Arrangements for training regarding telephone services will be made as a part of the present engineering Institute.
"
3177,"This will reduce the administrative expenses of setting up a separate training center and will enable the Institute to run at full capacity. 5.3 Bhairahawa-Gorakhpur and Lucknow-Nepalgunj wireless service:
"
3178,"Except Tribikot Wireless services have been established in all districts of Nepal.
"
3179,"But, international wireless services and the telex service are conducted only through Kathmandu.
"
3180,"This has put an excessive pressure upon Kathmandu and it has not been possible to make International Telecommunication service as prompt as in other countries.
"
3181,"Because of rising demand, the problem will become more acute. The only solution is to make international telecommunication services available in the Eastern and Western parts of the country through the construction of an East-West microwave system.
"
3182,"At present, there should be direct linkage between Biratnagar and Calcutta in the East and Nepalgunj and Lucknow in the West.
"
3183,"In order to achieve this, it is necessary to conclude necessary arrangements between Nepal and India, and necessary arrangements should be made for the construction and the establishment of telecommunication offices at Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj.
"
3184,"With the completion of the project, it would be very convenient to quickly exchange conversation and promptly deliver messages.
"
3185,"It would also help to generate excess revenue to the Government.
"
3186,"Naturally, it will help the Government in its efforts to increase revenue.
"
3187,"5.4 Local Telephone Exchange:
"
3188,"In accordance with the need to establish telephone exchange projects in different zones and districts in order to meet the need of increasing trade and transaction and expanding industrialization, it has been planned to install local telephone exchange at 13 places: Kathmandu, Lalitpur (Patan), Bhaktapur, Hetauda, Bhairahawa, Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Dharan, Biratnagar, Jhapa, Pokhara, Malangawa, and Nepalgunj.
"
3189,"Out of this, there is a programme to install three exchange projects within Kathmandu Valley, one in the inner Terai, six in the Eastern Terai, two in the Western Terai, and one in the hilly region.
"
3190,"Kathmandu: 5,600 telephone lines (including 600 in Patan) have been installed by the end of the Third Plan. However, it became necessary to install 5,300 additional telephone lines within a decade.
"
3191,"The main reason behind this is the increasing volume of trade and transactions, the activity in social and other sectors, andin the administrative matter of being the capital of the country.
"
3192,"In view of growing number of transactions aand the increasing demand for telephone lines, 5,000 additional automatic telephone lines will be installed in the Plan period.
"
3193,"It will help in the expansion of trade and industry and indirectly increasing Government revenue. It will also provide a facility of the modern era to the general public.
"
3194,"Lalitpur (Patan) Because Lalitpur is one of the three main cities of the Kathmandu Valley, the 600 telephone lines installed at present are not sufficient to meet the increasing demand.
"
3195,"Therefore, 400 additional lines will be installed in the Plan period.
"
3196,"Bhaktapur: Bhaktapur, is one of the other important cities of Kathmandu Valley and is located 13 kilometres away from the city of Kathmandu.
"
3197,"Janakpur: Because of a growing population, an increasing number of trade, transactions, and industrial development in the area, it has become necessary to establish a telephone exchange project.
"
3198,"As the proposed micro wave system will through Janakpur, a telephone exchange project with the capacity of 200 lines will be installed during this Plan period Rajbiraj:
"
3199,"Rajbiraj is also one of the centers through which the proposed East-West microwave system passes, therefore, it has become necessary to install a telephone exchange with respect to population and the volume of trade in this region.
"
3200,"It is , therefore, planned to establish a manual telephone exchange station with the capacity of one hundred lines. Dharan:
"
3201,"Dharan has its own importance from the point of view of its trade, social and industrial development.
"
3202,"As such, it is necessary to install 400 lines to meet the existing demand.
"
3203,"Thus, an automatic telephone exchange project with a capacity to supply 1,000 lines in the future will be installed during the Plan period.
"
3204,"Biratnagar:
"
3205,"Therefore, an automatic telephone exchange with the capacity to distribute up to 5,000 lines, as required, will be installed in the near future.
"
3206,"At the initial stage, it will supply 2500 lines only. Jhapa: Taking into account the volume of trade and industrial expansion, it can be considered to be one of the important centers of the country.
"
3207,"Therefore, a manual telephone exchange station with the capacity of 100 lines will be installed during the Plan period.
"
3208,"Pokhara:
"
3209,"Nepalgunj: Nepalgunj is an important commercial and industrial center in Western Nepal.
"
3210,"To meet local requirements one manual telephone exchange station with a capacity of 200 telephone lines will be established.
"
3211,"Bhairahawa: Bhairahawa is one of the important commercial centers in Mid-Western Nepal.
"
3212,"A telephone exchange with a capacity of 100 telephone lines will be established during the Plan period.
"
3213,"5.5 Kathmandu-Nepalgunj Wireless Station
"
3214,"The target of the Fourth Plan is to operate trunk telephone lines in order to make direct conversation between Kathmandu and Nepalgunj possible.
"
3215,"It will help increase Government revenue, provide facilities for commerce and industry, and reduce some social inconveniences.
"
3216,"5.6 Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Carrier Service:
"
3217,"Considering the growing population and the increasing trade of Bhaktapur city, another of the important centers in Kathmandu Valley, it is now necessary to join the Bhaktapur exchange with that of Kathmandu.
"
3218,"Therefore, a necessary trunk line will be installed to link Bhaktapur telephone exchange project with Kathmandu.
"
3219,"This will help increase the Government revenue.
"
3220,"5.7 East-West Microwave:
"
3221,"Since the existing telecommunication line has proven insufficient to meet increasing demand, it has been deemed necessary to install a modern trunk telephone line. Accordingly, this project is formulated to install a micro wave system which will help to link important centers within the country and also make it possible to establish direct contact with outside world.
"
3222,"Its speciality is the establishment of a system which makes quick delivery of messages and conversations between different parties simultaneously without any wire connections.
"
3223,"With the installation of this project, as in the case of trunk telephone lines, it will help to overcome the deficiencies of the present wireless system in which conversation is possible only between two persons.
"
3224,"It will have 120 channels initially, although necessary equipment will be installed to enable its capacities to be increased to 600 channels.
"
3225,"In the Fourth Plan, a microwave system will be installed in Kathmandu, Birgunj, Janakpur, Rajbiraj, Biratnagar, Dharan, Jhapa, Pokhara and Ghairahawa.
"
3226,"Although allocations for the telecommunication sector have increased by 63 per cent, there has been only a 39 per cent increase in actual expenditures as shown in the above table.
"
3227,"In a country like Nepal, with an undeveloped system of transportation and a rugged topography, the postal service is the most easily available and extensive method of contact at Governmental, institutional, family, and person to person levels.
"
3228,"In addition, the postal service is the only means of establishing contact in most parts of the country.
"
3229,"Furthermore, this sate of affairs is likely to continue for a few more decades. Since the availability of a postal service constitutes an integral part of the necessary development infrastructures, the postal service programme must be implemented as vigorously as in the previous Plan period.
"
3230,"Historical Review:
"
3231,"Historically speaking, regular postal services in the country seem to have originated from the system established by Prithvi Narayan Shah to exchange news which was essential to the process of national unification.
"
3232,"There was no big problem of internal communication between small principalities and states into which Nepal was then divided.
"
3233,"On the other hand, a regular system for the exchange of letters and news from one place of the country to the other became necessary for administrative and national security reasons after unification made the country larger.
"
3234,"Although the postal service was originally established to meet the requirements of administration and national security, it has now developed into a large -scale nationa l system for the service of the people, as well. It has become essential and indispensable for public service.
"
3235,"Historically, the origin of the present post office dates back to the year 1878.
"
3236,"The first postage stamps of 1,2 and 4 annas were issued after the establishment of the General Post Office in 1881. After six years, post card were introduced in 1887.
"
3237,"In 1913, postmen were paid to carry mail all over the country, except for the district of Jumla.
"
3238,"In 1900, (Bairung service), and in 1933, money order services were introduced on an experimental basis.
"
3239,"But these services could not continue for long.
"
3240,"Although postage stamps of different denominations had been issued, there were not, however, for a long period recognized in the outside world.
"
3241,"In order to get recognition of Nepalese postage by neighbouring counties a Nepal-India bilateral agreement was signed in 1936 with regard t correspondence and unregistered mail.
"
3242,"Post exchange offices were established in eight different border areas of the two countries.
"
3243,"Two more important steps in the modernization of the postal administration were taken with the establishment of sub-inspector’s office in 1935 and seven postal circle offices in 1940.
"
3244,"After the revolution of 1950, the postal services were further expanded.
"
3245,"Nepal obtained membership in the World Postal Union in 1956, and about two years later, eight additional exchange offices were established in the southern border areas. Changes were also made in the precious bilateral agreements with India.
"
3246,"The new agreement included some supplementary ones and was made more applicable to the modern world. Since April 1959, Nepal’s international postal services have widened as a member of World Postal Union.
"
3247,"With the aim of increasing the sale of Nepalese stamps in the national and international philatelic markets, the Nepal Philatelic Bureau was established in 1962.
"
3248,"Internal airmail was introduced in 1958 and external air mail in 1959. Instead of the former Postal Circles, Postal Control Offices were organized in seven zones in 1960 in order to make postal administration more efficient and scientific.
"
3249,"The pace of development in the field of postal services has been faster since 1960.
"
3250,"The Postal Training Centre was set-up during the Second Plan in 1962. in the same month, mail service was carried with the help of the third organization (party) and the Indian railways in order to speed up internal service.
"
3251,"The interna l insurance service was started in 1962.
"
3252,"Postal legislation confirming to international regulations and the modern age was passed in April 1962.
"
3253,"Bairung service was resources- started throughout the Kingdom in April 1963. in accordance with the Nepal-India agreement, international insurance mail and parcel service were started in April 1965.
"
3254,"Consequently, the Indian Embassy Post Office which had functioned for the last 150 years was closed down, and the Kathmandu Foreign Post Office was established.
"
3255,"Since it was necessary to set-up a Central Office for carrying the mails to the proper destinations and for the timely sorting of mail coming from surface or air routes, the mail center was established on September 1965.
"
3256,"The Postal Inspection Office was setup in 1966 in order to prevent postal crimes and to settle any case which arises.
"
3257,"A Postal Commodity Store as also established. With the aim of providing a facility to consumers for easy monetary transaction in small amounts, the Postal Order Service was started in April 1966.
"
3258,"A Dead Letter Centre was established in 1968 in order to investigate undelivered mail, to find the proper address, and to deliver it. Expansion of Postal Services
"
3259,"There were 43 postal offices in the country in the year 1883.
"
3260,"After 7 decades, this number had increased to 124 by the beginning of the First Plan period.
"
3261,"During this First Plan, 293 additional postal offices were set-up. Four offices were added in the interim period between the First and Second Plans.
"
3262,"The number of postal offices during the Second and Third Plan period was further increased by 30 and 255, respectively.
"
3263,"Up-to-date of Postal Development
"
3264,"The cumulative number of post offices at the end of the Third Plan and before the beginning of the Fourth Plan is as follows:
"
3265,"With the exception of 20 administrative offices, there are 706 regional (area) offices providing services for the public use.
"
3266,"The total population of the country before the beginning of the Fourth Plan has been estimated to be 11,44,000 over an area of 54,362 square miles.
"
3267,"Accordingly, each postal office is serving a population of 15,643 and in area of 77 square miles, Objectives and Policies in the Fourth Plan
"
3268,"The following objectives and policies have been adopted in the Fourth Plan: (a) to carry out this plan as the first phase of long-term twenty year plan;
"
3269,"(b) to give due priority to the opening of additional post offices in the expansion of postal services;
"
3270,"(c) to take necessary steps in order to make the postal services financially self-sufficient; (d) to emphasize the construction of postal buildings;
"
3271,"(e) to develop the postal-services within a group, making it efficient and capable, although it is included in the general administrative service.
"
3272,"In the Fourth Plan, the policy has been adopted to expand the postal services at the rate of 10 additional postal offices for each government postal office.
"
3273,"Thus in the Fourth Plan, the target has been set up to establish 5 sub-posts, 50 branch posts and 550 additional post offices.
"
3274,"Similarly, 25 postal lines will be expanded at the average rate of 5 per year.
"
3275,"In short, the kind and numbers of the projects to be undertaken during the Plan period are as follows: 1.
"
3276,"Sub post:
"
3277,"The ratio between sub and branch post offices has been determined to be ten to one. This is the same as the ratio between the government and additional post.
"
3278,"But in some strategic areas it has become essential to setup sub-post offices and to upgrade some of the branch offices because of growing responsibility during the Plan period.
"
3279,"Keeping in view all these pros and cons, about 20 sub- post offices are urgently needed. It has been envisaged to set-up 5 sub-posts during the Plan period (or one per year) and to expand them more economically as soon as possible.
"
3280,"2. Branch posts:
"
3281,"In the previous Plan, about 100 sub-post offices were established.
"
3282,"But in accordance with the policy of establishing the less expensive post, during the Fourth Plan, only 50 post offices will be established. 3. Additional post:
"
3283,"Because of the above mentioned reasons, about 550 additional post offices will be established during this Plan period. According to estimates, one post office is supposed to serve for a population of 3,000 to 5,000.
"
3284,"Therefore, the number of posts should be increased considerably, keeping in view the pattern of scattered settlement and the rugged topography of the country. Thus in this Plan period efforts will be made to set up 550 posts.
"
3285,"After completion of three projects dealing with the extension of postal services mentioned above, the total number of postal offices will be 1,331.
"
3286,"The population of Nepal during the Fourth Plan has been projected to reach 12 million. The area of Nepal is 54,362 square miles, each postal office will serve on the average, an area of 41.5 square miles and a population of 9,153.
"
3287,"4. Postal line:
"
3288,"In a country like Nepal with a decentralized administrative system at the local level, the exchange of letters within and between the units via a speedy and direct route of communication is essential for development programmes and administration.
"
3289,"Thus in the Fourth Plan, 25 additional postal lines will be set up in order to set the distance of postal routes.
"
3290,"5. Mail services:
"
3291,"Some portions of the Mahendra Highway, the Prithvi Highway, the Siddartha Highway and the Zonal & district roads are nearing completion. They will be serviceable for all weather , therefore, mail service in 10 divisions will be carried out on a contract basis.
"
3292,"Similarly, in the remote and inaccessible area, new STOL air-fields are being constructed and made serviceable.
"
3293,"This will mean that air mail will be made available in 6 divisions.
"
3294,"6. Commodity Store:
"
3295,"The necessary resources will be made available to acquire papers, stamps, mailing bags, weights and other measures and counter machines etc., which are essential for carrying out the administration of the postal-services.
"
3296,"7. Regional Office of the commodity supply:
"
3297,"The Central Commodity Store, which has to act as a Super Commodity Store in supplying the needed materials for several offices scattered in 75 districts of the country and inside the country and then in storing them for later distribution throughout the country. It has, therefore, been planned to set up regional offices in Biratnagar and in Nepaljung.
"
3298,"8. Commodity Workshop:
"
3299,"The necessity of being self sufficient in such technical goods such as stamps and letter boxes has been recognized, and therefore, a Commodity Centre will be set up in a miniature form, having only limited production capacity.
"
3300,"This will be operated on an experimental basis.
"
3301,"9. Building Construction:
"
3302,"The lack of Government buildings for postal services is one of the major bottlenecks.
"
3303,"Also the available buildings often cannot fulfill the requirements of the area.
"
3304,"This has been creating a problem in the efficiency and skill of administration.
"
3305,"About 80 per cent of the postal buildings are now rented.
"
3306,"Therefore, in this Plan period, greater emphasis will be given to the construction of new postal buildings. Under the building construction programme, about 30 postal buildings will be completed in the following districts:
"
3307,"10. Philatelic Development:
"
3308,"During the Third Plan, foreign currency worth approximately 300,000 was earned by making Nepalese postage stamps available in the national and international philatelic market.
"
3309,"Thus, keeping in mind the growing popularity of Nepalese stamps, the annual foreign exchange earnings from stamps in the Fourth Plan has been projected at Rs 1 million. This will be achieved through the publication of attractive stamps, wide advertisement and publicity, along with the necessary folders, booklets and a complete inventory of the postal ticket collection list.
"
3310,"All of these will add to the national income.
"
3311,"During the third or fourth year of this Plan, two small area offices, one in the east and other in the west, will be opened to provide services to postage stamp collectors from outside and inside the country.
"
3312,"Moreover, a sales organization in the philatelic center of the United Nations will be made through a bilateral agreement with the United Nations. 11.
"
3313,"Training Development Programme:
"
3314,"In view of increased demand for trained personnel in the postal services during the Fourth Plan period, efforts will be made to make the present training system more productive both qualitatively and quantitatively.
"
3315,"The following work will be included under training: 1.
"
3316,"To publish the cirriculum
"
3317,"2. To arranger hostel facilities for 50 trainees.
"
3318,"3. To modernize the postal training Center, providing audiovisual equipment and other needed materials for training.
"
3319,"4. To set up a postal library.
"
3320,"5. To arrange the specially trained and other needed staff for training .
"
3321,"Regional Dead Letter Office:
"
3322,"In the Third Plan, a Dead Letter Office unit was established on a small-scale.
"
3323,"However, this has proved to be failure since it has had to deal with letters from all of Nepal. Therefore, during the Fourth Plan, it has been envisaged to set up two dead letter offices, one in Biratnagar in the east and one in Bhairahawa in the west.
"
3324,"13. Postal Museum:
"
3325,"During this Plan period, one small postal museum will be set up to preserve the valuable, rare, ancient, and historically important documents such as inscription stamps, tools and other related materials. 14.
"
3326,"Service extension and Improvement: order to extend postal services for the public, the following programme will be	In implemented: 1.
"
3327,"15. International Services:
"
3328,"In the Fourth Plan, the following agreements will be signed and services implemented: 1. Entering into two extensive multilateral agreements regarding international insurance letters and parcel services formulated under the sponsorship of U.P.O. and to make such agreements (which had been only bilateral in the preceeding plan period) complete and extensive.
"
3329,"2. To operate postal order Services with India.
"
3330,"3. To establish three exchange postal offices in the three northern or southern border centers for international posta l exchange.
"
3331,"4. To operate money order services on the basis of a bilateral agreement with India.
"
3332,"16. Mobile Inspection Team:
"
3333,"During the Fourth Plan period, it has been envisaged to organize a mobile team consisting of 5 persons whose duty will be to travel regularly and to inspect and make the postal services more efficient.
"
3334,"17.
"
3335,"Maintenance of Continuing Projects: Maintenance work will be continued on projects started in the previous Plan period.
"
3336,"Financial Outlay:
"
3337,"In the Fourth Plan, about Rs 244.51 million will be spent for the improvement and expansion of the postal services.
"
3338,"The details are as follows:
"
3339,"CHAPTER XIV
"
3340,"NEPAL ENGINEERING INSTITUTE
"
3341,"The experiences of Nepal and other developing countries have been shown that the shortage of technical manpower (both skilled and semi-skilled) has been one of the main problems encountered in the implementation of development projects.
"
3342,"As a large portion of total investment in the process of planned development is allocated for construction work, the demand for technicians, trained in their respective fields, will continue to increase. Not only has there been a shortage of technicians capable workers in the construction work.
"
3343,"Because of the unavailability of suitable of workers, many projects have remained behind schedule.
"
3344,"It is thus essential that the necessary steps be taken to augment the number of technicians and labourers, so that construction will runway more smoothly. Since it has generally not been possible to make arrangements for training an adequate nimber of technicians, are being sent abroad for training to middle and low level technicians within the country, significant steps towards that end have been taken in the past few years.
"
3345,"In this process, the Nepal Engineering Institute was established in the year 1961.
"
3346,"Arrangements have been made to provide overseer-level technician training in civil Engineering at the Institute ever since it was set up.
"
3347,"At the beginning of the Fourth Plan, 321 trained persons have already been made available from the Institute.
"
3348,"In addition, the construction of a laboratory building and a student hostel have also been completed.
"
3349,"Training will, therefore, be provided to overseers in the fields of electrical engineering, telecommunication and civil aviation, as well as civil engineering.
"
3350,"In addition to this, the old trainees will also be provided refresher courses and special training in order to acquaint them with modern equipments in accordance with this, the Institute will train the following personnel in different trades during the Fourth Plan.
"
3351,"GEOLOGICAL SURVEY & MINING
"
3352,"Agriculture, forest and mineral resources are the raw materials essential for the industrial development of the country.
"
3353,"Of these three natural resources, investment, time, technical knowledge, and experience are required to a great extent in the development of mineral resources. Instances in several countries have been observed when a major contribution to the economy has been through mineral resources which were able to earn large amounts of money.
"
3354,"The important reasons responsible for the lack of proper development of mineral resources in Nepal have been the very small and unplanned amount of investment made in this sector, and the lack of small and unplanned amount of investment made in this sector, and the lack of expert technical manpower, and the capacity to use modern equipments in mineral exploration.
"
3355,"The proper development of mineral resources of the country would help the industrialization and in the earning foreign exchange could be increased by exporting it as raw material to abroad.
"
3356,"Progress to date Although mineral exploration in Nepal was started during the Rana regime, it was not until the beginning of the First Five Year Plan period that it was done in a planned manner.
"
3357,"However, no remarkable progress has yet been made in this field.
"
3358,"During the First Plan period, a sum of Rs 5 million was allocated for work in mineral exploration.
"
3359,"Among its achievements was the discovery of mineral deposits ‘worthy of being developed’, including iron ore deposits of Phulchoki, Labdi and those copper deposits at Wasa and Arkhaula, and gold on the banks of the Ridi river, and slate deposits at Bandipur. Also deposits of nickel, cobalt, graphite, gypsum, salt, beryl and petroleum were discovered.
"
3360,"The construction of the building of the Bureau of Mines at Lainchaur was almost comleted during this period.
"
3361,"No progress worth mentioning was made regarding the ‘starting in the near future of exploitation of deposits which have already been discovered’ or even of the ‘making of all necessary arrangements before starting exploitation’ as was envisaged in the First Plan.
"
3362,"During the Second Plan, the development of mineral resources was included with the survey of other natural resources, such as forest, soil and hydropower. The target of Second Plan was not as ambitious as that the First Plan with regard to mineral development.
"
3363,"It was planned to undertake a detailed survey of different mineral resources, including pre-investment surveys of the more promising ones,and the establishment of a minerals laboratory.
"
3364,"On the other hand, iron deposits at Phulchoki, Labdi and Those; copper deposits at Baglung, and mica deposits at East No.1 and West No. 1 districts were included for the pre-investment survey. A sum of Rs 1.3 million was spent for the development of mineral resources during the Second Plan period.
"
3365,"The achievements of this Plan period were the completion of construction of the building and laboratory of the Bureau of Mines at Lainchaur, the investigation for petroleum in Dailekh and Surkhet districts, the geological survey of 1,000 square miles, the completion of a preliminary survey of mica deposits at East No.1 and East No.2 districts, and the discovery of new mineral deposits at several different places. During the Third Plan, Rs 20 million was allocated for the development of mineral resources.
"
3366,"A geological survey was to be given top priority during this period. This survey was to be undertaken in search of the basic minerals essential for industrial development.
"
3367,"Among its targets were a pre- investment survey of Phulchoki iron ore deposits; a detailed survey of copper deposits at Bandipur, Illam and East No. 1 and preliminary work in the commercial exploration of the most profitable copper deposits; an investigation for gold on the banks of Kali Gandaki and Rapti rivers; a detailed survey of mica deposits at East No. 1 and West No.1 in order to start commercial production; a survey of the possibility of oil and gas at Piuthan and Chisapani; and a feasibility study of industries based on mineral resources. Until the second year of the Third Plan, work regarding geological surveys and mines was being undertaken by the Bureau of Mines.
"
3368,"It was, however, decided to set up a separate Geological Survey Department, thereby making the two departments responsible for the development of mineral resources. A detailed survey of limestone deposits at Bhainse and Chobar, Magnesite deposits at Kamphughat, Kharidhunga pyrite at Beringkhola and Karrakhola in Hetauda was completed in the Third Plan by the Bureau of Mines.
"
3369,"Placer gold in Marsyangadi and Seti rivers, brine at Lamjung, pegmatite and mica at Lamjung and semi-precious stones in Sankhuwasabha district were also investigated.
"
3370,"In the same way, preliminary studies were made concerning the possible production of dead burnt Magnesite and fused magnesium phosphate from the Kharidhunga magnestic deposits, glass from Karrakhola sand deposit, and sulphur and sulphuric acid from the pyrite deposits at Bering Khola.
"
3371,"Because the first cement factory to be sent up in the country was to utilize limestone deposit from Chobar, detailed investigation work on the Bhainse limestone deposit was discontinued.
"
3372,"Since the Magnesite deposit of Kampughat turned out to be a low grade one, the detailed survey of magnesitedeposit of Kharidhunga has been continued and will be completed by the first year of the Fourth Plan period.
"
3373,"A detailed investigation of lead and zinc deposits of Ganesh Himal is being conducted by a private foreign company under the Nepal Mines Act. It is estimated that 0.25 million tons of ‘Proved’ and 1.5 million tons of ‘Semi-proved’ 8 per cent ore have been discovered by the end of the Third Plan.
"
3374,"The Geological Survey Department did regional mapping of 8,550 sq. miles of different zones including Maha kali, Seti, Gandaki and Lumbini as well as reconnaissance mapping of 3,000 sq. miles. In addition, preliminary surveys were done of copper deposits at Siddhikhani, Illam, Wapsa Khani in Solukhumbu, pegmatite deposits north of Kathmandu and phosphate deposits at different places.
"
3375,"During the preceeding three plan periods, more attention was devoted to attempts to discover new mineral deposit in different areas of the country, rather than to detailed planned investigation of deposits already discovered in different geographic regions of the country.
"
3376,"It could be said that no detailed investigation and evaluation of mineral deposit could be undertaken because of lack of trained manpower, unequipped laboratory facilities, and a program which was inconsistent with the targets.
"
3377,"Similarly, the geological survey was done in a scattered and unplanned way, sometimes resulting in duplication and sometimes in no work at all being done.
"
3378,"Fourth Plan
"
3379,"The objectives of the geological survey are the preparation of geological maps, the systematic exploration and investigation of the mineral resources of the country and the publication of geological data after their collection.
"
3380,"In accordance with the implementation policy of the Fourth Plan period, priority will be given to areas found to be most feasible on the basis of previous studies. Intensive investigation will be limited	to those areas which have been given top priority.
"
3381,"The operational objectives regarding mineral are to conduct the necessary investigation and analysis of mineral resources of Nepal after a thorough study is done with respect to grade and quantity, to make feasibility studies of mineral industries, to cooperate in the working of such industries and to increase the national income by the development of such industries.
"
3382,"In order to implement these operational objectives of the Fourth Plan, preliminary investigation will be conducted on sites found to be feasible by the Geological Survey. In addition, emphasis will be given to the preparation of reports on the mineral deposits found to be feasible by those of preliminary surveys done so far and to the preparation of a study concerning the industrial utilization of mineral deposits.
"
3383,"As surveys and studies in many areas with limited resources are not likely to result in solid achievements, the Fourth Plan will try to make the programmes of the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines more ambitious then previous plans, as well as try to implement objectives with concrete project.
"
3384,"Attempts will also be made to reach definite conclusions on the feasibility of different projects involving investigation of mineral deposits. The tradition of continually including investigation unfeasible project in different plans will be abandoned.
"
3385,"The foreign technical assistance essential for the implementation of projects will be secured.
"
3386,"In addition, modern equipments will be imported in order to adopt new techniques in geological survey and mineral investigations and to expand the laoboratory.
"
3387,"It is hloped that increased investment and efforts in the development of mineral resources during the Fourth Plan period will result in some concrete achievements which will be helpful in the initialization and development of the country.
"
3388,"It has also become essential to coordinate to the maximum possible extent the programmes and operations of the two departments involved (i.e. Geolo gical Survey and Survey, and the detailed Geological-Mineral Survey under integrated Geo-effective.
"
3389,"A separate temporary project office utilizing foreign technical personnel will be responsible for the implementation of Aeromagnetic Survey, and the detailed Geological-Mineral Survey under integrated Geological Minerals Investigation.
"
3390,"Although the Geological Survey will be primarily responsible Fourth Plan this, the cooperation of the Bureau of Mines will also be sought.
"
3391,"A. 	Geological Survey:
"
3392,"1. Western Te rai (Koilabas-Nepalgunj) Petroleum Investigation:
"
3393,"In the context of investigation for petroleum in the Western Terai area between Koilabas and
"
3394,"Nepalgunj, exploratory drilling will be done as well as geophysical, magnetic and seismic studies. This area has been considered to be the most probable site for the discovery Fourth Plan petroleum in Nepal.
"
3395,"This view is also shared by United Nations specialists who have visited Nepal. Preference will, therefore, be given to drilling in this area.
"
3396,"If petroleum were discovered the surplus production could be exported to foreign countries. This could thus make a heavy impact upon the national economy.
"
3397,"Rs 24 million will be spent for this purpose during the Plan period.
"
3398,"2. Arrangement of Preliminary Investigation for Petroleum in Western Terai
"
3399,"(Nepalgunj-Dhangadhi): According to the specialists, the area between Nepalgunj and Dhangadhi is worth investigating, although there is less likelihood of discovering petroleum in this area than between Koilabas and Nepalgunj.
"
3400,"With regard to progress made in the search for petroleum in the Koilabas-Nepalgunj area, preliminary work will be done on this project.
"
3401,"3. Gas Investment in Kathmandu Valley:
"
3402,"The fuel problem in Kathmandu Valley could be partially solved if a gas reservoir could be located.
"
3403,"Even at the present time, limited amounts of gas are being utilized as fuel.
"
3404,"The equipment made available for this programme could be utilized for other projects as well.
"
3405,"A geophysical survey and exploratory drilling will be conducted for this purpose.
"
3406,"4. Phosphate Exploration:
"
3407,"Exploration for phosphate rocks will be done in Lumbini, Seti and Mahakali zones.
"
3408,"The discovery of phosphate rocks could be helpful in the development of agriculture, as it is utilized in the manufacture of fertilizers.
"
3409,"5. Regional Mapping:
"
3410,"Under this project, detailed surface geological surveys of different places Rapti, Bheri, Karnali and Dhaulagiri zones will be conducted.
"
3411,"Since it deals with the preparation Fourth Plan a detailed geological map of the country, it could be considered to be a ‘basic’ for the development of mineral resources.
"
3412,"6. Reconnaissance Mapping:
"
3413,"Under this project, ‘through Scale’ geological mapping will be done in different places in Sagarmatha, Kosi, Mahakali and Seti zones.
"
3414,"7. Other Detailed Geological Survey:
"
3415,"Deposits found to be promising on the basis of geological survey (e.g.
"
3416,"Phosphate at Dharan) will be further investigated in detail in order to utilize them as soon as possible. 8. Research and Preparation of Reports:
"
3417,"Various equipments necessary Fourth Plan ruse in the laboratory will be made available under this project.
"
3418,"In order to increase the utility of data and samples collected in the field in the context of geological survey works, it is necessary to study them in detail in the laboratory equipped with modern equipments is a ‘must’ for the successful implementation of any geological survey.
"
3419,"B.
"
3420,"Integrated Geological-Mineral Survey:
"
3421,"1. Aeromagnetic Survey of Nepal
"
3422,"An aeromagnetic survey of about 128,000 sq. km.
"
3423,"(50,000 sq. miles) of territory in different parts of Nepal will be conducted on contract. Detection of mineral deposits from the surface level alone is often time consuming and neither systematic nor practical.
"
3424,"The magnetic anomaly obtained with the help of an aeromagnetic survey aids in the detection of the presence of iron, lead, copper and zinc deposits. On the basis of such anomalies it is easy to conduct surface exploration in a systematic manner and to give priorities to different areas for further work.
"
3425,"Such detailed mineral exploration and investigations will be conducted at some selected localities.
"
3426,"2. Detailed Geological-Mineral Exploration of Deposits in Western Nepal: Under this programme, 25,000 sq. km. of territory in Gandaki, Dhaulagiri and Lumbini zones will be studied in detail by integrating geological-physical and geochemical methods.
"
3427,"As the well-known old copper deposits of Baglung, Okharbot and vicinity are located in this area, it will be easier, to study the density of deposits, including those deep beneath the earth.
"
3428,"3. Prelimanary Work on Detailed Geological-Mineral Exploration of Deposits in Eastern Nepal:
"
3429,"This is similar to the project envisaged for Western Nepal. Under this Project, preliminary work on the investigation of mineral resources will be conducted by integrating geological, geophysical and geological-chemical methods.
"
3430,"C. Projects Regarding Detailed Investigation of Mineral Deposits and Feasibility Studies
"
3431,"1.Detailed Investigation of Kharidhunga (Sindhualchok District) Magnesite Deposit:
"
3432,"Itwas estimated after the initial phase of detailed exploration, that 1,000 million tons of Magnesite ore (both low and high grade) were present in the deposit.
"
3433,"The work of proving 10 million tons of high- grade ore had mostly been completed during the first year of the Fourth Plan period.
"
3434,"Dead burnt Magnesite to be used for the export and for F.N.P. fertilizers for the home consumption can be produced from high grade Magnesite.
"
3435,"2. Detailed Exploration of Copper Deposits of Bhutkhola (Tanahu District) and Gyaji (Gorkha District):
"
3436,"In the first stage, both deposits will undergo detailed exploration by an application of geological, geophysical and geochemical methods. The deposit found to be most feasible on the basis of the initial exploration will be further investigated, and the grade and quantity of ore will be estimated.
"
3437,"3. Detailed Exploration of Chemical Grade Limestone (Mahabharat Range)
"
3438,"The occurance of chemical grade limestone will be explored in the limestone quarries of Mahabharat Range, and grade and quantity of the deposit discovered will be estimated.
"
3439,"Chemical grade limestone manufacture of glass, calcium cyanide (hetrogenous fertilizer ), and in the production of sugar.
"
3440,"4. Exploration of Pegmatite in Northern Nepal:
"
3441,"Pegmatite found in different localities in Northern Nepal will be investigated in detail under this project.
"
3442,"Until now, the investigation of pegmatite had been not carried systematically and has been done solely to obtain mica.
"
3443,"The proposed project will explore pegmatite, especially in view of the possibility of discovering several other metallic and non-metallic mineral generally associated with pegmatite.
"
3444,"It is essential to utilize the services of foreign specialists in the project because of their knowledge and experience.
"
3445,"5. Detailed Exploration of Copper Deposits of Wapsa Khani (Solukhumbu District) and Siddhi Khani (Illam District):
"
3446,"After a review of studies made already by Geological Survey, a detailed exploration will be done on these deposit by applying geological, geophysical and geochemical methods. Adetailed investigation will follow in one of the deposit found to be more feasible, and estimates of the grade and quantity of ore will be made.
"
3447,"6. Detailed Investigation of Cement Grade Limestone at Bhainse Dhobhan (Makawanpur District):
"
3448,"It has been estimated that there are 8.9 million tons of ‘proved’ and ‘semi -proved’ cement grade limestone at Bhainse Dhoban in Makawanpur district.
"
3449,"After it was decided to establish the first cement factory in Nepal (annual capacity 60,000 tons) at Chobhar in Kathmandu Valley, investigation at this site was postponed.
"
3450,"As it is estimated that the annual cement requirement of Nepal will be 60,000 tons by the year 1975-75, it will be necessary to set up an additional cement factory in Nepal.
"
3451,"In order to meet this prospective demand, a detailed investigation will be undertaken to prove at least 10 million tons of cement grade limestone at Bhainse, and also to make the necessary soil survey.
"
3452,"7. Detailed Investigation of Phosphate Rock Deposits:
"
3453,"Phosphate rock deposits which are discovered by the Geological Survey Department will be investigated in detail under this project. This will include the determination of grade and quantity.
"
3454,"It is an essential project because phosphate rock is essential in establishing a fertilizer industry. Also a deposit of economic grade and quantity may be exportable, thereby earning valuable foreign exchange.
"
3455,"8. Exploration of Miscellaneous Deposits:
"
3456,"Under this project, detailed investigation of deposits already discovered (such as copper from Baglung, Okharbot and Rukumkot) and of other metallic and non-metallic deposits which might be discovered later and which are found to be promising on the basis of preliminary investigation will be further explored.
"
3457,"9. Field Equipment and Machinery:
"
3458,"Equipment necessary for the field work, i.e. heavy and light drill machine (with auxilaries), hand-drill, compressors, trucks, jeeps, survey and geophysical equipment , and camping equipment, will be made available under this project.
"
3459,"As it is not possible to conduct any detailed mineral exploration effectively without this equipment and machinery, this project is an important and unseparable part of the detailed exploration programmes of mineral resources.
"
3460,"This kind of ‘service product’ which includes setting up reinforcing or expanding chemical, mineral, ore dressing, and physical testing laboratories; drafting , duplicating and photo services; repair shops, and a mineral museum and library.
"
3461,"As no work dealing with the development of mineral resources could be implemented successfully without well equipped laboratories and research facilities, this is an essential and important project.
"
3462,"Under this project, technical advice will be made available to small scale mining industries in the private sector.
"
3463,"Industrial development is essential in order to increase production and per capita income at a rate fast enough to provide a basis for the economic development of the country; to decrease the population’s dependence on the agricultural sector; to provide profitable employment for the increasing number of educated persons in the community; and to better utilize the resources of the country.
"
3464,"The industrial feasibility study of forest resources in the country has been started only recently, and it has not yet been possible to fulfill the demand of agro-based industries.
"
3465,"During the Plan period, the Nepal Tea Development Corporation will cultivate tea on additional land in the Terai at Chilimkot and near the East-West Highway in Jhapa District.
"
3466,"Facilities including loans will be provided to tea plantations in the private sector for their expansion.
"
3467,"The aim is to fulfil Nepal’s internal demands for tea and increase exports by the year 1980 by extending tea plantations, including those in NTDC and in the private sector. 3. Industries to be set up in private sector:
"
3468,"It is not possible to speak definitely, as yet, above the industries to be setup in the private sector. Detailed studies have yet to be done in those industries, which have been found to be feasible at the present time.
"
3469,"There is also the possibility that several other industries which have not been found to be feasible at the present time may be found to be so sometime in the future. Taking all these factors into consideration, the target for the establishment of industries in the private sector is as follows:
"
3470,"Note: The above mentioned industries have been only given as examples. License may be issued for setting up other industries which might fall in any of these categories.
"
3471,"4) Industrial Investment and Loans
"
3472,"It has already been mentioned that the private sector is going to be given the main role in setting up industries during the Plan period. It has also been stated that currend legislation wouold be revisede I accordance tiht the policy to set up more industries in the preivate sector.
"
3473,"NIDC would also provide loans according to this policy.
"
3474,"The approximate amounts of loans and investments to be mabe available by NIDC in the next five year is estimated to be as follows: It cannot be said that the private sector will set up all the basic and feasible industries capable of making special contributions to the industrial development of the country.
"
3475,"The Government will attempt to establish paper, fertilizer and cement industries with the aim of gradually selling them to the private sector in the future.
"
3476,"Rs 15 million has been allocated for such investment in the public sector during the Plan period.
"
3477,"The following programme has been included in the Fourth Plan under this concept: a) Completion of work started in establishing industrial centers at Nepalgunj and Dharan.
"
3478,"No design of the production hydro-electric power or the area to be irrigated and distribution system of canals could possibly be done without relevant data on the discharge of the stream, including the periodic fluctuations and minimum amount of water to be available.
"
3479,"Although the importance of such data seems to be somewhat limited at first glance, it would not be an exaggeration to state that hydrological data is the most fundamental data in any project dealing with the development of water resources.
"
3480,"Such data have also been found to be useful in the design of bridges and in the forecasting of floods.
"
3481,"By the proper study of data on sedimentation; dams and reservoirs could be designed in such a manner that they will control “silting”.
"
3482,"The utility of meteorological data is in such divers fields as civil aviation, agriculture, and weather forecasting.
"
3483,"The exploration and utilization of ground water resources in a systematic way can result in large scale increases in agricultural production.
"
3484,"Progress to date To collection and study of hydrological and meteorological data in a systematic manner was not started in Nepal until the beginning of the Second Plan.
"
3485,"In the Second Plan, hydrological surveys were included along with soil surveys, forest resources surveys and mineral surveys.
"
3486,"During the Second Plan, 51 steam gauging stations were built and Rs 2.68 million were spent for hydrological surveying.
"
3487,"In the Third Plan, Rs 14 million were allocated for hydrological survey and included in the Plan under a separate chapter.
"
3488,"The target of the Third Plan was to establish 49 stream gauging stations, meteorological stations, a laboratory to analyze the quality of water and sediment samples, to begin weather forecasting, and to assess the possibility of utilizing ground water resources in Kathmandu Valley and the Terai.
"
3489,"In the revised version of the Third Plan, it was envisaged to start an extensive exploration for groundwater in the western Terai, to continue collecting data on sedimentation, and to start preliminary work on setting up a laboratory. Among the achievements of the Third Plan, there has been satisfactory progress in establishing hydrological and meteorological stations.
"
3490,"Weather forcasting was started durng this Plan period.
"
3491,"Four booklets consisting of the surface water records of Nepal were published annually. Also, one booklet on climatological records of Nepal was published.
"
3492,"But there has been hardly any progress in the collection of data on sedimentation and the interpretative study of this data as envisaged in the Third Plan.
"
3493,"Preliminary data on ground water resources in the Terai area of Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali zones was collected.
"
3494,"A detailed explration of ground water in the Rupandehi district of Lumbini zone (Bhairahawa area) was also started in the final year of the Third Plan with American assistance.
"
3495,"Fourth Plan
"
3496,"The objective of hydrological surveys is to Nepal by collecting data on surface and ground water and making available such data as it is needed in the implementation of development projects in power, drinking water and irrigation. The main objective of the meteorological survey is to make meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, humidity etc) available and to make daily weather forecasts.
"
3497,"The following policy will be adopted in order to implement these objectives during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3498,"The number of stream gauging stations to collect hydrological data will be further increased as needed on a regional basis.
"
3499,"Futher emphases will be put on the interpretative study of hydrological data so far collected.
"
3500,"The number of stations for the collection of meteorological data will also be increased, and data thus collected will be studied in an analytical manner.
"
3501,"1. Surface Water Investigation Under the Fourth Plan, 10 stream gauging stations, 20 crest gauge stations, 10 Stream gauging stations, 10 cable way, 15 automatic recorders, and 15 sediment sampling stations will be established.
"
3502,"In addition, maintenance work on 55 stream gauging stations established in the preceeding years will be continued. 2. Meteorological Investigation:
"
3503,"Under the Fourth Plan period, 193 additional meteorological stations (for measurement of temperature rainfall etc) will be established in different parts of Nepal, and maintenance work on 70 already existing meteorological stations, will be continued.
"
3504,"Weather forecasting will be made more reliable.
"
3505,"3. Ground Water Investigation of Terai Portion of Lumbini, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali Zones
"
3506,"Ground water investigation in Nawal-Parasi and Kapilvastu districts of Lumbini zones, Banke and Bardia districts of Bheri zone, Kailali district of Seti zone, and Kanchanpur district of Mahakali zone will be completed in the first phase of the Fourth Plan period.
"
3507,"It is hoped that agricultural production in the comparatively dry western Terai area of Nepal will be increased with the utilization of ground water developed from data collected under this programme with ground water the crops in this area will not have to depend solely upon the monsoon.
"
3508,"4. Preliminary work on Investigation of Ground Water Resources of Chitwan (Rapti Valley) and Dang Valley This two valleys constitute important agricultural areas of Nepal.
"
3509,"A systematic survey of ground water resources of the two valleys will be undertaken and followed by a preliminary investigation at the end of Fourth Plan period.
"
3510,"CHAPTER XXII EDUCATION
"
3511,"Education plays a very significant role in improving the quality of the population.
"
3512,"The primary necessity in the process of education development is the preparation of the educated manpower required for the all round development of the country and the provision of basic minimum education to the masses.
"
3513,"The experiences and achievements of earlier plans have made us aware of the need to bring about basic changes in the present education system. But it is not possible to bring about changes in the education system in the short run.
"
3514,"It is a long-term continuing process and requires some basic changes.
"
3515,"The following targets in various education programmes are set forth in the Fourth Plan, taking these long-term objectives into consideration.
"
3516,"It is not possible to achieve the necessary objectives within the Plan period because of limited financial resources.
"
3517,"It is hoped that some of the policies adopted in the Fourth Plan will form the basis for future development.
"
3518,"Primary Education
"
3519,"The progress made so far in the field of primary education is very encouraging.
"
3520,"Free and compulsory primary education programmes have been introduced in the village panchayats of Chitwan and Jhapa districts and in 107 other village panchayats.
"
3521,"Fifteen model primary schools have been set up.
"
3522,"However, inspite of this progress, primary education faces a number of problems.
"
3523,"First of all, the number of drop-outs is very high, with a tendency for more drop-outs in the lower grades.
"
3524,"The quality of teaching has suffered considerably due to an inadequate number of teachers in the schools.
"
3525,"The percentage of government aid to the schools reaches a maximum of 93 per cent in some cases, indicating that local resources have not been adequately mobilized.
"
3526,"The lack of adequate finance for other education inputs is quite obvious since more than 80 percent of the revenue is spent on salary.
"
3527,"Considering the above facts, HMG has adopted a number of specific policies towards the development of primary education.
"
3528,"The target of free and compulsory primary education seems difficult to attain in the near future.
"
3529,"The Fourth Plan aims to provide primary education to 45 per cent of the primary school-going age children.
"
3530,"To achieve this target, 7000 additional classes and a smilar number of teachers will have to be improved. In remote northern regions, it is not practical to establish schools on the basis of population, and special provisions will be made to open 250 classes on the basis of distances between villages.
"
3531,"1. 	Financing of Primary Education
"
3532,"So far, HMG has been providing grants to the primary schools according to the number of teachers.
"
3533,"Though the schools spend a majority portion of their income on salary, the salary scale of the teachers is very low when compared to other professions.
"
3534,"As a result, the schools cannot obtain the services of able teachers, thereby making a great obstacle to the qualitative development of education. Keeping this in mind, instead of providing grants to the schools, the Government will gradually provide trained teachers whose salaries will be paid directly by the Government.
"
3535,"The regular grant would become 40 percent of the teacher’s salary in those schools where trained teachers are not available.
"
3536,"The number of trained teachers in the Fourth Plan period would reach 12,300.
"
3537,"2. Building of Construction, Education Materials and Curriculum Improvement
"
3538,"Other programmes for the development of primary education, in the Fourth Plan include building construction, provision of education materials to 2000 primary schools, and improvements in curriculum.
"
3539,"3. Scholarships
"
3540,"To meet the shortage of teachers in the northern border regions, scholarships will be provided to students of those areas to enable them to study in the nearby high schools or training centres.
"
3541,"Secondary Education
"
3542,"There were 22 high and 203 middle schools in the country prior to the year 1951.
"
3543,"With the advent of democracy the development of secondary education has been very rapid.
"
3544,"By the end of the Third Plan, the number of high and middle schools is estimated to be 444 and 534 respectively.
"
3545,"The secondary school enrolment is not 18 per cent o f the primary school enrolment. There has been some improvement in the quality of teaching as a result of the various teacher training programmes organized during the Third Plan period.
"
3546,"The Fourth Plan aims to increase the secondary school enrolment to 20 per cent of the primary school enrolment.
"
3547,"As more of the students terminate their studies after secondary education, the need to emphasize the quality of teaching, rather then the quantity has become apparent.
"
3548,"Therefore, during the Plan period necessary restrictions will be made concerning the opening up of schools and emphasis will be given to consolidation and improvement of the existing ones. 1. 	Financing of Secondary Education
"
3549,"So far, the Government grant is only 20 per cent of the total expenditure of secondary schools, with the remaining 80 percent being borne b the public.
"
3550,"Therefore, instead of the present system of grants, it is roposed to provide 50 percent of the salary of the secondary school teachers in the form of grants.
"
3551,"For this, it is essential that the Educaiton Department make the necessary arrangements for the salary to be paid directly to the teachers.
"
3552,"2. Training in Various Subjects
"
3553,"Intensive training in various fields has been provided to the teachers during the last few years with the objective of making the secondary school teachers more proficient in their subjects.
"
3554,"About 1500 additional teachers will be given short-term training in science, mathematics, English, nepali and social sciences during the Plan period.
"
3555,"3. School Building and Hostels
"
3556,"c. 	Education inspector offices will be strengthened for the regular inspection and guidance of secondary schools.
"
3557,"d. 	Provision will be made to reward teachers with prizes and other facilities of the basis of their work.
"
3558,"A model residential secondary school with a high standard of teaching will be established at Budhanilkantha under foreign assistance during Fourth Plan.
"
3559,"Altogether 470 students will be accommodated in the school, and special provisions will be made to secure adequate seats for students coming from outside the Kathmandu Valley.
"
3560,"Secondary Multipurpose Education Under the present system of education, the requirements of manpower in various vocational areas cannot be met from high school graduates alone.
"
3561,"In the absence of vocational knowledge, they cannot be self supporting and tend to depend on Government jobs. So far, twenty-nine multipurpose schools have been set up to improve this situation.
"
3562,"As the operating cost of multipurpose schools is very high, it is not possible to establish a large number of such schools in the near future. Therefore, during the Fourth Plan, only a few additional multipurpose schools will be established, although separate provisions will be made to include one vocational subject (in grade 9 and 10) in as many secondary schools as possible.
"
3563,"Adult Education
"
3564,"The adult education programme aims at gradually reducing the rate of illiteracy in the country.
"
3565,"During the Third Plan, 1,00,000 adults are expected to become literate, and the literacy rate is expected to reach 11.8 per cent.
"
3566,"The programme has received active support from various Class Organizations. The Fourth Plan aims to raise the literacy rate to 15 per cent.
"
3567,"Some of this increase will be due to the primary education programme.
"
3568,"There are, at present, 37 permanent adult education centres in the country.
"
3569,"During the Fourth Plan , these will be further consolidated and improved and 38 additional centres will be opened.
"
3570,"In addition a special work-oriented adult education programme will be started in Chitwan district with UNESCO assistance, and on the basis of the experience in Chitwan, such functional literacy programmes will be expanded in other areas.
"
3571,"Higher Education
"
3572,"Progress in higher education has been mainly in terms of quantity during earlier Plans.
"
3573,"In comparison to 29 colleges at the beginning of the Third Plan, the number of colleges at present has reached 40.
"
3574,"A high percentage of the high school graduates are enrolled in the colleges with a majority of them taking liberal art subjects.
"
3575,"The higher education programme in the Fourth Plan will be formulated with a long-term view to make it qualitative and more practical.
"
3576,"Emphasis will be given to vocational oriented education at the secondary level in order to control the increasing trend towards the non-vocational type of higher education. Arrangement will be made to allow the students to enter higher education only on the basis of merit.
"
3577,"In order to fulfil the above objectives, the following steps will be taken in the Fourth Plan period: 1.
"
3578,"His Majesty's Government will formulate a specific policy on the expansion of higher education
"
3579,"2. The opening up of new colleges during the Plan period will be generally restricted.
"
3580,"3. Institutions of post S.L.C. standard offering diplomas and degrees in various vocational subjects will be established.
"
3581,"4. An effective policy of science education aimed at facilitating its spread in the colleges will be formulated.
"
3582,"1. Improvement of Colleges
"
3583,"The colleges of Kathmandu Valley seems to attract a large number of students from outside the Valley because of a lack of facilities for various subjects in the colleges outside the Valley.
"
3584,"In order to provide better facilities for higher education on a regular basis, five colleges lying outside Kathmandu Valley will be improved to include most faculties and subjects, with laboratory, library and hostel facilities.
"
3585,"The financial aid provided to the colleges will be regulated by enforcing a set criteria on the subjects studied in the college, the number of students, and the general standards.
"
3586,"2. Tribhuvan University
"
3587,"Tribhuvan University, being an autonomous institution, will implement the higher education development programme in the Fourth Plan in accordance with the policy set by His Majesty's Government.
"
3588,"His Majesty's Government will provide finances for specific improvements.
"
3589,"Teachers Training
"
3590,"The quality of education and teaching depends largely on the efficiency of teachers.
"
3591,"As a primary step towards improvements in education, it is necessary to increase the number of trained teachers in the primary and secondary schools.
"
3592,"During the Plan period, necessary arrangements will be made to provide training to 6500 primary school teachers.
"
3593,"1. College of Education The College of Education established in the yrear 1956, provides I. Ed. And B. Ed. training for secondary school teachers.
"
3594,"3. National Vocational Training Centre
"
3595,"The center gives training in subjects like agriculture, education, home science and industrial trades.
"
3596,"The Centre established in 1966 has produced 206 vocational teachers, 375 diploma holdes, and110 persons miscellaneous subjects by the end of the Third Plan.
"
3597,"During the Fourth Plan a regular two years diploma couse training programme has been arranged to train 500 candidates and to prepare them as semi-skilled technicians.
"
3598,"In addition, in-service training will be provided to 500 trainees in various vocational subjects.
"
3599,"Physical Education
"
3600,"Various sports events are being organized in various schools and colleges, with the objective of improving the standard of sports and developing the health of the students and youths. This programme will be implemented more efficiently during the Plan period.
"
3601,"To fulfil the gap of trained instructors in Physical Education in various schools, emphasis will be given to teacher training. A stadium will be constructed.
"
3602,"Since no survey has yet been conducted on the activities of physical education in various schools of the kingdom, such survey will also be undertaken.
"
3603,"Examination Improvement Programme
"
3604,"Improvement in the present examination system will be done by formulating long-term and short-term programmes.
"
3605,"Steps towards improving the question papers, research on the better methods of conducting examinations, and modern and scientific ways of evaluation will be attempted in this programme. In addition, research will be carried out on various reactions to the examination system.
"
3606,"Science Development
"
3607,"The standard of science education in the primary and secondary schools is very low.
"
3608,"Moreover, teaching of science as not been in accordance with the required objectives. The Fourth Plan aims to improve the curriculum, the training of science teachers, the production of scientific and educational equipment and their distribution, in order to make science education in the schools more useful and practical.
"
3609,"The improvement of the Science Education Centre located in Harihar Bhawan will be improved in order to execute this programme more effectively.
"
3610,"The glass, metal, wood and electrical workshops, established to facilitate the repair and maintenance of scientific apparatus as well as the production of some simple apparatus in future, will be better equipped.. A laboratory in the Science Education Centre for teacher training will be established.
"
3611,"Training will be provided to 500 secondary and 800 primary school science tteachers. The science education development programme (STEP Programme) will be introduced to 50 middle schools during the Fourth Plan.
"
3612,"Janak Education Material Centre
"
3613,"A press room will be constructed and the office building will be extended
"
3614,"Sanskrit Institute
"
3615,"Necessary arrangements will be made for the establishment of the Central Sanskrit Institute to organize research in Sanskrit by coordinating the work of present institutions.
"
3616,"Planning, Statistics, Research Programme
"
3617,"Since educational statistics are of great value Fourth Plan planning, the collection and publication of various kinds of educational statistics on an annual basis for use by general public will be continued in the Fourth Plan.
"
3618,"CHAPTER XXIII HEALTH SERVICES
"
3619,"The economic and social development of the country is possible only with the healthy physical and mental condition of the people.
"
3620,"So, the development of health services has a direct hearing on the economic development of a country.
"
3621,"The objective of health service development is to make available efficient manpower for the development of the country.
"
3622,"The long-term objective of His Majesty's Government is to make health services available as widely as possible throughout the country by utilizing the available limited economic and technical resources.
"
3623,"Health services programmes under the Fourth Plan can be roughly divided into three main categories. These are preventive measures, curative services, and health education and training.
"
3624,".the Plan has given priority to preventive measures since prevention of disease is simpler and less expensive than cures.
"
3625,"In the field of curative services, existing health offices will be improved and strengthed. The training programmes consisting mainly of middle level technicians, will concentrate on meeting the increasing demand for health personnel.
"
3626,"At present, a number of health projects under the Health Services Department are running with separate offices and personnel in every district.
"
3627,"Since this arrangement seems too expensive in view of our limited economic and technical resources, the various preventive health projects will be unified at the central and lower operational levels.
"
3628,"a. 	Zonal Health Office
"
3629,"Zonal health offices have been established in Kosi, Janakpur, Narayani, Lumbini and Bheri zones to prepare the health services programme according to the specific needs of each zone, to provide for the necessary medicine, equipment and personnel for the various health programmes in each zone, and to bring about proper coordination between the preventive and curative services in each zone.
"
3630,"During the Fourth Plan, two new health offices will be opened in Sagarmatha and Gandaki zones, and the existing offices will be strengthened by providing building and other technical facilities.
"
3631,"According to the needs of each zone, 50 to 100 bed hospitals will be provided under the zonal offices, and these zonal hospitals will be consolidated as ‘referal’ centers to the 25 district level hospitals.
"
3632,"b. District Health Office
"
3633,"The district health office aims to extend the health service programme as far as possible in each concerned district.
"
3634,"During this Plan period, district level public health offices will be established in the seven zones referred to above.
"
3635,"c. 	Health Post
"
3636,"The Health Post is the basic unit of health services at the local level. They will be established on the basis of geographical situations, as well as population.
"
3637,"The Fourth Plan aims to establish health posts at the ratio of 1 to 25,000 people.
"
3638,"Depending on the progress in establishing a health infrastructure by the end of the Fourth Plan, 75 percent of the malarious areas of the country will enter the maintenance phase with 25 per cent taken into the consolidation phase. No area will remain in the attack phase.
"
3639,"b. 	Leprosy Control
"
3640,"The leprosy control programme is in operation in Bagmati and Narayani zones. During the Fourth Plan, the programme will be extended to Janakpur, Sagarmatha, Kosi, Mechi and Lumbini zones.
"
3641,"Under this project, programmes of school-health-activities to discover leprosy cases, population surveys, examinations of germs, the establishment of new treatment centers, and the training of auxiliary health workers will be conducted.
"
3642,"Other programmes include reform of Khokana Leprosarium and the rehabilitation of able leprosy patients.
"
3643,"c. 	Tuberculosis Control
"
3644,"During the Fourth Plan, a tuberculosis control programme will be continued in Kabre, Sindhupalchok, Nuwakot and Rasuwa districts of the Bagmati zone and Bara and Parsa of the Narayani zones.
"
3645,"Training on tuberculosis patients will be continued intensively.
"
3646,"d. 	Small-Pox Control
"
3647,"During the Third Plan nearly 5.4 million persons received vaccination against small-pos. in this Plan period, the programme is to vaccinate 80 pe rcent of population and to revaccinate them as necessary in various parts of the country.
"
3648,"e. 	Family Planning and Maternity and Child Health
"
3649,"The main objective of the family planning programme is to raise the living standard of the general public by bringing about a proper balance between production and population growth.
"
3650,"And since the fourth year of the Third Plan, this programme has been intensively operated as the Family Planning and Maternity and Child Health Project.
"
3651,"Other programmes include the training of health personnel of different levels, the construction of necessary buildings, and wider publicity on the values of family planning.
"
3652,"Curative Services
"
3653,"Attempts will be made to bring about greater coordination between the preventive and curative services, although the preventive health service is given in the Plan.
"
3654,"Progress in the field of health services in Nepal during the last few years has been considerable.
"
3655,"At present there are 54 hospitals with about 1875 hospital beds, and the number of doctors has reached 300.
"
3656,"Since a large number of these are centered at Kathmandu and a few other urban areas, the facilities for curative services in other parts of the country are negligible.
"
3657,"At present there are 50-bed hospitals in Butwal, Jaleswar, Pokhara, Biratnagar, Birgunj and Nepalgunj. But they do not posses all the facilities necessary for 50-bed hospitals.
"
3658,"So in the Fourth Plan, all the 50-bed hospitals will be developed into ‘referal’ hospitals, and the necessary technical personnel, apparatus and other facilities will be provided.
"
3659,"Due to the increasing number of patients and the growing demand for hospital beds, the Biratnagar hospital will be converted into 100-bed hospital by providing 50 additional beds, similarly the Rajbiraj hospital will be converted into a 50-bed hospital by adding 25 maternity beds. b. 25-bed hospital
"
3660,"At present, there are four 25-bed hospitals in Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Gaur, and Hetauda.
"
3661,"In the Fourth Plan period, Bhadrapur and Janakpur hospitals will be converted into 25-bed hospitals. The 25- bed hospitals of Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Bharatpur, Hetauda and Gaur will be provided with better facilities.
"
3662,"At present there are eighteen 15-bed hospitals in Ilam, Kalaiya, Dang, Dhankuta, Rangeli, Sirha, Bhojpur, Doti, Taulihawa, Baglung, Sarlahi, Jumla, Dadeldhura, Parsai, Kailali, Bhairahawa, Dharan, and Bandipur but many of them are not functioning satisfactorily due to the absence of necessary personnel, equipment, and other facilities.
"
3663,"In the Fourth Plan period, these hospitals will be provided with the necessary facilities.
"
3664,"The hospitals of Shivraj, Bardia, Inarwa, currently with less than 15-beds, will be converted into 15-bed hospitals.
"
3665,"In the Plan period, there is no programme for establishing new health centres.
"
3666,"The existing health centres and dispensaries will be converted into 15-bed hospitals or health posts.
"
3667,"Training
"
3668,"Special attention will be given to a training programme to execute the proposed programmes of the health services in a more organized and planned way.
"
3669,"Within the Plan period, it is not possible to provide the services of doctors in all parts of the country because of economic, technical, and administrative constraints.
"
3670,"The number of doctors available during the Plan period will, therefore, be sufficient to run the proposed programme of health services.
"
3671,"At present, the doctors are primarily in the curative services. Courses of public health orientation and graduate and post graduate training in various public health subjects will, therefore, be arranged in order to secure sufficient doctors in the field of preventive services.
"
3672,"Some will be sent abroad for specialized training, but only according to needs.
"
3673,"a. 	Nurses Training It is estimated that within the Fourth Plan period, the number of graduate nurses will reach 200.
"
3674,"To reach this, the present intake of 40 students in Nurses Training School will be increased and additional facilities such as a staff building, educational materials, and apparatus will be provided to the School.
"
3675,"Along with the graduate nurses training, provisions for postgraduate training will be arranged.
"
3676,"Special attention will be given to public health nurses training for the running of regional health programmes and other preventive health services.
"
3677,"b. 	Auxiliary Health Workers Training
"
3678,"According to the target to open 225 additional health posts within the Plan period, 450 auxiliary health workers will be needed.
"
3679,"Moreover, since auxiliary health workers have to be provided in each of the zonal offices and hospitals, 150 more auxiliary health workers will be required.
"
3680,"The capacity of the school will be increased in order to organize refresher training courses for malaria inspectors and supervisors working under the Malaria Eradication Programme and for the existing dressers, compounders, and health assistants.
"
3681,"Practical public health training will be provided in two village panchayats.
"
3682,"c. 	Assistant Nurses Midwife Training
"
3683,"The Assistant Nurse Midwife Training Schools at present are running in Bharatpur, Biratnagar and Nepalgunj. They have a capacity of training 15 people semi-annually.
"
3684,"As some 80-85 A.N.M’s can be produced annually from these schools, a total of 400 A.N.M’s will be made available during the Plan period.
"
3685,"But during the Plan period, 900 additional Assistant Nurses Mid-wives will be needed, 500 A.N.M’s will be required for the 225 health posts, 250 will be needed for hospitals and zonal health offices, and 150 will be needed for existing health institutions. This additional requirment will be met by the candidates sent abroad on training under the Family Planning Programme.
"
3686,"Since the Nepalgunj training center does not possess its own building, a new building will be constructed.
"
3687,"d. 	Laboratory Assistant Training
"
3688,"To meet the shortage of laboratory technicians in the country, training was started in 1968 at the local Central Health Laboratory, and in the current Plan period, training will be given to 60 laboratory assistants.
"
3689,"Training will also be given to 500 health assistants and 60 other persons for a period of 3 and 6 months respectively.
"
3690,"e. 	X-Ray Technician Training
"
3691,"There are, at present, 14 X-ray machines in the country, but many of them are not in operation becuae of the shortage of technicians. During the Plan period, emphasis, will therefore, be given to the training of X-ray technicians.
"
3692,"Miscellaneous
"
3693,"a. Epidemiology Section
"
3694,"An Epidemiology section will be created to examine prevalent diseases of the country. This section will be created under the public health section of the Directorate of Health Service in order to make public health administration effective.
"
3695,"b. Health Education
"
3696,"A planned health education programme is important for the successful implementation of health service activities.
"
3697,"The health education programme of the Fourth Plan includes school health education, training, and the production of educational materials. The zonal health education section will also be developed.
"
3698,"c. 	Central Health Laboratory
"
3699,"During the Plan period, the Central Health Laboratory will be developed.
"
3700,"Investigations and research on different kinds of diseases, germs and other public aand health problems will be studied. The chemical examination of foodstuffs and blood will also be conducted.
"
3701,"d. 	Ayurvedic Medicine
"
3702,"In our country where the facilities for medical services are not adeaquate, Ayurvedic treatment  is very important.
"
3703,"According to the policy of encouraging Ayurvedic treatment, attention will be given to Ayurvedic research.
"
3704,"For this, the necessary arrangements for medical herbs and other materials will be made and a few dispensaries will be established in some districts.
"
3705,"To raise the standard of Ayurvedic teaching, steps will be taken towards the conversion of Ayurvedi School into a College. Baidyakhana will be provided with modern equipment for the production and sale of medicines.
"
3706,"e. 	Homeopathic Hospital
"
3707,"A 25-bed hospital with facilities for maternity and child health will be established
"
3708,"f. 	Mobile Medical Relief Team
"
3709,"Medical relief teams will be sent to those areas where proper health facilities do not exist. g. 	Mental Hospital
"
3710,"In this Plan period, the purchase of land and other necessary provisions will be made for the establishment of a mental hospital
"
3711,"h. 	Constructions and Improvement
"
3712,"Some of the hospital buildings will be repaired and some new constructions will be made. Hospitals will be provided with additional facilities.
"
3713,"i. Medical College
"
3714,"The purchase of land and provision of other necessary facilities will be made during the Plan period for the establishment of a medical college in Nepal.
"
3715,"CHAPTER XXIV DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION
"
3716,"There is a need for the adequate provision of drinking water and the proper management of sewerage system for the protection of health and sanitation in the community.
"
3717,"In the absence of such services, there are possibilities of cholera, typhoid, dysentry and other communicable diseases.
"
3718,"Since it is the objective of His Majesty's Government to expand these services as much as resources permit, various drinking water projects have been started since the beginning of planning in our country. The following table shows the progress in this field during the various Plan periods.
"
3719,"It is estimated that 10 million gallons of water per day will be available by the end of the Third
"
3720,"Plan.
"
3721,"The number of drinking water projects implemented by the Government will reach 50, and about 6,00,000 people will benefit from them.
"
3722,"The above figures make it clear that only six per cent of the country’s total population have been provided with piped drinking water with the average per capita consumption rate of about 16 gallons per day. This can hardly be called satisfactory.
"
3723,"The Fourth Plan intends to expand the facilities of pure and adequate drinking water and sewerage which are so vital from the creation of a healthy society. The drinking water and sewerage programmes formulated for this Plan period have kept in mind the existing transportation facilities, and the level of administrative and technical capabilities.
"
3724,"Surveys of the water resources of the country will be conducted and reports on feasible projects will be prepared.
"
3725,"The programmes of drinking water and sewerage for the Fourth Plan have been broadly divided in the following way:
"
3726,"1. New Projects
"
3727,"(a) 	Drinking water: Drinking water projects have been undertaken or are in progress in 12 zonal and 33 district headquarters out of a total of 14 and 75 respectively.
"
3728,"During the Plan period, 37 drinking water projects in district and zonal headquarters and selected village panchayats will be started.
"
3729,"An outline summary of the main drinking water projects to be implemented during the Plan period, the quantity of water available, the number of people to benefit and the cost of estimate are given in the following table:
"
3730,"(b) 	Sewerage System:
"
3731,"In the Fourth Plan sewerage disposal has been given priority in those urban areas where drinking water facilities already exist.
"
3732,"A Master Plan for Kathmandu Valley will be prepared in connection with the long- term planning of drinking water and sewerage with the assistance of the United Nations Development Fund.
"
3733,"Numerous projects that were started during the last Plan remains to be completed during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3734,"A summary of these continuing projects, the estimated production of water, and the number of people to benefit from them is presented in the following Table:
"
3735,"After completion of these projects, the supply of drinking water will be increased by an additional 24,55,200 gallons per day and 1,25,900 additional people will be provided with piped drinking water facilities.
"
3736,"3. Survey and Project Report
"
3737,"With a view to providing drinking water in as many different places as possible, feasibility reports containing project maps and estimated costs will be prepared after field surveys are done. 4. Establishment of Laboratory
"
3738,"A laboratory will be established during the Plan period to conduct the examination of chemical composition of the water, various technical studies necessary to maintain the standard of water, and provision of easy means for the maintenance and repair of different projects.
"
3739,"5. Miscellaneous
"
3740,"Necessary arrangement for the improvements and modernization (e.g. fixing of metres, filteration etc.) and for the repair and maintenance of the existing drinking water projects will be made during the Plan period.
"
3741,"Nepal does not have a very long history of collecting and analyzing statistical data.
"
3742,"Although the tradition of census taking was initiated in the year 1911, the collection of data regarding agriculturel industry and other social and economic matters was started only in the past decade.
"
3743,"Data are already available in the following areas: agriculture and population census of the year 1961-62, estimation of gross domestic product since the year 1964-65, and statistics dealing with export and import since the year 1956-57.
"
3744,"The construction of a new building has also been completed in order to cope with the problems of space resulting from the extension of function and organization of the Bureau.
"
3745,"Fourth Plan In order to make statistical information dependable as possible and to make it available promptly, several projects involving standardization, coordination and mechanization will be done during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3746,"If statistical data of a similar nature are assembled from separate institution or government offices, it is difficult to standardize them; and those using such data may find it very confusing. Also, duplication may arise because statistical data collected by one institution may be collected by another.
"
3747,"Arrangements to control such duplication will be made during the Fourth Plan. Even if the collection of statistical data is done by other departments, computation, coordination and standardization of such data will be done by Central Bureau of Statistics.
"
3748,"Major undertaking of census and surveying will be done only by CBS.
"
3749,"Programme
"
3750,"a. The decinnial census of Nepal will be taken iin the year 1971.
"
3751,"It will be possible to collect more information than was possible previously and to make it confirm to international standards.
"
3752,"Because labour statistics have been lacking, manpower has been difficult.
"
3753,"Necessary questions regarding labour will be included in the census questionnaire to be used in the year 1971.
"
3754,"b. Since agricultural statistics are specially important in our country, it has become necessary to have an agricultural census taken once every decade.
"
3755,"The first agricultural census of Nepal was taken in the year 1961 and was confined to selected villages. In order to make the census 1971 (2028) more dependable, it will be done in the wards comprising 15 percent of the Village Panchayat of the country.
"
3756,"c. 	Surveys regarding the population should be done every two years in order to determine periodic increase in population and other relevant factors.
"
3757,"This will be done in the third and fifth year of the Plan.
"
3758,"d. 	In addition to the programmes mentioned above, the following works will be done during the Fourth Plan period.
"
3759,"(a) 	Animal Resources Survey (b) 	Agricultural Investment Survey
"
3760,"(c) 	Internal Trade Survey (d) 	Industrial Census
"
3761,"(f) 	Family Survey
"
3762,"(g) 	Annual Estimates of G.D.P. 5. In order to have such data analyzed and published as fast as possible, modern computing machines and relevant equipment will be installed n the Building of the Bureau.
"
3763,"The accordance with the aim to increase G.D.P. as much as possible and to extend the infrastructure required for the future development, the Plan has been formulated on the basis of those resources felt to be available. In this process, continuing projects from preceeding Plan periods and new physical targets for different sectors have been given due attention.
"
3764,"Although we are not in a position to project either the amount of growth expected as a result of the programme to be implemented during the Plan or the total investment needed, the average actual increase in G.D.P. has been estimated at 4 per cent annually on the basis of data available at the time of drafting of the Fourth Plan on the following assumptions.
"
3765,"The estimation of the actual increase in G.D.P. generated by the proposed investment has been based on an assumed capital-output ratio.
"
3766,"The estimate of Gross Capital Formation during the period between 1964-65 and 1967-68 has also been made by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
"
3767,"Since this estimate was made on the basis of current prices, it is necessary to convert it to the price level of 1964-65.
"
3768,"A detailed description regarding these sources has been presented elsewhere, but it is estimated that Rs 600 million needed for residential building construction will be available automatically.
"
3769,"No consideration has been given whether this amount will be available from financial institution or from the public sector.
"
3770,"From the above exercise, it is important to think about certain basic factors.
"
3771,"Although necessary policy for investing Rs 3,530 million during the Fourth Plan period have been formulated, the expansion of the financial system is expected to be quite substantial.
"
3772,"In view of increase in credit, deficit financing through loan by the Rastra Bank, and local expenditures to be spent from foreign aid, the purchasing power of currency will increase at a rate greater than total investment.
"
3773,"The National Planning Commission has prepared the following guideline for classification of development expenditure.
"
3774,"This new classification for regular and development expenditure will be followed by Ministry of Finance and will be made applicable from the coming fiscal year 1970-71.
"
3775,"1. All new investments projects except the following will be treated as developmental: (a) 	Defence
"
3776,"(b) 	Police and internal security
"
3777,"(c) 	Foreign service
"
3778,"(d) 	Investment for such projects as construction of monuments, statues, museums and parks meant for the direct benefit of the public.
"
3779,"(e) 	Construction of government building and purchase of equipment for general administrative purposes.
"
3780,"2. Expenditure for major renewal work of continuing projects, except for the above mentioned purposes, will be considered to be developmental.
"
3781,"3. All expenditure dealing with research works, pilot studies and special surveys will be considered to be developmental.
"
3782,"4. Any programme or project whose expenditures are largely recurring, rather than in the form of investment, will be considered to be developmental only if it has direct impact on output and productivity.
"
3783,"5. Investment in and capital loans to other government agencies and public commodity-operations will be treated as developmental.
"
3784,"6. Transfers to other agencies of HMG purposes will be considered developmental only if the end use of the transfer coincides with the above five guidelines.
"
3785,"It is necessary to clarify here that neither all capital expenditure should be considered development expenditure nor all annual expenditure regular expenditure.
"
3786,"Whether such expenditures are to be classified as regular or developmental expenditure depends on the type of programme or project and their consistency with the six guidelines of the Planning Commission.
"
3787,"From this point of view, the following general rules have been proposed for classification of the budget.
"
3788,"2. All capital expenditures will be considered to be developmental expenditure, with the following exceptions:
"
3789,"(a) 	Constitutional organs, viz. His Majesty the King, Royal family, National Panchayat, Auditor General’s Office, Supreme Court, Public Service Commission and Election Commission.
"
3790,"(b) 	General Administration viz. Cabinet, Secretariat of HMG, District Administration, Police, Jails and Miscellaneous Departments.
"
3791,"(c) 	Revenue Administration, viz. Land Revenue, Customs, Excise, Tax,Revenue Tax
"
3792,"(d) 	Mint and Accountant General’s Office
"
3793,"(e) 	Judicial Administration
"
3794,"(f) 	Foreign Service
"
3795,"(g) 	Defence
"
3796,"Parks, Playgrounds, Monuments, Temples, Museums, Zoo, Theater, Archeology etc
"
3797,"(i) 	Central directorates established for the purpose of supervision and direction in the sectors of economic and social services and
"
3798,"(j) 	Metric Measurement Project
"
3799,"3. All recurring expenditures except the following will be considered regular expenditures. (a)
"
3800,"Special kinds of health programmes having a targeted date of completion viz. Malaria Education, Eradication of Smallpox, Tuberculosis, etc.
"
3801,"(b) 	Family Planning
"
3802,"(c) 	Land Reforms
"
3803,"(d) 	Programmes dealing with special kind of survey, pilot study and research.
"
3804,"(e) 	Technical and vocational education and special training projects.
"
3805,"(f) 	Popularization and distribution of agricultural inputs e.g. seeds, fertilizers etc.
"
3806,"(g) 	Agriculture extension services
"
3807,"(h) 	Special area development project like Jiri Multipurpose Project and Trishuli Watershed Project. (i) 	Grants and loans made to financial institutions and development agencies like NIDC, Agricultural Development Bank, Land Reform Saving Corporation, Agricultural Supply Corporation and Nepal Rehabilitation Company.
"
3808,"In the present regular budget there are comparatively few items which can be termed developmental.
"
3809,"Nevertheless, it is suggested that such expenditures be shifted to development side.
"
3810,"In this manner, the following expenditures should be transferred from regular to development.
"
3811,"Present Regular grant No. 27 Education
"
3812,"Capital grants to educational institutions, capital expenditures, scholarships, and student allowances given in educational institutions operated by HMG.
"
3813,"Regular Budget allocation No. 28 Health Capital grants to private heath institutions, capital expenditure in existing hospitals, health centers, health posts and clinics, all expenditures for health training.
"
3814,"Any development strategy for stimulating growth should, therefore, take full cognizance of the spatial dimension.
"
3815,"Development is highly competitive in its locational policies and calls for a conscious regional strategy that promotes redistribution of resources, while maximizing economic growth and national welfare. National development programmes as such offer little scope for analysis and action at the regional level since the analysis relies largely on macro-economic variables and aggregate data.
"
3816,"Also, the sectoral programme may not be well integrated in their locational aspect. The long-term objective of planning, however, is not merely an attainment of broad national targets, but also the development of resources in different regions in order to share the benefits of development as widely as possible without slowing down the overall growth.
"
3817,"Regional development planning is a comprehensive approach towards the reconciliation of economic and social aims, as well as a means of broadening the scope of the allocative processes of the national plan.
"
3818,"Comprehensive regional planning defines national policies with regard to regional economic disaggregation, as well as the integration of local activities and actions for problem areas.
"
3819,"Regional planning provides an important link between the micro-analytical concerns at the local level and the macro-economic objectives at the national level by stressing the coordinative relations between programmes in particular localities and new resources combination for improved land use.
"
3820,"The consideration of the national objectives and regional challenges of national planning indicates a close relationship between national and regional economic planning.
"
3821,"Regional planning is a technique which attempts to accelerate the attainment of the national development objectives and the collection of data for improved planning in specific geographical areas.
"
3822,"Regional planning techniques prevent the scattering of scarce resources in an imbalanced manner by concentrating investment efforts in selected areas.
"
3823,"By concentrating the efforts in judiciously selected areas, regional planners are in a position to incorporate the exact location of investment projects and to link the projects in a logical investment sequence.
"
3824,"The main difference between regional and national planning techniques, therefore, is in the degree of detailed planning.
"
3825,"National and regional growth and development are, therefore, complementary aspects of the same cumulative process.
"
3826,"Regional development policies should be considered as a tool for comprehensive development at the national level, in which all parts of the country contribute in their own way to the attainment of national objectives such a regional approach is particularly relevant to Nepal which exhibits a high degree of spatial diversity and a low economic level, thereby necessitating a careful allocation of scarce resources.
"
3827,"1. REGIONAL DISPARITY
"
3828,"The physical settings of Nepal, encompassing the plains, hills and mountains, yields three broad geographic regions, each with its own distinctive environment.
"
3829,"The Terai Region (including inner Terai) refers to the low-lane lying tropical plains along the southern part of the country.
"
3830,"The Terai, once a harsh zone due to malaria, has since acquired greater economic importance, because of its rich forest an and agricultural resources.
"
3831,"Its comparative advantages in transportation and consequent industrialization has further enhanced the region’s growth potential.
"
3832,"The hill or pahar Region, traversing the sup-tropical belt, has been the traditionally most highly populated zone of the country.
"
3833,"Subsistence agriculture is the basis of hill economy, accompanied by considerably pressure by population on land resources.
"
3834,"The Himalayan Region, including the temperate highlands and trans-Himalayan Bhotea Valleys, has been a marginal area for human occupance because of its harsh environmental conditions.
"
3835,"Population is sparse and the main economic activities are barter trade, animals and some agriculture.
"
3836,"These geographic regions correspond to the altitudinally arranged ecological zones and naturally imply inherent differences in natural endowment.
"
3837,"The regional disparity is amply demonstrated by the man/land ratio among the regions (Table I).
"
3838,"The Himalayan and Hill region converting two-thirds of the total area and supporting 60 per cent of the population have less than a third of the total cultivated area, indicating a heavy pressure of population on limited agricultural land.
"
3839,"Another dimension to this problem is the weak link between the food-deficit Hills (where majority of the population live) and the food-surplus Terai region.
"
3840,"High transport cost discourage retail marketing and inter regional trade so that the circulation of goods and services is dependent upon the large -scale mobility of population.
"
3841,"The traditional circulation pattern of trading with Tibet in summer, when the mountain passes become snow free, and with India in winter, when malaria was less dangerous, has experienced fundamental changes during the last decade due to the malaria eradication in the south and dislocation of trade in the north.
"
3842,"The malaria eradication programme in the Terai has had a particularly important ecological impact on the spatial dimension of the country by strengthening the link with the south.
"
3843,"The former two-way traffic between the north and south has been superseded by the gradual expansion of the southern markets.
"
3844,"The increasing dominance of the Terai (or Indian markets) is not due to rich resources alone, but also to the comparative advantage of the Terai in the field of development activities.
"
3845,"In the present context, the Terai has become an area where development efforts in the agricultural, forestry,and transport sectors have increased rapidly.
"
3846,"The development of transport in Terai has led to increased circulation and concomitant urbanization associated with commerce and industry.
"
3847,"Such an overt emphasis on the economic growth of the Terai may be defined by saying that initial development activities should take place in the regions of greatest potential so that the economic gains of such  programme might be later utilized for use in other backward areas.
"
3848,"But such polarization of development effort would mean neglecting the greater part of the country.
"
3849,"The density of population in  the Hills has reached almost a crucial level endangering the very ecological balance.
"
3850,"The present pattern of development offers no alternative to the further deterioration of the Hills economy to the eventual point when it will become difficult to provide even basic services.
"
3851,"It is indicative of the fact that in the initial stages of development, regional inequality increases more sharply due to a number of disequilibrium effects.
"
3852,"Again, in countries where industrialization is in early stages, the initial establishment of major industries in certain areas leads to a covergence of industries since these nuclei can be self-generating.
"
3853,"This tendency is particularly striking in the case of Kathmandu Valley which has received over one-third of all development projects since the beginning of the planning process.
"
3854,"There are inherent problems in a policy of too much concentration in metropolitan Kathmandu, as well as in emphasizing diverse development activities within the Terai Region.
"
3855,"The Terai may be a lucrative proposition as a newly-opened settlement area for the landless, but what of the future when this “living space” is also used up?
"
3856,"Another problem relates to land use allocation between agriculture, forestry and industry within a limited space of the Terai.
"
3857,"The implications of such a polarization of development can be far reaching in the whole complex of the settlement pattern and population dynamics.
"
3858,"If the migration of the population from the Hills to the lower elevations continues at the present rate one inevitably foresees a rapid depopulation of the hills and mountains, thereby contributing to even larger regional differentials.
"
3859,"A review of development efforts now in operation has been towards accentuating inherent natural differences through unplanned investment.
"
3860,"The excessive concentration of economic and social activities in a few centers implies the desire to maintain the rest of the country as a stagnant residual and to create depressed areas on the one hand and physical urban maladies on the other.
"
3861,"Therefore, the need is shown for regional planning, whereby inherent disequilibrium will be minimized by conscious spatial control of the national development programme.
"
3862,"II. Objectives of Regional Planning
"
3863,"Regional planning provides a comprehensive spatial framework within which locational decision in particular sectors can be taken.
"
3864,"Regional development planning would greatly contribute to the achievement of the following main objectives of national planning for Nepal:
"
3865,"(1) 	Reduction of inter-regional disparities
"
3866,"(2) 	Integration of the national economy (3) 	Breaking the vicious circle
"
3867,"(4) 	Elimination of imbalances among projects
"
3868,"(5) 	Analysis of regional economic structure
"
3869,"1. Reduction of inter-regional disparities
"
3870,"The preceeding section amply reveals the North-South dualism (Hills vs. Terai), as well as the urban-rural dichotomy (Kathmandu vs. other districts) in terms of resources endowment and development efforts.
"
3871,"The policy of balanced development envisaged for the Fourth Plan does not mean pure equalization among regions.
"
3872,"This is neither possible due to differences in resources nor feasible in economic terms.
"
3873,"The aim is rather towards a greater equalization between regions compatible with socio-political needs and financial resources of the country.
"
3874,"The present overt emphasis is in the development of Kathmandu Valley and the eastern Terai does not augur well for the long-term development of the country, since the answer to the question of whether Nepal’s economy will ever reach an acceptable level of development capable of continous growth will depend in large part on the sound economic development of the hilly region which support a large part of the population.
"
3875,"A regional approach does not mean an equal distribution of resources in each and every region, but an initiation of comprehensive spatial planning in representative of regions with good potential for economic growth and the sharing of benefits accured.
"
3876,"Such regional investment patterns could be spelled out in the form of explicit long-term plans through regional development planning.
"
3877,"2. Integration of National Economy The increasing dualism between the Mountains and Hills on the one hand and the Terai on the other is both an economic and political reality, and it is imperative that this differential be minimized.
"
3878,"With the exception of Kathmandu Valley (which covers a more fraction of the hills area), development activities are most pronounced in the peripheral Terai region.
"
3879,"The grain surplus from this region is primarily exported to India, instead of catering to the food-deficit hill areas.
"
3880,"The cereal grains from the Terai should be delivered to the needy Hills, but this is possible only if the Hills have something to offer in exchange.
"
3881,"However, the Hills have very few surplus products to offer because relatively few development efforts have taken place in the hill and mountain areas when compared to those in the Terai. This is the reason why a gradual shift of investment from the Terai to the Hills should be undertaken in order to exploit fully the potentialities of the Hills.
"
3882,"A careful selection of development areas in the Hills would open up diverse possibilities of developing numerous rich resources complimentary to the Terai economy. Such a shift in development effort is also justified by the realization that a large part of the investment made in the Terai are consumed by the Indian . economy because of the close economic relations between the two coterminous areas.
"
3883,"3. Breaking a Vicious Circle
"
3884,"‘The opening of new roads supposedly implies the opening of new markets’. The opening of new markets implies increased economic activity, and hence a higher standard of living.
"
3885,"The above statement indicates that transport facilities are essential for further development.
"
3886,"But it is erroneous to presume that transport facilities alone will “automatically” induce economic progress.
"
3887,"Experience has shown in Nepal that the construction of roads should be preceeded by a through evaluation of the regional impact of the road, as well as simultaneous planning of economic activities in the service area.
"
3888,"The greater the time-lag between road construction and the generation of supporting activities, the higher the economic cost of maintenance and repair.
"
3889,"Therefore, a crucial problem facing Nepal today is the poor position of the economy which does not allow for the construction of major north-south roads, whereas the lack of such a circulation is weakening the economic and political link among the regions.
"
3890,"This realization is significant enough to arrive at the following dual conclusion:
"
3891,"(i) 	Even though the extent of economic activities prevailing in the Hills does not economically justify the construction of major north-south roads, the implementation of these roads cannot be postponed much longer.
"
3892,"(ii) 	The implementation of north-south roads can greatly contribute to the further development of Nepal only if the planning of these roads is complemented by the planning of regional economic activities in the Hills.
"
3893,"The timing and scheduling of the implementation of these latter activities must be related to the completion period of the roads. Hence, the vicious circle of “no economic activity-no road-no economic activity” can be broken by a simultaneous action of road construction and the comprehensive planning of regional economic activities.
"
3894,"4. Elimination of Imbalances among Projects
"
3895,"The elimination of imbalances between various projects depends largely on the scheduling and implementation of independent projects within a geographical location.
"
3896,"Lack of locational considerations in coordinating sectoral activities in Nepal’s past planning efforts is exemplified by the numerous instances of over capacity and under utilization of project e.g. overburdened canals (Pokhara), under used hydro- power (Trishuli) roads with minimal vehicular traffic (Kodari road), and intensive projects without a road link (Jiri).
"
3897,"Imbalances between projects resulting in waste of resources are also to be found in the institutional framework.
"
3898,"In the agricultural sector, for example, the branch offices of various agencies when not located together, create practical problems for the farmer.
"
3899,"Similarly, problem-oriented regional projects like the Rapti Project (resettlement), Jiri Project (Agricultural extension), Trishuli Project (resources management ) have inevitably ended up with accretion of numerous supporting activities.
"
3900,"A comprehensive regional approach at the initial stages would have better equipped these project to deal with totality of their service area.
"
3901,"The feature of imbalanced capacities of projects and programmes is primarily the result of the lack of coordination between projects at particular localities and the paucity of regional statistical data necessary for proper project evaluation.
"
3902,"Regional planning, by providing horizontal spatial dimension to the vertical dimension of the sectoral programmes, would focus on the complementarily among and between projects. 5. Analysis of Regional Economic Structure
"
3903,"There is a great lack of data regarding population dynamics, input-output relationships, trade patterns, savings and capital formation, although these are essential to improve planning techniques both at the national and regional levels.
"
3904,"Moreover, information of national aggregates fails to provide an accurate picture of specific regions. Each regional economy is endowed with a varying amount of physical and human resources and there is an urgent need for evaluating these resources, as well as the market and service industry potentials for the different regions of the country.
"
3905,"The basic obstacles to the development and implementation of regional programmes is the low level of regional information and statistics.
"
3906,"Emphasis should, therefore, be placed on diagnostic survey activities to locate and explore available resources as well as to ascertain potentials and constraints for development.
"
3907,"Regional planning would accelerate the process of assessing the resources and growth potential of the regions by using regional surveys and research studies into land capability, agricultural efficiency, accessibility, settlement pattern and industrial location.
"
3908,"A detailed investigation is selected areas is most relevant to Nepal where there are great variations in the land-form, land-use structure become of sharp contrasts in regional physical complexes.
"
3909,"Such surveys for specific areas in the process of regional development planning would provide insight into the reality of regions and improve the process of development planning.
"
3910,"Allocation of Resources
"
3911,"Regional planning serves the purpose of translating the national planning objectives and package of investment into their regional locational settings so that the different regions and sectors can develop accordingly in order to maximize the effects of the national plans investment potential.
"
3912,"The regional economic policy should be much as to determine the nature of the contribution that each region would make to the totality of national targets and to regulate the pattern of resources use according to the most pressing socio-economic priorities.
"
3913,"In order to achieve a more balanced growth of the nation set out in the plan objective, overt polarization of development should be concentrated by rational regional distribution of investment to affect the growth of different parts of the country.
"
3914,"Regional distribution of resources is an important aspect of over-all efficiency in allocation.
"
3915,"It determines the rate of growth for each particular region and hence also determines the growth of the entire nation.
"
3916,"The present domination of the sectoral approach should be balanced by regional approach in order to quantify the geographical distribution of investment in consonance with the regional policy of off-setting existing disparity among regions.
"
3917,"The regional spatial approach would supplement considerations of the investment sectoral mix with a corresponding locational matrix that would make more explicit the impact of specific project investment on the regional economy and would provide a clearer framework to stimulate and analyze the desirable multipher effects of sectoral investment.
"
3918,"This implies a strong budgetary control for locating specific projects according to rigorously worked-out regional norms with respect to various inputs and production.
"
3919,"Thus, the selection of projects should not be only from the nature of undertaking by sectors but also according to their spatial location on the basis of socio-economic benefit evaluation.
"
3920,"Such an approach calls for careful regional analysis in order to establish those areas which need concentrated efforts to yield greater returns sooner as well as ndertakings.
"
3921,"Once the pattern of public investment is properly established, financial and fiscal inducement or restriction can provide incentives to private investment as well.
"
3922,"It is essential that given region for development has to be shown to contain the most vital of the complimentaries of outlay.
"
3923,"The juxtaposition of a wide range of resources (the Terai, the Hills, and Himalayas) within a common development corridor will permit economic viability and will generate greater inter-regional circulation of goods, services and people.
"
3924,"Comprehensive regional development programmes will be initiated in the following four growth axes (Table 2) during the Fourth Plan:
"
3925,"1. Koshi Growth Axis: 	Biratnagar to Hedangma
"
3926,"2. Gandaki Growth Axis: 	Bhairahawa to Josom
"
3927,"3. Karnali Growth Axis: 	Nepalgunj to Jumla
"
3928,"4. Kathmandu Growth Axis: 	Birgunj to Dhunche/ Barbise
"
3929,"The four growth axis outlined above offer the greatest prospects for the integration and coordination of the different development programmes since they present both the east-west and north- south territorial dimensions of the country.
"
3930,"Each of the growth corridors either has a road or a road is presently being planned or constructed.
"
3931,"These roads will link a series of growth centers where development efforts will be concentrated in order to achieve full economies of scale and to encourage agglomeration economies.
"
3932,"Since these development corridors transverse whole gamut of regional types, the growth centers at specific locations will act as marketing and service centers for the regional population.
"
3933,"The set of growth poles along an arterial link will induce further growth in terms of agricultural transformation, location of industries, trade activities and social services.
"
3934,"The comprehensive development of selected growth centers will act as demonstration areas for formulating development methods best suited to other areas displaying similar conditions.
"
3935,"Thus Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj will exemplify development patterns for the Terai towns while Dhankuta, Palung, Palpa, Syangja, and Dailekh will be models for hilly areas.
"
3936,"In the Himalayan region Hedangma, Dhunche, Jomsom and Jumla will clarify the development procedure for the remote areas.
"
3937,"The objective of developing growth centers is the creation of poly-functional settlements to cater to the diverse needs of the hinterland.
"
3938,"The most important aspect of the growth center approach is the positive nature of polarized development as it takes place and the mechanisms whereby the growth center spreads growth to the surrounding area. That is through the process of multiplier effects, the areas linked to the growth center will gain from the concentrated set of economic activities.
"
3939,"The spread effects may begin to assert themselves from these nuclei of development as the economy fully integrates itself and commodity and factor markets become more efficient.
"
3940,"In locating such growth poles, emphasis should be given to those areas with maximum prospect for radial effects in the peripheral regions.
"
3941,"The four development corridors linking four sets of growth centers, transect Nepal approximately 80 to 100 miles apart with the assumption that their lateral impacts will meet at a certain point in time and thus cover the entire country.
"
3942,"Regional development is by definition a long-term problem. The process of lateral progression will be further accelerated by inter-axial transverse connections such as the Kathmandu-Pokhara road which link into two growth axes.
"
3943,"However, the main reasoning behind the development of growth axes through regional planning is to tie-in the economy of the developing Terai with those of the hilly areas.
"
3944,"In order to maintain and develop the economic viability of the hills and transmit growth from one region to another, it is essential to determine and initiate those activities in the northern regions for which there is demand in the southern regions.
"
3945,"The best way to integrate the national economy is to establish the nature and scope of the complimentarity of the northern and southern part of the growth axis in terms of organic circulation in trade, labour and capital.
"
3946,"V. POLICY FOR PROBLEM AREAS
"
3947,"The development of growth axes offers a basic regional policy in order to articulate inner- regional economic integration in the national planning strategy.
"
3948,"However, a development policy committed to economic growth, as well as social justice, cannot afford to wait for the development corridors to solve all the ills of the present regional disparity.
"
3949,"There is need for concurrent programme for the amelioration of problems of special areas ranging from the depopulation of frontier or marginal regions to the over-congestion in the metropolitan districts.
"
3950,"(a) 	Remote Areas
"
3951,"The mountainous part of the country has limited areas for effective utilization due to high attitude and adverse life.
"
3952,"Most of these Himalayan districts have less than five percent of their total area under cultivation and agriculture can thus support the sparse population for only part of the year.
"
3953,"Again, the decline of petty trading with Tibet, which was a major source of livelihood, has wrought immense economic hardships to these border people.
"
3954,"In addition to these problems, the population residing in these areas is divorced from the mainstream of national life because of its remote location from the development centers of the country.
"
3955,"The important pre-conditions for development of these depressed areas include increasing circulation with their southern regions through transport development and the revival of trade with the Tibetan region.
"
3956,"The concept of the four development corridors including growth centers like Hedangma, Dhunche, Jomsom and Jumla in the Himalayan Region would further contribute to a rational policy for developing similar areas.
"
3957,"The immediate programmes for the mountain areas should be in line with improving the transportation system and providing essential services. Some aid could be given in order to permit only emigration and training of emigrants in the skills required by expanding industries in the adjacent areas.
"
3958,"(b) 	Metropolitan Areas
"
3959,"Urban areas provide another set of problems at a different level.
"
3960,"Urbanization is an inevitable concomitant of development since urban nuclei absorb an unusually large proportion of the savings and capital funds.
"
3961,"That the concentration of activities in the urban areas does not necessarily lead to desirable growth is well exemplified by the excessive congestion and indiscriminate spawling of metropolitan Kathmandu.
"
3962,"Physical planning for urban areas should however be deveopled in the context of a larger regional frame -work encompassing the urban complex within Kathmandu Valley.
"
3963,"The physical development plan for urban Kathmandu should explore into the possibility of involving more private investment. In the action programmes, priority should be given to the problems of housing and sewerage, essential services like drinking water, efficient circulation and tourist and recreational facilities in terms of immediate needs and future needs due to population growth.
"
3964,"(c) 	Depressed Areas
"
3965,"Apart from the North-South (Hills vs. Terai) diversity, there are equally significant inter-regional differences between the Eastern (Kosi), Central (Gandaki), and Western (Karnali) sectors.
"
3966,"This sector is also deprived of the metropolitan advantages as of the Gandaki sector and those of periodic markets, existing in the Kosisector.
"
3967,"The low rainfall and extensive highlands contributed to Karnali’s sparse population.
"
3968,"The terai, as well as the Hills of the far western part of the country, are therefore, compariitively less developed than other similar areas.
"
3969,"In order to develop the economy of the karnali sector, it will be necessary to devise another growth axis for areas not amenable to the main Nepalgunj-Jumla axis.
"
3970,"This supplemental development corridor should be aligned along the proposed Dhangarhi-Dadeldhura Road as a means of effecting economic activities	to support this growth axis. This would be accompanied by a comprehensive development of the Jogura Valley (Inner Terai) in Dadeldhura and appropriate activities in Bajhang.
"
3971,"c) To put emphasis on development of water resources
"
3972,"As natural resources have a prominent part to play in the socio-economic development of the country, the exploitation of this abundant resource is imperative for development.
"
3973,"Of all the natural resources available in the country, water resources occupies the place of prominence. However, it has not been tapped according to need.
"
3974,"Hence, to intensify the allround development campaign of the country, water resources will be mobilized as an important development resource. Various programmes will be taken in hand to develop and expand irrigation facilities and power and drinking water supply services respectively in the interest of agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors that stand to gain direct benefits from the development of water resources.
"
3975,"To tie up the development bases of the country's economy with the mobilization and utilization of the water resource, steps will be gradually taken towards developing power-based transportation systems and inland waterways along with energy-based industries (e. g. chemical fertilizers).
"
3976,"At the same time, special attention will be given to develop it as an exporTable commodity.
"
3977,"A master plan will be drawn up to maximize the use of water resources, which is so abundantly available in the country.
"
3978,"Thus, particular attention will be given to mobilize this resource in such a way as to make it a source of foreign exchange earning of the country, in addition to meeting internal requirements.
"
3979,"A clear-cut policy will be laid down and necessary arrangements made to implement the huge water resources development programmes on the basis of the mutual cooperation of the neighbouring countries.
"
3980,"As such, programmes will be set afoot to preserve and enlarge it. While mobilizing this resource, due attention will be given to environmental aspects also.
"
3981,"Besides, statistical information on water resources of the country will be regularly collected, and their potentialities will be constantly studied and analyzed.
"
3982,"The scope of activities of the existing water and energy commission will be expanded to enable it to play an active role in mounting comprehensive studies on the feasibility of utilizing and developing the almost limitless water resource of the country and on the ways and means of developing alternative sources of energy.
"
3983,"It will also be increasingly associated with conducting proper studies on the economic and legal aspects of water utilization, eva luating project proposals, and re-evaluating completed projects. This commission will be evolved as a competent technical unit charged with carrying out all kinds of studies in connection with the development of water resources.
"
3984,"Institutional arrangements will be made to strengthen the implementation side of the water resources development and to assume full responsibility for detailed designs, planning, construction, and servicing of the approved projects.
"
3985,"(d) To emphasize the development of industries
"
3986,"The infrastructures needed for industrialization are coming up only slowly.
"
3987,"Owing to the low purchasing power of the people, internal market is very small.
"
3988,"As a result, there is very limited scope for the establishment of big industries.
"
3989,"Taking into account the geographical situation of the country and present development status of the natural resources available within the country, the prospects for those large-scale industries to be set up with an eye to the external market do not appear to be very bright.
"
3990,"Such being the case, the industrialization of the country has relied on the opening of small industries.
"
3991,"As the establishment of small industries does not call for a huge outlay of capital, sophisticated technology and modern management methods, they are well within the capacity of our small investors. Tailored to meet the demands of a limited market, these industries can be developed on a large scale.
"
3992,"As such industries are by nature labour-intensive, their extensive proliferation can be turned into an important source of employment.
"
3993,"And if concentrated efforts are directed toward intensive development of those industries, which have proven their capacity to compete in the external markets, they can also become a reliable source of foreign exchange earnings.
"
3994,"Attempts have been made to develop small industries since the previous plan periods. As a result, some success have also been scored.
"
3995,"It is, however, necessary to put in more effort for their extensive development.
"
3996,"The experiences gained so far -in setting them up will be reviewed, and special attempts will be made to remove the bottlenecks and mistakes, wherever found, in order to ensure their steady progress.
"
3997,"(e) To emphasize the promotion of export trade The mounting import requirements have increased the trade deficit and have adversely affected the balance of payments position.
"
3998,"(f) To emphasize tourism development
"
3999,"Tourism is another area, which is growing fast to provide employment to the people and augment the foreign exchange earning of the country.
"
4000,"It holds a good prospect for wide expansion.
"
4001,"Tourism promotion programmes will be made more effective by removing those obstacles that have stood in the way of attracting more tourists and lengthening their stay.
"
4002,"And, steps will be taken for the private sector to make more involved in the investment programmes which helps to develop tourism.
"
4003,"(g) To curb the population growth rate
"
4004,"There is an urgent need to check the population growth, which is taking place at such a rate that can hardly be sustained by the country's economy.
"
4005,"For this purpose, the policies and programmes already devised will be carried out with greater vigour and on a wider scale as well as in a coordinated manner.
"
4006,"Concrete steps will also be taken to stem the flow of immigration.
"
4007,"(h) To consolidate the foundations of national economic integration
"
4008,"The policy which has been framed to promote the growth of different development zones on the basis of their respective natural endowments and development potentials in order to reduce regional imbalances and strengthen the basis of the integration of the economy will be followed in the Seventh Plan period, too, Agricultural, forest and land conservation, and tourism development programmes, in particular, will be launched on a priority basis to foster the productive capabilities of the remote and backward hill areas.
"
4009,"In conformity to the planned objective of providing minimum basic requirements of the people, the policy will be to give priority to and raise the level of investment in these areas for the expansion of drinking water, basic health care, primary and skill oriented education, and rural transport facilities.
"
4010,"(i) To improve management of the economy by decentralizing decision- making and execution processes
"
4011,"It is not possible for the government to shoulder all the responsibilities for economic development, nor is that the proper way to achieve the objective of advancing the economic growth at a faster pace. Excessive concentration of economic decision-making processes and activities inhibits the enthusiasm, skill and capacity of the economic units and limits the development potentials of the economy.
"
4012,"The proper step will, therefore, be to orient the economy in the direction of phase-wise decentralization.
"
4013,"(1) Local Panchayats To try to satisfy all the wants and requirements, whether big or small of all the village and town panchayats scattered all over the country cannot be regarded as practical proposition.
"
4014,"The appropriate thing would be for the local Panchayats as a representative of local people to step forward to overcome the hardship experienced by the local people and to take in hand those small developments works which have great importance in the local context.
"
4015,"The aim of the Act is to speed up the process of development through the medium of popular participation, by entrusting the local panchayats with the task of local development.
"
4016,"In order to realize this objective it is of utmost importance that the administration of the local panchayat units be strengthened and shored up and that their competence to mobilize local means and resources be geared up.
"
4017,"Institutionalized development is not a matter that can be achieved at a stroke.
"
4018,"It calls for a good deal of time and energy.
"
4019,"During the Seventh Plan period, concrete steps will be taken to develop in the village, town and district panchayats the ability to formulate, execute and maintain development projects and to mobilize resources.
"
4020,"(2) Government-owned corporations His Majesty's Government has invested sufficiently in Government owned industrial and commercial corporations.
"
4021,"Still it has not been able to get adequate returns from them, on the contrary, there are some corporate bodies who continue to charge on the government budget even at this stage. They have become financial burdens instead of functioning as sources of revenue.
"
4022,"Excessive government controls and interference in them should be abolished and the managers should be given a free hand in conducting corporation business.
"
4023,"Every corporation should have a clear notion of what the government expects from it. A measuring rod should also be devised to rate its performance.
"
4024,"The performance of each manager should be evaluated and he should be rewarded or punished on its basis. Evolution of such a system of the rod and carrot is necessary in the interest of efficiency.
"
4025,"Practical steps will be taken in this direction during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4026,"(3) Private Sector An atmosphere which is suited to the private sector to play an active part in the economic development has to be created.
"
4027,"As the investment activities of the private sector are determined by the interplay of market forces, attention will be given to make them more competitive and competent For this purpose, government interferences and control in the investment, activities of the private sector and _in the price fixing processes of goods, services and means of production will be kept at the minimum.
"
4028,"Institutiona1 bases that have a direct bearing on the efficient operation of private enterprises will be strengthened.
"
4029,"Special attention will be given to providing support and assistance to those small farmers, industrialists and professionals, in particular, who are eager to improve their economic conditions by making good use of whatever capital, skill, application and zeal they have in their possession.
"
4030,"The economic policies of the government will be tilted in the direction of stimulating savings, investment and productive activities in the private sector.
"
4031,"As the long-term benefits of the consumers are contingent upon substantial increase in the supply of goods and services, the economic policies in force now will be reviewed in detail, and those that impede or act as disincentives to the task of raising production and supplies will be amended as part of the effort to do away with distortions of all kinds. Steps will be taken to evolve an excellent rapport between the public and private sectors.
"
4032,"(j) To strengthen and consolidate development administration
"
4033,"From the experiences gathered over the past so many years it has become quite clear that the pace of economic development of the country cannot be intensified until the development administrative machinery is strengthened and made more efficient. In the absence of such an adminis trative structure, the formulation and implementation aspects of the economic development policies and programmes will continue to be weak and incompetent.
"
4034,"During the Seventh Plan period, top priority will be given to the task of making development administration more effective.
"
4035,"The present organization duties and methods of the government administrative units will be studied in detail, and reformative steps will be taken to make them more capable and dynamic.
"
4036,"Improvements will be made in administrative procedures and financial rules to remove the obstacles lying in the way of speedy and smooth implementation of development projects.
"
4037,"To boost the morale of the government employees, the pay scales and other facilities applicable to them will be upgraded, and the system of giving rewards strictly on the basis of merit will be enforced.
"
4038,"Agencies charged with framing economic and development policies, formulating and assessing development project and programmes, and collecting and processing statistical data will be placed on a firm footing.
"
4039,"Steps. will be initiated to make the analysis of the development projects and programmes more effective.
"
4040,"Similarly, follow up and review mechanisms of project implementation will be made more result oriented.
"
4041,"To this end, planning cells functioning in ministries of His Majesty's Government, the secretariat of National Planning Commission will be strengthened.
"
4042,"ECONOMIC GROWfH RATE AND TARGET
"
4043,"During the Sixth Plan period (1980-85), production levels in agricultural and industrial sectors remained impressive.
"
4044,"Increase in the agricultural production was satisfactory during the period except in the drought year 1982/83.
"
4045,"In the industrial sector, improvement in the supply of electricity contributed to increasing industrial production. Due to these reasons, it appears that over the plan period, GDP will increase on an average by 4.4 percent per year, thus slightly exceeding the overall target of 4.3 percent.
"
4046,"But a caution has to be exercised in interpreting this growth rate.
"
4047,"Hence, if the growth rate is computed by taking the figures from the following _year 1980/81 onwards, annual average rate of increase of domestic product during four years 1981-85appears to be 3.4 percent.
"
4048,"During those four years, productions of agricultural and industrial sectors are estimated to be 3.2 percent and 3.6 percent respectively.
"
4049,"Targets of Production, Investment and Savings in the Seventh Plan:
"
4050,"The Seventh Plan aims at raising the gross domestic product by 4.5 percent per annum. In order to achieve the above growth rate, the production of agriculture sector is to be increased by 3.5 percent and the production of non-agriculture sector, by 5.7 percent annually.
"
4051,"It would be remarkable if the target annual growth rate of 4.5 percent could be achieved in the context of annual growth rate of mere 3.4 percent in the preceding four years.
"
4052,"If these targets were achieved, the-contribution of agriculture sector would fall from 52.4 percent to 49.9, and the contribution of non- agriculture sector would rise from 47.6 percent to 50.1, during the plan period.
"
4053,"An investment outlay of Rs 40960 million. is to be provided so as to increase gross domestic product by 4.5 percent.
"
4054,"The estimated, outlay is based on the estimate that incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) would be 4.2: 1.0.
"
4055,"Out of this total outlay, Rs17550million is estimated to be in govern ment sector and Rs 23410 million, in non- government sector.
"
4056,"Out of the amount to be invested in non-government sector Rs 2000 million is estimated to be in panchayat sector and remaining Rs 21410 million is estimated to be in private sector.
"
4057,"During the Seventh Plan period, the investment outlay will slow down drastically with an annual increase of 3:3 percent only. Though outlay in the non-agricultural sector is expecte to increase at an annual rate of 6.4 percent, this is likely to decline gradually in the government sect6t._ In the fiscal year 1984/85, the share of investment in national prodction was 18.8 percent.
"
4058,"The share of investment is estimated to be 17.8 percent in 1989/90. In this way, increasing share of steadily growing amount of investment has to be fulfilled from foreign balance.
"
4059,"Due to this reason, the share of national saving in GDP will come come down from 10.4 percent to 8.3 as an effect of gradual decline in :national saving. In case of consumption, its share in GDP is estimated to reach 91.7 by an increment of 5 percent annually from 89.6 percent.
"
4060,"These tendencies indicate that there is a greater prospect of increasing outlay through mobilising saving from an increase in GDP. 1 Current prices has been converted into 1984/85 prices by using GDP price index (Deflator). 2 Preliminary estimates.
"
4061,"The growth rate of GDP by 4.5 percent annually shows that there is a greater prospect for the mobilisation of saving. This shows that every possible effort has to be made at the government level for the mobilisation of internal resources.
"
4062,"For a few years, proportion of national saving seems to be on the decline.
"
4063,"Hence, the per capita income is estimated to increase at the rate of 1.8 percent annually during the plan period.
"
4064,"Development Targets of the Seventh Plan
"
4065,"Since the agriculture sector has a decisive role to play in meeting the target of increasing gross domestic product throughout the plan period, top-most priority has been accorded to the development of this sector.
"
4066,"Accordingly, targets are set at increasing production of all major agricultural crops by 4.3 percent by increasing the annual production of cereal crops by 4.1 percent and cash crops by 5.2 percent.
"
4067,"For achieving these production targets, programmes have been formulated to extend irrigation facilities to additional 235 thousand hectares of land, and to distribute 37 thousand metric tons of improved seeds and 396 thousands metric tons of nutrient chemical fertilisers.
"
4068,"Target has been set to distribute agricultural credit amounting to Rs 1504.7 million (net) including Rs 899.6 million through Agricultural Development Bank and Rs 605.1 through Commercial Banks.
"
4069,"If irrigation programmes were implemented according to the target, the irrigation facilities to be provided through government sector would increase by 70 percent and this would increase the total land under irrigation facilities to 574 thousand hectares of land at the end of plan period.
"
4070,"Another priority sector is forestry. It has been quite essential to conduct forest conservation and development activities in war footing in order to eliminate gradually problems of supply of essential materials like fuel wood and timber and to prevent soil erosion.
"
4071,"In this context, it has been targeted to conduct afforestation programme. in an additional 175 thousand hectares of land during the plan period through both government effort and peoples participation.
"
4072,"Effort of afforestation would be five times an much in the seventh plan period as compared to the afforestation of only 37 thousand hectares of land in the Sixth Plan period.
"
4073,"During the Sixth Plan period, it is estimated that average annual rate of increase of industrial production was 10.3 percent.
"
4074,"In the seventh plan period, annual rate of increase in industrial production is estimated to increase at 12.7 percent because of capacity utilisation of industries. already set up in government and private sector, because of commencement of production of industries under construction and because of setting up of new industries.
"
4075,"Programme has been set to provide credit of Rs 2560 million in the form.of financial assistance to private sector entrepreneurs to establish industries and to aid in their capacity expansion and regular operation.
"
4076,"This also includes Rs 120,million to be distributed through Agricultural Development Bank and an amount Rs 540 million to distribute through commercial banks for the development of cottage & small scale industries.
"
4077,"Efforts have to be made for the gradual development of export and tourism sectors in order to lessen in future the dependence on foreign aid as well as to strengthen the balance of payments situation.
"
4078,"For this purpose, programmes have been included in. the Seventh Plan.
"
4079,"Targets have been set up so as to increase income from export sector by 10.7 percent and number of tourist arrivals by 4 percent annually.
"
4080,", Regarding the development of infrastructure, installed capacity of electricity has been more than doubled and had reached 156 megawatts in the Sixth Plan period; The target set for the Seventh Plan is to install additional l07 megawatts to obtain the installed capacity of 263 megawatts of electricity by the end of year of 1989/90.
"
4081,"Regarding the transportation sector, total length of road in the year 1984/85 was 5,950 km. and the seventh plan targets to increase its length to a total .of 7,940 .Km. by an increment of 34 percent.
"
4082,"In case of the construction of suspension bridges, the number of suspensions bridges constructed in the Sixth Plan was 709 and 373 suspensions bridges are targeted to be constructed during the ensuing plan period.
"
4083,"It is targeted to more than double the number of telephone to 40,920 and increase the number of post offices by 34 percent to 2540.
"
4084,"In the education sector, it is targeted to increase the proportion of literate population from 28.9percent to 38.9percent till the fiscal year of the plan period.
"
4085,"Under adult education programme, a total of 276 thousand adults were made literate during the Sixth Plan period.
"
4086,"During the Seventh Plan period, programme has been formulated to make 1.5 million people literate. In the year 1984/85 primary education facilities were made available to 78 percent of children belonging to the age group of 6-10; and lower secondary education facilities were made available to 35 percent of children belonging to the age group of 11-12 and secondary education facilities were made available to 24 percent of the children belonging to the age group of 13-15.
"
4087,"Towards _the development of technical manpower, the target has been set to produce 14,677 students from higher technical schools.
"
4088,"Regarding the extension of health services target' has been set to increase number of hospitals from 80 to 105, number of hospitals beds from),368 to 4,403 and to increase number of health posts from 794 to 1050.
"
4089,"Regarding the extension of drinking water facilities, by the fiscal year of the Sixth Plan, drinking water facilities were made available to 20.6 percent of the total population including 15.7 percent of rural population and 79.9 percent of the urban population. By the end of the Seventh Plan period the facility will be extended to 42.8 percent of the total population including 39.4 percent of rural and 86.5 percent of urban population.
"
4090,"With regard to family planning services, during the Sixth Plan period 1.327 million couples were provided with permanent and temporary family plat1lling services.
"
4091,"During the Seventh Plan period those, facilities will be given a great boost and: there is a target to provide services to 2 million 925 thousand couples.
"
4092,"Allocation of Total Development-Outlay Though the amount to be invested in the public sector is Rs17.55 billion, total development outlay will be Rs 29 billion.
"
4093,"Direct development outlay in the public sector will be Rs 27 billion as Rs 1 billion each will be provided to Private Sector and Panchayat Sector. Of this total development outlay, 65 percent is estimated to be spent in the form of investment.
"
4094,"Total development outlay during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be Rs 50.41 billion, including direct development outlay of Rs 27 billion in the Public Sector, investment of Rs 2 billion in Panchayat sector and investment of 21.47 billion in private sector. Total development outlay is estimated to be allocated to social and economic sectors in public, panchayat and private sectors as follows:
"
4095,"3. Includes total financial assistance Rs 1000 million that is to be distributed by HMG through financial institutions and commercial banks to private sector which includes an amount of Rs 250 million each for industry and cottage as well as small scale industries and Rs 1500 million for the development of agriculture.
"
4096,"An amount of Rs 1003 minion is estimated to be mobilized by panchayats by implementing Panchayats Development and Land Tax and mobilizing local lobour and resources from local taxes panchayat are authorised to collect by such laws.
"
4097,"In this way, an outlay of Rs 2 billion is expected to be made available to the panchayat sector.
"
4098,"His Majesty's Government will provide Rs 500 million and Rs 250 million respectively to Agriculture Development Bank and Nepal Industrial Development Corporation in order to 'provide financial assistance to private sector entrepreneurs to provide support for increasing investment in agriculture & industry.
"
4099,"Besides this, refinance amounting to Rs 250 million will be provided by HMG through commercial banks for the development of cottage and small scale industries in the private sector.
"
4100,"Balance amount of Rs 2l.10 million needed for the investment in private sector is estimated to be met from the savings 'of the private sector.
"
4101,"Investment in the private sector includes the investment to be done by. Government Corporation from their own savings also.
"
4102,"The tendencies that were observed in the balance of trade and pay ment situation during the Sixth Plan period were as follows:
"
4103,"In the first year (1980/81) o,f the Sixth Plan, export increased abnormally by 38 percent due to, favourable climate over the unfavourable are in the. previous year.
"
4104,"Export declined in the two, consecutive. years. Improvement in. the export could occur after 1983/8.4.
"
4105,"But .this improvement was due only to, the increase in valuation price in Nepalese- Rupees in. export statistics as a result of gradual devaluation of Nepalese currency in relation to, U. S. Dollar and inflation in the International Market.
"
4106,"There is no, increase in the quantity of export and bas remained stable over the last 7 or 8 years.
"
4107,"This kind. of status qua is estimated to persist even during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4108,"But inability to, increase export would have serious impact on the balance of payment positioning the Seventh Plan. As. such, during the Seventh Plan period effort has to be done to increase export at a rate of 2. 5 percent per annum at constant price.
"
4109,"A total amount of Rs 11640 million will be accrued from export if the estimated increase in exports were achieved.
"
4110,"Impart is estimated to, increase tremendously during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4111,"To, contains the rate of import within an annual rate of 6 percent at constant price, measures to, adopt are suitable exchange rate, appropriate fiscal and monetary policy, and to, central impart of luxurious goods.
"
4112,"If this increasing rate of import can be limited to, 6 percent, remittances for impart could be contained to, Rs 44640 million. in. the plan period.
"
4113,"The total trade deficit during the plan period will still be Rs 33000 million.
"
4114,"Tourism has remained a principal source of service income of foreign exchange and Indian currency, But during the Sixth Plan period, though number of tourists has increased, a decline is recorded in its income.
"
4115,"This supports the fact that there is a leakage in foreign exchange earning from tourism.
"
4116,"As such, it will be essential to, pay attention to check these leakages.
"
4117,"Special steps will have to, be taken to, make programmes of tourism promotion effective to, increase earnings from this sector.
"
4118,"During the plan period, income from. tourism sector is estimated at Rs 4620 million by increasing earnings at the rate of 4 percent pe r annum.
"
4119,"Other source of service income included during the Seventh Plan period was local expenditure of diplomatic missions in  Since the constructions of big buildings i.e.
"
4120,"'Works of high. cast of diplomatic missions have been completed, now it cannot be expected that there will be further increase in this amount. Therefore, during the Seventh Plan period, income from other service is estimated to increase at a rate of 6.2 percent per annum; making the total amount Rs 12920 million.
"
4121,"Service payment is estimated to increase at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum making the total payment Rs 6450 million.
"
4122,"In this way, net earning from. service income is estimated to be Rs; l1090 million.
"
4123,"During the Seventh Plan period, it is estimated that there will be a rapid increase in payment of interest on foreign loans and at the final year of the plan, annual payment amount will be Rs 330 million. Total payment of interest in five years will be Rs 1170 million.
"
4124,"Since investment income is estimated to be Rs 500 millions, net payment during the plan period' is estimated to be Rs 670 million.
"
4125,"Transfer income will increase at a rate of 2.5 percent per annum and transfer payment will increase at a rate of 10 percent per annum by bringing in an amount of Rs 3940 million net total income from this sector.
"
4126,"Transfer income mainly includes remittance received from Nepalese working in foreign countries and transfer payment mainly includes income that foreign contractors send to their countries through earning in .
"
4127,"Though there has been investment in net service and transfer income, trade deficit has increased tremendously and as a consequence deficit in current account will increase at a rate of 9.2 percent per annum, making annual deficit of amount Rs 4410 million at the final year (1989/90) of the Seventh Plan. This was estimated to be Rs 2840 million at the final year 1984/85 of the Sixth Plan.
"
4128,"Total deficit amount of current account during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be Rs 18640 million.
"
4129,"During the Seventh Plan period, the total foreign aid that will be received is estimated to be Rs 20480 million including grant assistance of Rs 10400 million and loan assistance of Rs 10080 million.
"
4130,"As principal to be paid during the period will be Rs 820 millions, net foreign aid to be recovered will be Rs 19660 million.
"
4131,"This amount will enable to meet the deficit of Rs 18640 million of current account making it surplus of Rs l020 million in balance of payments.
"
4132,"Foreign exchange reserve in Nepal Rastra Bank seems to be increased by Rs I billion by the fiscal year 1989/90 so as to meet import expenditure of at least four months.
"
4133,"As such, balance of payment surplus of Rs I billion is essential during the plan period. Favourable or unfavourable balance of payment position in the Seventh Plan period depends mainly on whether or not income from export & tourism could be increased by 2.5 percent per annum and 4 percent per annum respectively and whether or not the rate of increase of import could be contained at 6 percent per annum.
"
4134,"These growth rates are projected at constant price of 1984/85.
"
4135,"Since price rise is estimated to: be 8 percent per annum, export & tourism earnings at current price have to be increased at annual rate of 10.7 percent and 12.3 percent respectively, and an annual rate of increase of import have to be contained at 14.5 percent.
"
4136,"If these could not be done, hurdles will appear in development process due to balance of payment crisis.
"
4137,"CHAPTER 4
"
4138,"PUBLIC SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES AND PROVISION OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES
"
4139,"Since the beginning of the Sixth Plan, scarcity of domestic resources has emerged as a main obstacle in expanding the public sector investment programmes.
"
4140,"The amount of revenue surplus necessary for financing development expenditures had been on the decline due to the fast expansion of regular expenditures on the one hand and the failure of revenue growth rates to surpass the regular expenditure on the other.
"
4141,"If this trend of revenue earnings and regular expenditures is to persist, the surplus is bound to become negative in the Seventh Plan.
"
4142,"Because of the difficult government finance situation, the growth rate of development expenditures has been nominal since the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, and even has decreased in terms of constant prices. In this context, it has become imperative to adopt effective features to ,mobilise increasing resources to meet the public sector development outlays in the Seventh Plan.
"
4143,"Size of Development Outlay and Sources of Finance
"
4144,"In the context of the emerging financial situation, the size of the public sector development outlay has been limited to Rs 29 billion for the Seventh Plan Period.
"
4145,"The need to limit the size of development outlay has been dictated mainly by three factors. Firstly, the presently apparent indications of the slow growth rate of revenue generation points out the failure to take timely corrective measures in accelerating the growth of revenue generation.
"
4146,"Though corrective measures have been taken presently, many years will have to be spent before the results are expected from these measures, and hence a significant achievement cannot be expected in the plan period.
"
4147,"Second is the uncontrolled growth of regular expenditure.
"
4148,"With the increase in the number of completed projects along with their cost of repair and - maintenance in regular expenditure is not unnatural It is essential to make adequate provisions for repair and maintenance.
"
4149,"But it is not the only cause for the increase in the regular expenditure. Regular budget has not made adequate provisions for the repair and maintenance of projects, and implementation and maintenance cost of many regular works have been met from development budget.
"
4150,"Specially due to the raise in the salary scales towards the end of the(Sixth)Plan period, the administrative expenses have been enormous and it will be difficult to check the increase of regular expenditure if the trend of overstaffing continues.
"
4151,"Unless efforts are made to install cost-effective administrative machinery it will be very difficult to check this increase.
"
4152,"Another cause for this increase in regular expenditure is the increasing burden of loan and interest repayment of domestic and external loans.
"
4153,"In the Seventh Plan period, this kind of expenses is estimated to be Rs 4.79 billion at constant prices, which amounts to 25 percent of estimated total regular expenditure.
"
4154,"Due to all these causes, immense cut in the regular expenditure is unlikely in the Seventh Plan period
"
4155,"The third reason that necessitated to curtail the size of development outlay is the inability of the economy to utilise all available foreign aid. Though emphasis has been laid from time to time to enhance absorptive capacity, we have not succeeded enough in this front.
"
4156,"As it will be unrealistic to seek the use of foreign aid beyond the absorptive capacity, the size of development expenditure has been limited from this view point also.
"
4157,"In determining the size of development expenditure of Rs 29, billion for the Seventh Plan, it has been assumed that appropriate measures will be taken in these three areas-mobilisation of revenue, control of regular expenditure and improvement in the absorptive capacity.
"
4158,"It has been estimated that Rs 22.06 billion at constant prices will be collected as revenue during the plan period assuming the average annual growth rate of revenue to be 4.4 percent due to the expansion of economic activities in the Seventh Plan period.
"
4159,"The regular expenditure will grow annually by 7.1 Jpercent and will amount to Rs 18.79 billion.
"
4160,"Thus the revenue surplus of Rs 3.09 billion will be available to meet development expenditures.
"
4161,"It has been projected that Rs 20 48 billion of foreign aid would be utilized as a result of the gradual strengthening of the development administration.
"
4162,"In terms of resources, Rs 2.57 billion will be available from these two sources, thus constituting 81.3 percent of total development expenditure of Rs 29 billIon.
"
4163,"Deficit of Rs 5.43 billion (18.7 percent of development expendiure) has to be mobilised through the proper combination of measures like mobilisation of additional revenue and raising of internal loan.
"
4164,"As adequate revenue could not be mobilised, deficit financing was adopted since 1981/82. As a result, country's balance of payments position and domestic prices deteriorated, culminating in serious economic difficulties.
"
4165,"Efforts have been made to curtail th_ amount of deficit finance since 1983/84, but without any success and the cut in deficit financing has been at the cost of development expenditure.
"
4166,"Greater reliance cannot be placed on internal loan due to three reasons. First, loan mostly from the banking sector has an expansionary effect on the money supply and adversely affects the domestic and external economic balance.
"
4167,"Second since this measure calls for competition with private sector for financial resources, it goes contrary to the objective of the plan to encourge private sector participation in economic development.
"
4168,"Third, tax revenue and loan have different impact on the budget.
"
4169,"The tax revenue has not to be refunded whereas the amount mobilised from loan has. to be paid back along with interest.
"
4170,"Keeping in view the increasing burden of debt services in the regular budget, financing through loans should be viewed only as a temporary measure to meet short term financial needs. Even at present the annual amount of internal loan that the government raises is very high compared to the annual revenue (It is estimated to be 35 percent in 1984/85).
"
4171,"Keeping this in view policies of permanent nature in mq.bilising additional revenue and ,in gradually lessening reliance on internal loan are to be adopted to meet the deficit of the development outlys in the Seventh Plan.
"
4172,"Accordingly, Rs 1.93 billion will be realised by changes in the tax policies and by strengthening the tax administration and the balance amount of Rs 3.50 billion to be raised in the form of internal loans.
"
4173,"Proposed loan amount for the Seventh Plan is to be very minimal in comparision with such loan raised during the Sixth Plan period.
"
4174,"Of the proposed loan amount, Rs 2.50 billion will be raised from the banking sector and Rs 1.00 billion from non-banking sectors.
"
4175,"According to the forecast, development outlays will increase only by I . 8 percent annually and will amount merely to Rs 6.00 billion in the last year of the plan from Rs 5.50 billion in 1984/85.
"
4176,"Thus only Rs 0.50 billion will be an increment ip. the development outlay within the five years of the Plan.
"
4177,"Main reasons for die need to limit the development outlays are due to the need to meet increasing regular experditure from the additional revenue generated from regular growth and from new measures and due to the necessity of gradually curtailing the amount of internal loan.
"
4178,"Another signlicant change in the financial position that the forecast indicated is the growth of foreign aid component from 61 to 70 percent in the plan period and the need to allocate significant part of additional scarde internal resources to meet the additional HMG contribution to utilise this foreign aid (on the supposition that the proportion of HMG contribution for the utilisation of foreign aid is 1.00 = 0.22).
"
4179,"As such development programmes to be implemented from HMG's own resources have to be curtailed
"
4180,"Mobilisation of Internal resources Great efforts have to be made for the mobilisation of additional resources to meet the deficit internal resources for the public sector development outlay in the Seventh Plan.
"
4181,"Specifically following measures have to be adopted: The base of the tax revenue is very narrow.
"
4182,"Custom duties collected on the imported goods and sales tax have remained the main source of revenue.
"
4183,"As tax revenue is mainly dependent on imports, it has made it difficult to remodel the import policy suitable to the country's economic development and to frame a firm revenue structure.
"
4184,"Therefore, a need to explore alternative sources of revenue to enhance the level of internal, resources is more clearly felt.
"
4185,"Though agriculture is the main source of gross domestic product, mobilisationof resources from this source has not been adequately done.
"
4186,"No revision has been brought in the rates of land revenue since the last seventeen years. Because of large scale concession annual revenue collection of Rs 0.12 billion in the Fifth Plan period has declined recently to Rs 0.08 billion.
"
4187,"To moblilse more resources from agricultural sector, measures like revision of the rates and of structure of rent the identification of appropriate medium of direct tax on the agricultural income are necessary.
"
4188,"Income tax from non-agricultural sector also has been systematically collected.
"
4189,"Base of income tax has eroded because of weak tax administration and many concessions allowed thereto.
"
4190,"After a thorough review of present tax structure, institution of low rates of income taxes with minimum of tax concessions in lieu of high rates will probably help reduce tax evasion and tax leakages too.
"
4191,"Revenue collected from urban land holdings and housing properties is also limited.
"
4192,"The main reasons for this are the concessions granted to the industries and hotels, the higher rates of such concessions, inability to update the assessment of land holding and housing properties and lack of strict follow up to collect such taxes after identification of evaders of such taxes.
"
4193,"The base of indirect taxes like excise imposed on domestic production and sales tax is also narrow.
"
4194,"Main sources of indirect tax revenue has been alcohol and cigarettes.
"
4195,"Elasticity of tax revenue to national income is very low at present.
"
4196,"Due to this reason, the increase in national income has not adequately been reflected in the generation of revenue.
"
4197,"To enhance the elasticity of tax revenue, measures to replace -existing taxes rates based on quantity by advaloren taxes, wherever possible, can contribute to the increase in resource mobilisation.
"
4198,"It is high time now to take steps to assess contributions to the revenue from these industries also, based on revision of tax facilities these industries are enjoying in accordance with the policy of industrial promotion. Additionally new sources of revenue should be identified.
"
4199,"Sales taxes can be levied on the services offered by corporations like telephone, telecommunication, electricity, drinking water.
"
4200,"It is necessary to determine appropriate rates of duty for the services charging low rates at present after the reassessment of such duties.
"
4201,"Revamping of tax administration has been the priority issue for the .effective collection of revenue.
"
4202,"Institutional and professional development of revenue administration should immediately be taken up.
"
4203,"Only by doing so, system of revenue collection can be made effective and leakages, checked.
"
4204,"There are still additional measures to be adopted to tap the net profit of the government owned-corporations and thereby, enhance their contribution level to government revenue.
"
4205,"Despite steps undertaken to run these public corporations professionally and efficiently, it is now time that concrete measures be introduced to enhance their level of efficiency. It has become difficult to finance for additional development outlays as government failed to realise adequate returns from investment need in different sectors.
"
4206,"The revenue collected from different services like irrigation, mini- hydel plants, transportation, drinking water projects, sewage, higher education, hospitals is not even enough to meet the cost of repair and maintenance, let alone the recovery of such investment.
"
4207,"To continue further investment in the development of such sectors demand changes in this situation. For this, fixation of appropriate duties and their effective collection must be insured.
"
4208,"In addition to above measures to achieve higher level mobilisation of resources, measures also must be taken to restrain the growth of regular expenditure.
"
4209,"Specific control should be exercised on the recruitment of extra personnel in the government offices than these are absolutely necessary.
"
4210,"Measures also should be adopted to close down or integrate unnecessary offices after the detailed study of work volume of each of these.
"
4211,"Subsidy policies should also be reviewed and the budget releived of the pressure emerging from the increasing subsidies provided in the distribution of foodgrains and chemical fertilizers.
"
4212,"In case the measures cited above for the mobilisation of resources and control of regular expenditure are not taken up in time, a great difficulty in the adequately mobilisation of internal resources would render the meeting of the targeted amount of outlay for the government sector extremely difficult.
"
4213,"No specific imp rovement in the utilization of foreign aid seemed to have been brought about in the Sixth Plan period. Only 39 percent of total available foreign aid was utilized in that period.
"
4214,"As of July 15,1985, balance of unutilized foreign aid including grants and loans amount to Rs 19.72 billion.
"
4215,"Though a sharp increase in the foreign aid is unlikely due to the unfavourable international aid climate, it is expected that foreign aid to the tune of Rs 23.15 billion will be available for the Seventh Plan period. This is at the rate of Rs 4.63 billion annually at constant price of 1984/85.
"
4216,"Thus it is estimated that the total foreign aid of Rs 4.87 billion together with the amount as of July 15,1985 and those to be available in the plan period will represent the total fund that should be utilized in the Seventh Plan.
"
4217,"Thus, our problem lies not in the exploration of further aid but in failure to effectively use foreign aid already available.
"
4218,"If the past experience of the Sixth Plan is any guide to future, it is doubtful wheter or not even 40 percent of available foreign aid could be spent.
"
4219,"The requirements of foreign aid utilization in the Seventh Plan, however, is based on the estimate that 50. I percent of foreign aid or Rs 20.48 billion would be utilised.
"
4220,"Unless there is a substantial improvement in our absorptive capacity, it will be very difficult to utilize foreign aid.
"
4221,"As such concrete steps should be taken towards the solution of present obstacles (like delay in the approval of tender, weaknesses in administrative management and coordination, and impractical financial rules and regulations etc.) to enhance the absorptive capacity.
"
4222,"In order to enhance the foreign aid utilization and to boost up production without loss of time, a substantive portion of foreign aid that will be available in the Seventh Plan should be channeIlised towards activities directly contributing to the increase in production.
"
4223,"This approach will greatly aid in the speedy utilization of foreign aid and in attaining the objective of increasing production and of meeting the minimum 8 basic needs of people.
"
4224,"Appropriation and Allocation of Development Expenditure As a great stride is unlikely in overcoming the scarcity of internal resources and in boosting the absorptive capacity, size of development expenditure for the Seventh Plan period cannot be increased immensely; Therefore, development expenditure has been limited to Rs 29 billion.
"
4225,"At constant prices, development expenditure had shrunk to Rs 5.50 billion in the fourth and fifth year of the Sixth Plan.
"
4226,"In context of total expenditure of Rs 25.33 billion during the Sixth Plan, the proposed development outlay of Rs 29 billion is bigger by only 14 percent at the constant price of 1984/85.
"
4227,"Development expenditure is estimated to increase by 1 .8 percent annually during the plan .period.
"
4228,"According to the estimates, development expenditure has increased by 8 percent in the Sixth Plan period at constant price of 1984/85.
"
4229,"As the size of development expenditure cannot be increased beyond Rs 29 billion, the following investment policies should be adopted while allocating of development expenditure in the Seventh Plan.
"
4230,"1. To allocate resources to priority projects under construction for their early completion.
"
4231,"2. To chalk, out non-priority projects from the plan itself after reassessment of the projects programmes under implementation.
"
4232,"3. To take up new projects to the extent the surplus resources permit after allocating resources for the completion of projects under implementation. 4. While taking up new projects, to give first priority to projects and programmes that are helpful for the fuller utilisation of infrastructures already created with minimum of investment, thereby contributing to the increase in production and to place second priority to projects and programmes that will enhance production and help meet minimum basic needs as envisaged in the plan.
"
4233,"Adequate statistics and materials have not been available to formulate five years programme in accordance with above policies.
"
4234,"Decision has yet to be taken on what projects and programmes under implementation should be continued in the plan and what projects and programmes are to be chalked out or amended following closely to the plan objectives.
"
4235,"Similarly, detailed study and cost benefit analysis have not been done to identify the economic justification- of proposed projects and to identify whether these could fulfil the plan objectives or not. In this context, it is not sought to incorporate a detailed list of all projects and programmes.
"
4236,"As such, efforts have been made to provide guidelines on the priority allocation to public sector investment programmes of different sectors according to the objectives of the Seventh Plan.
"
4237,"At the time of formulation of annual development plan and budget preparation, practice of incorporating projects and programmes in the annual plan only after their detailed analysis will be pursued.
"
4238,"In allocation of resources for public sector in the Seventh Plan, policy of allocating more resources to priority sectors will be adopted.
"
4239,"Accordingly priority will be assigned to and more resources allocated for the development of agriculture, irrigation and forest sectors.
"
4240,"Second priority has been assigned to the development of industries and power for which 26 percent of total development outlay has been earmarked. Emphasis has been laid on the development especially of cottage and small scale industries in the context of the industrial development.
"
4241,"In power, emphasis has been laid on the completion of Marshyangdi hydro-electricity project, and on the extension of the transmission lines.
"
4242,"For the social service and miscellaneous sectors 25.7 percent of the development outlay has been earmarked.
"
4243,"In the social service sector, priority has been assigned to primary education, adult education, vocational and technical education, drinking water and basic health services.
"
4244,"Emphasis has been placed on the qualitative rather than quantity on services in the development of education and health services.
"
4245,"For the development of transport and communication, 17.7 percent of development outlay has been earmarked.
"
4246,"In transportation, emphasis is placed on the completion of remaining part of western sector of East-West highway and on the construction of projects like suspension bridges to facilitate services of transportation. Of the development outlay of Rs 29 billion, amounts have been set aside to provide refinance of Rs 500 million for 19ricultural Development Bank and Rs 250 million for Nepal Industrial Development Corporation to assist private farmers and entrepreneurs for agricultural and industrial development, and of Rs 250 million to Commercial Banks for the development of cottage and small scale industries.
"
4247,"Construction Materials like cement, iron steel goods, bricks and development materials like pipes, petroleum products, coke & coal and chemical fertilizers play an important role in the development & construction projects.
"
4248,"As such, an attempt has been made to estimate quantity, cost of construction & development materials and study supply provisions of these materials while formulating periodic plan.
"
4249,"The Sixth Plan had emphasized the promotion of the domestic production of such construction and development materials, economising the use of imported materials and the research in the use of local materials in the Hill areas. There has been some achievements towards the promotion of domestic production of construction materials.
"
4250,"Hetauda Cement Factory has reached the phase of trial production and capacity expansion of Himal Cement Factory is underway.
"
4251,"If the production of iron rods has increased from industries of the Eastern and Central Development Regions, production of polythene pipes and corrugated sheets necessary for the construction of school and hospital buildings has commenced in the Sixth Plan Period.
"
4252,"However, the proposed Arc Furnace in Parwanipur and Fused Magnesium Phosphate (F.M.P.). Fertilized factory in Kharidhunga could not be materialized in the plan period.
"
4253,"Basic construction and development materials like cement, iron and steel goods, bricks, timber, polythene pipe, petroleum products, coke and coal, chemical fertilizers, paper, news print and explosives have been include& in projection of basic materials needed for the Seventh Plan.
"
4254,"At the conclusion of the Seventh Plan, 63.9 percent of cement, 16 percent of iron rods, almost 100 percent of bricks, timber, polythene pipes, paper are estimated to be supplied from internal production, but cent percent of petroleum products, chemical fertilizers, newsprints, coke& coal, have to be imported.
"
4255,"Objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan regarding supply of development & construction materials will be as follows:
"
4256,"2. Objective
"
4257,"(ii) 	To be less dependent on imported materials, continued efforts will be made to replace imports by domestic production by establishing industries that are feasible and that are based on local raw materials.
"
4258,"3. Polices (i) 	To emphasize the full capacity utilization of industries producing construction materials.
"
4259,"(ii) 	To adopt appropriate tax and import policies so as to encourage private sector in the import of construction materials, if in cases where there already is not an institutional unit specialising on the import of such materials.
"
4260,"(iii) 	To adopt appropriate policies to"" promote the' domestic production of 	construction materials.
"
4261,"(iv) 	To emphasize on research towards production and improvements in the quality and techniques of use of local materials so as to encourage maximum use of local materials like stones, slates, lime, timber in the hill and remote areas inaccessible by modern transport, and
"
4262,"(v) 	To emphasize on the up-date monitoring, by concerned institutions on balancing demand and supply situation of materials neces sary for the implementation of development and construction projects in each Development Region and on planning the supply, distribution and storage system of development and construction materials accordingly.
"
4263,"4. Demand and Supply Estimates of Materials
"
4264,"It is estimated that 2,507,200 M. tons of cement will be required for the construction works in the public and private sectors during the Seventh Plan.
"
4265,"Out of this 60 percent of 1,504,320 M. tons of cement is estimated for different development projects in the public sector and the rest for the private sector.
"
4266,"If the Chobhar and Hetauda Cement Factories in the Central Development Region manufacture according to their capacity 1,602,200 M. ton of cement (63.9 percent of total estimated demand) will be supplied from within the country.
"
4267,"Feasibility studies will be conducted for setting up of Cement Factories in other Development Regions also.
"
4268,"2. Iron and Steel Goods The estimated requirement of iron -and steel materials like iron rods, strip steel, plates, sheets, sectional steel is _estimated to be 410,178 M. tons in the Seventh Plan period.
"
4269,"Of the estimated requirement 267,769 M.ton (65 percent) is estimated to be consumed by public sector and the remaining 142,409 M. ton (35 percent) by the corporate and private sector.
"
4270,"At present, the total annual capacity of industries producing iron rods is 11,500 M. ton.
"
4271,"Requirement of timber is projected to be 625,638 cu. meter in the Seventh Plan. Out of this 125,128 cumetre of timber (20 percent) is estimated to be expended in public sector works and the remaining 500,510 cu. meter, (80 percent) for corporate and private sector works.
"
4272,"Supply of timber is being met from the fore sts within the country.
"
4273,"In addition to the demand for timber, demand for fuelwood is also increasing, as a result of which forest acreage is on the decline, affecting the supply of timber, Emphasis will be laid as such on the development of forests.
"
4274,"5. Polythene Pipes
"
4275,"As Seventh Plan has laid emphasis on expansion of drinking water facilities demand for polythene pipes is estimated to be around 8,300 M. tons.
"
4276,"Of these, 7,055 M. ton (85 percent) and the remaining 1,245 M. too are estimated to be expended in the public sector and private sector respec tively.
"
4277,"As production from industries in Balaju, Dharan and Kalaiya will meet above requirements it does not seem necessary to import polythene pipes.
"
4278,"6. Chemical Fertilizer
"
4279,"The total requirement of Chemical Fertilizers is estimated to be 426,500 M. tons of nutrients in the Seventh Plan.
"
4280,"Of the required nutrients, more than 95 percent will be needed for the private sector and the rest will be expended in the Government agricultural farms.
"
4281,"As all requirements of chemical fertilizers are met from imports, emphasis will be placed on application and promotion of .local organic fertilizers and studies will be conducted as to assess the feasibility of chemical fertilizer industry to gradually reduce the dependence on imports.
"
4282,"7. Mineral Oil Products
"
4283,"Under mineral oil products are included petroleum products like petroleum, high speed diesel, kerosene, furnace oil, aviation fuel, light diesel, light petroleum gas etc.
"
4284,"These petroleum products are necessary for different sectors from day to day transport services to construction works, agriculture, industries etc.
"
4285,"Though oil prospecting and exploration works are being conducted in the country, it will take several years before an oil prospect is identified, explored and drilled for oil production..
"
4286,"So the country has to depend on imports for all these petroleum products in the plan period.
"
4287,"In the Seventh Plan Period, a total of 826,013 M. tons of petroleum products is estimated to be required for public and private sectors as presented below.
"
4288,"8. Coke and ,Coal
"
4289,"Coke and Coal are beginning to replace the role of fuelwood in the domestic and industrial fuels.
"
4290,"Especially in the, border areas where fuelwood is beginning to be s carce coal has, been the alternative source of fuel.
"
4291,"With the establishme nt of new industries requirements of coal and coke has increased tremendously.
"
4292,"In the Seventh Plan period, 743,712 M. tons of coke and coal might be required.
"
4293,"As there are no good coal deposits in the country, all requirements of coke and coal except some lignite are met from imports.- With the increase in the price of oil, price of coke and coal has also increased.
"
4294,"Emphasis will be laid in the Seventh Plan on the institutional set up to regularise imports and supply of coal under long term contractual agreement,
"
4295,"9. Writing and Printing Paper
"
4296,"The maximum requirement of writing and printing paper in the Seventh Plan period is estimated at 75,768 M. tons.
"
4297,"Part of this requirement will be met from the production of Bhrikuti Paper Factory in Nawal Parasi.
"
4298,"Additionally the commissioning of Nepalgunj Paper Factory, will add to the domestic supply.
"
4299,"But to meet the total requirements of paper in the plan period the country will still have to depend mainly on import.
"
4300,"Of the quantities of writing and printing paper, it is estimated that 50 percent will be required for the public sector, and 50 percent for the private sector.
"
4301,"10. Newsprint
"
4302,"In the Plan period, it is estimated that maximum of 6,149 M. ton of newsprint will be required. Of this, 4,612 M. ton (75 percent) will be consumed in the public sector, and the rest 1,537 M. ton (25 percent), in the private sector.
"
4303,"11. Explosives
"
4304,"It is estimated that 7,755 M. ton of gelatin, 5,940,750 detonators, and 8,400,375 metres of fuse wire will be required in the Seventh Plan Period.
"
4305,"More than 97 percent of this requirement will be consumed by the construction works in the public sector and the rest by the private stone quarry workers.
"
4306,"As a separate Ministry of Supplies has been set up, projection and supply of development and construction materials except the explosives has been the explosives has been the responsibility of this Ministry.
"
4307,"Among the development and construction materials, supply and distribution of cement, iron and steel goods, writing and printing paper and newsprint are managed by the National Trading Ltd. and private traders; timber by the Timber Corporation of Nepal; Mineral oil products by Nepal Oil Corporation; and chemical fertilizers by the Agricultural
"
4308,"The liberal approach will be adopted to encourage private traders to import cement, iron and steel goods, coke and coal.
"
4309,"All requirements of Coke and Coal in the public sector will be met by institutional import arrangements under long term contractual agreements.
"
4310,"Chemical fertilizers and concerned institutional including National Trading Limited to import other materials.
"
4311,"6. Estimate of Expenditure for Construction Materials:
"
4312,"Different development and construction materials that will be needed (or the Seventh Plan are listed in the table below.
"
4313,"It is estimated that only for the petro leum products, the cost will be Rs 3 billion and Rs 700 million.
"
4314,"CHAPTER 6
"
4315,"PROVISION OF TECHNICAL MANPOWER
"
4316,"1. Background
"
4317,"As skilled and trained manpower is essential for effective implementation of periodic development plans of the country the provision manpower is utmost necessary.
"
4318,"But the revised supply situation is estimated to be 30,674 persons only, thereby being shortfall 8788 persons.
"
4319,"In view of the situation, efforts are top be made henceforth for the proper arrangement in providing more trainings and study opportunities in the country and aboard. The objectives and policies laid down in the Sixth Plan for the provision of technical manpower have been sret forth in the Seventh Plan also with an added impetus since those objectives and policies singled out in the Sixth Plan are also equally relevant, and significant today’s and have been hence, reinstated in the Seventh Plan.
"
4320,"In view of development objectives of the Seventh Plan, the objectives of manpower planning has been set as follows: a. To utilize the available technical manpower to the maximum
"
4321,"b. To maximize productivity and employment prospects of technical manpower.
"
4322,"c. To strike out a balance by removing disparities between demand and supply of manpower.
"
4323,"3. Policies
"
4324,"Following policies shall be adopted to meet those objectives:
"
4325,"a. To determine the number of students’ enrollment in technical institutes in accordance with the projected demanded projection for technical manpower,
"
4326,"b. To extend capacities of technical institutes and if found necessary, establish new additional institutes so to enhance quantitative as well as qualitative level,
"
4327,"c. To obtain more scholarships from abroad and send people for training and study abroad so as to increase supply of particular type of high level technicians.
"
4328,"d. To extensively conduct appropriate formal and informal training in the country to meet the shortage of medium and basic level manpower and to make necessary arrangement for the mobilization of basic level local skills by making them more efficient,
"
4329,"e. To help mobilization and utilization of technical manpower by means of modification in their career development, benefits, facilities, and recruitment procedures etc.
"
4330,"5. Classification and Level of Manpower
"
4331,"Technical personnels for the implementation of manpower development schemes for the Seventh Plan are divided into five sectors which are as follows: (1) Engineering (2) Health (3) Agriculture (4) Forestry & (5) Scientist and Technicians.
"
4332,"Those technical personnels- are divided into three levels (1) High Level (2) Medium Level and (3) Basic Level.
"
4333,"Out of these, Engineering sector is further classified into four sub-sectors namely Civil, Mechanical, Electrical and others; Health sector is reclassified into seven sub-sectors in the high level namely Doctor; Nurses, Radiography, Pharmacy, Ayurved etc, eight sub-sectors in the high level and sub-sector in the basic level.
"
4334,"Similarly the Agricultural Sectors has been broken into three sub-sectors namely Agricultural Sciences, Animal Sciences & other. General Forestry, Forest Research , Soil and Water Conservation, Wild life and others in High Level and Rangers.
"
4335,"But Scientists and Technicians are not further divided into any sub sector since that sector covers a lot of subjects.
"
4336,"6. Demand for manpower
"
4337,"Since more programs will be launched with more investments in the Seventh Plan that in the Sixth Plan, it is clear that the demand for manpower required for the public sector during the Seventh Plan period is made.
"
4338,"The present projection shows that the demand for the all level of technical manpower will increase remarkably as in the past.
"
4339,"The demand projection for Engineering sector manpower is shown in Table 1. In Health, 5588 persons are the total estimated stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85.
"
4340,"The total demand projection for the sector during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 3502 persons.
"
4341,"Out of this 1766 persons are the deficit during the Sixth plan period and 1754 persons are new additional requirements for the Seventh Plan.
"
4342,"Thus, the total estimated projections required by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 is projected to be 9108. The projection based on historical trends shows the remarkable increase at all level of technical manpow3er in this field.
"
4343,"During the Seventh Plan while demand for doctors is note worthy at the high level, demand for staff nurses, health assistant radiographers, pharmacists and lab technicians will be prominent at the medium level. So are the likely demand at the basic level manpower in almost all categories.
"
4344,"The demand projection for Health sector manpower is shown in Table No.
"
4345,"Deficit of forest manpower during the sixth plan period, were 204 persons at high and medium level, while there was surplus of 180 people at the basic level.
"
4346,"The total stock of the sixth plan along with the total demand projections of the Seventh Plan makes the total 3045 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90.
"
4347,"As in other sectors there will be remarkable increase of demand for manpower in this sector also General forestry at the high level and forest ranger at the medium level will be remarkable in this increase in demand.
"
4348,"The demand projection for forest sector manpower is shown in Table No.
"
4349,"4. In Scientists and Technical manpower, there will be a total stock of 2696 persons with a deficit of 174 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85. The total stocks deficit and additional demand for 1471 persons during the Seventh Plan period will end up with total required positions of 4371 by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90.
"
4350,"Demand for the basic level manpower will be more than the demand for manpower at other level.
"
4351,"The demand projection for Scientists and Technicians is shown in Table No. 5. As mentioned above, there will be a total stock of 30,647 technical persons in all of the five sectors by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85.
"
4352,"Among them, the highest stock is 15325 persons at basic level and after that 10023 and 5326 persons during the sixth Plan long with the additional demand for 12070 during the Seventh Plan total to the demand projected for 20858 persons during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4353,"Among the projected figure, the highest demand 9110 persons at the basic level, while the required medium and high level manpower are 7867 and 3881 respectively.
"
4354,"Similarly, the total estimate required positions by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 at the high, medium, and basic levels are 9207, 17890 and 24435 respectively making a total requirements of 51531.
"
4355,"The demand projection for total manpower is shown in Table No.
"
4356,"6. 7. Supply of Manpower
"
4357,"During the Seventh Plan period the supply from the internal production and that from the returnees from abroad after completing the study are estimated to be 4,265 persons and 536 persons respectively making a total supply of 4,801 by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90.
"
4358,"The supply projection of Engineering manpower is given in Table No.7.
"
4359,"The supply projection of Health manpower is given in Table No.8.
"
4360,"In Agriculture, the total stock of manpower by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 is estimated to be 7,351 persons. During the Seventh Plan period the number of outcome from the internal supply and returnees from abroad after completing the study is expected to be 3,458 persons and 550 persons respectively making a total supply of 4,008 persons.
"
4361,"Thus the total estimated agricultural manpower stock by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 is estimated to be 11,359 persons. According to the projection, Agricultural Science seems to be the highest in number among the total outcome of the country as well as among the returnees from abroad.
"
4362,"Similarly, supply of all the medium and basic level manpower are estimated to be met internally.
"
4363,"The supply projection of Agricultural manpower is given in Table Nos.9. In Forestry, the total manpower stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 are estimated to be 2,372 persons.
"
4364,"During the Seventh plan period the internal supply from the educational institutions in the country and the returnees after completing study from abroad are estimated to be 832 persons and 114 persons respectively making a total supply of 946 persons. Thus the total estimated stock by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90 is estimated to be 3,318 persons.
"
4365,"General forestry seems to be the only subject in high level that is produced from the only educational institution in the country.
"
4366,"The supply projection of Scientist and Technical manpower is shown in Table No.
"
4367,"As mentioned above, the total stock of technical manpower in all the five sectors by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 is estimated to be 30,674 persons.
"
4368,"During the Seventh Plan period the total internal supplies from the educational institutions and the returnees from abroad after completing their study is estimated to be 12,104 persons and 1,368 persons respectively making a total supply of 13,472 persons.
"
4369,"Among the internal supplies, while the highest number consist in the basic level having 5,732 persons, the supply in medium level is estimated to be 5,085 persons. But there will be internal supply of 1,287 persons only in the high level.
"
4370,"Similarly, the returnees from abroad after completing study will be only in the high level.
"
4371,"In this way, the total stock by the end of the fiscal year 1984/85 is estimated to be 30,674 persons and this figure along with the additional supply of 13.472 persons during the Seventh Plan makes the total estimated stock of 44,146 persons by the end of the fiscal year 1989/90.
"
4372,"The supply projection of total manpower is shown in Table No.
"
4373,"8. Demand and Supply Position
"
4374,"In this sector, shortages are expected in almost all the subjects and in all the three levels.
"
4375,"In the sixth plan period, while the prior estimation in this sector in high, middle and basic level was deficit of 485 persons, 280 persons, and 1,767 persons respectively making a total deficit of 2,827 persons, the revised estimate of shortage by the end of that period in that field are 340 persons, 883 persons and 1,604 persons respectively making a total deficit of 2,827 persons.
"
4376,"The demand and supply position of manpower in this sector is presented in Table No. 13.
"
4377,"In Health, the demand and supply during the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 3,520 persons and 2,450 persons respectively making a deficit of 1,070 persons.
"
4378,"During the sixth plan, there was an estimation of 71 and 442 persons as deficit in high and basic level respectively but with a surplus of 1,380 persons in the medium level making the total surplus of 867 persons thereby.
"
4379,"The main reason behind the estimation of the shortage of 538 persons in middle level during the Seventh Plan in spite of estimated surplus of 1380 persons during the sixth plan is due to the increase in demand in middle level in the sixth plan with a sufficient supply thereby making a shortfall of 585 persons during that period and non-supply of manpower in the Seventh Plan also in accordance with the need.
"
4380,"The demand and supply position of Health manpower is presented in Table No.
"
4381,"In Forest manpower, while a big shortage was expected in high and basic level but with a huge surplus in the medium level by the end of the sixth plan, the actual revised estimate has been some few shortage in high and medium level but with some more surplus in the basic level because of large supply in that level than needed, by end of the fiscal year 1984/85.
"
4382,"As a result there shall be no need of additional supply to be made in the basic level during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4383,"While supply in the high level is expected to be the same as is demanded there will be surplus, in the medium level because of excess supply during the Seventh Plan.
"
4384,"The demand and supply position of  manpower is presented in Table No.
"
4385,"In Scientist and Technical manpower, there will be total supply of 1,267 persons out of 1,645 persons demanded making a total deficit of 378 persons.
"
4386,"The demand and supply position of Scientist and Technical manpower is presented in Table No.
"
4387,"Thus, the total demand and supply of all types of technical manpower mentioned for the Seventh Plan period is estimated to be 20,858 persons and 13,472 persons respectively thereby making a total deficit of 7,386 persons.
"
4388,"Among them, there will be shortage in all levels of all sectors except in the medium and the basic level of forest sector where there will be few surplus.
"
4389,"The demand and supply position of total manpower presented in Table No.
"
4390,"9. Supply Arrangements to meet the Deficit
"
4391,"While there will be a nominal surplus in the medium and basic level manpower under Forest sector there will be shortages in all levels of all other sectors and since it is very difficult at present to meet those deficits to the full extent because of the limited means and resources available in the country more arrangements will be made to obtain more foreign scholarships for the study and training.
"
4392,"In this connection, the high level experts required under foreign aided projects will be met by means of supply through the concerned government and International organizations.
"
4393,"Besides, more efforts will be made in obtaining more scholarships in the effected areas and send people abroad to meet the deficit.
"
4394,"Necessary arrangements, will also be made in making more efforts for the development, reforms facilities, appointment systems etc. for technical personnels engaged in technical profession in different Institutes of Tribhuvan University.
"
4395,"In spite of these best efforts it is expected to take more than four years to produce high level technicians like engineers and health specialists, and three to four years to produce like agricultural specialists. Hence arrangements in hiring foreign technical experts will be made available to meet the immediate requirements.
"
4396,"There will be huge shortage of middle level manpower in Engineering. Health and Agricultural sectors and to remove such shortage efforts will be made for the development of capacities of different technical institutes in a better way so as to meet the deficit manpower quantitatively as well as qualitatively during the Seventh Plan period.
"
4397,"While arrangements will be made in providing better trainings to the local skills available in the villages and thereby mobilizing them; arrangements will also be made to provide useful short-term trainings to local people and ex-military man as and when necessary through Government project related office for the additional supply of manpower in the basic level.
"
4398,"These arrangements will make a great contrib ution in meeting the deficit of basic level manpower and hence to developmental works.
"
4399,"It is clearly understandable that the exercise regarding manpower planning should be made in a managed and scientific way so as to delete the imbalances and problems that occurred between demand and supply.
"
4400,"Similarly at present, exercises are being done only for the manpower that are needed for the development projects to be operated by the government and no exercises are being done in the private sector.
"
4401,"Since private sector also plays a vital role in the economic development of the country the manpower exercise in that sector also is quite necessary.
"
4402,"During the Seventh Plan period, more efforts will be made in making managed & scientific performance in collecting data and information and analytical works regarding formulation of manpower development planning in the government as well as private sector and attention will also be given to make manpower planning more reliable and practicable.
"
4403,"NATIONAL LEVEL POLICIES FOR THE SEVENTH PLAN
"
4404,"CHAPTER 7 POPULATION AND EMPLOYMENT POLICY
"
4405,"1. Population Position
"
4406,"a) Population Growth:
"
4407,"Though population census were undertaken every 10 years since 1911 a census based on international standards was completed only in 1952/55.
"
4408,"Thus between 1952/55 and 1981, the national population increased by 6,649,361.
"
4409,"The rate of population growth from 1952/55 to 1981 is shown in Table 7.01.
"
4410,"The census of 1981 exhibits population growth in an indirect way.
"
4411,"During this period population growth is 30 percent as compared to that of 1971 and the annual growth rate is 2.66 percent.
"
4412,"It is assumed here that this growth rate will remain valid for the period 1981-84.
"
4413,"At this growth rate the population of  will reach 30.00 million within the next 23 years.
"
4414,"b) Number of Families:
"
4415,"The population of 15,022,839, according the census of 1981 has been grouped into 2,585,154 families.
"
4416,"Thus one family consists of 5.80 members in the average.
"
4417,"Population distribution according to the development and geographical regions is given in Table 7.02 and Table 7.03 respectively.
"
4418,"c) Birth and Fertility Rate:
"
4419,"The main reason for the fast growth of population in the recent years is that the birth rate is still remaining high whereas the death rate has declined.
"
4420,"Various studies have indicated that the crude (approximate) birth rate has remained at 41.57 per thousand.
"
4421,"Likewise the fertility rate of woman according to census 1981 is 6.3.
"
4422,"The fertility rate in the age bracket of 25-29 is high.
"
4423,"That between 20-24 years is still higher.
"
4424,"The fertility rate of the women in the rural areas is higher than that of the urban areas.
"
4425,"d) Death Rate:
"
4426,"Though during the last few years this rate has dropped remarkably.
"
4427,"The fast growth of population has a direct bearing on the drop of death rate.
"
4428,"In 1980 the crude (approximate) death rate was recorded at 19 per thousand.
"
4429,"Now this rate is 16.57 per thousand.
"
4430,"e) Age Composition: In the census 1981 population belonging to the age group 0-14 years was 41.40 percent, 15-59 years 52.90 percent and above 60 years 5.70 percent.
"
4431,"On the one hand, the burden of bringing up of 41.40 percent of the population falls on the population in age group 15-59 years while on the other, because of the higher proportion of population in the age group 0-14 years high fertility population will increase in the future.
"
4432,"Table 7.04 presents this picture clearly.
"
4433,"f) 	Regional Distribution of Population
"
4434,"The population census 1981 shows that 1,302,896 persons live in the Himali Region, 7,163,115 in the Hilly Region and 6,556,828 in the Terai Region, In other words 8.70 percent of the total population live in the Himali Region, 47.70 percent in the Hilly Region and 43.60 per cent in the Terai Region.
"
4435,"Between 1971 and 1981 there has been a change (in percent) in the distribution of population. The annual growth rate at 1.50 percent in the Himali Region and of 1.60 percent in the Hilly Region; and with 4.20 percent growth rate in the Terai Region population has grown excessively there.
"
4436,"The population density of the country was 79 persons per sq. km in 1971 which increased to 102 persons per sq. km in 1981.
"
4437,"In 1981 population density in Himali Region is 25. 10 persons per sq. km in Hilly Region 116. 80 persons per sq. km and 192 persons per sq. km. in the Terai Region.
"
4438,"g) Rehabilitation:
"
4439,"Distribution, composition and growth of population has a direct bearing on migration.
"
4440,"If the process of migration from the Hilly Region to Terai Region and from rural area to urban areas has speeded up, bigger migration has been taking place.
"
4441,"According to 1981 census, 929,585 persons migrated between 1971-1981 on the basis of geographical regions, Table 7.06 shows the migration taking from Himali Region and Hilly Region to Terai Region.
"
4442,"On analyzing the statistics of migration based on census 1981, 14,784,246 persons, or 98 .41 per cent of the total population of 15,022,839, have been found to have been born in  while 234,039 persons, or 1. 66 per cent in foreign land and 4,554 or 0.03 percent has no known birth places.
"
4443,"Adequate employment opportunities have to be created by developing modern facilities and amenities in the Terai Region for the increasing population there.
"
4444,"There is also necessity of launching various programmes for creating employment opportunities in the Himali and Hilly regions and for discouraging migration from these areas.
"
4445,"Similarly, there is a necessity 19 Frame regulations for citizenship and employment in keeping with the inflow for rehabilitation.
"
4446,"Population Projection♣ Since people are the resource for development and at the same time receiver of development fruits, projection of population is highly desirable to judge the impact of its growth in national development activities.
"
4447,"In order to bring down the annual growth rate of population to 1.2 percent and the total fertility rate per female, to 2.5 in accordance with the long term population strategy, it has been necessary to bring down the growth rate of population to 1.99 and total fertility rate per female to 4 during the Seventh Plan.
"
4448,"As such, two types of Population Projection have been made for the Seventh Plan.
"
4449,"Whereas the first projection is based on the target of reducing the annual population growth rate to 1.99 and the total fertility rate to 4 percent, the second projection is based on the above tendency of the expected annual population growth rate of 2.61 and the total fertility rate of 5.8 during the plan period.
"
4450,"The annual population estimate during the Seventh Plan period on the basis of the first and the second projection are presented in Table 7.07 (a) add 7.07(b). ♣
"
4451,"The economic and the physical targets of the Seventh Plan, has been made on the basis of 2.66 annual population growth rate.
"
4452,"Age wise Classification of Projected Population.
"
4453,"The age wise classification of the estimated population presents a special picture. In order to analyze population from the economic point of view, the classification of population has been made in three age groups ie. 0-4, 15-59 and 60 and above. The age group population, according to the above population projection No.1 and 2 are given in Table No.
"
4454,"Effect of Population Growth on Various Sectors
"
4455,"Increase in population tends to have adverse effect on various development sectors.
"
4456,"Achievements in the field of economic development, on per capita basis appear to be extremely low.
"
4457,"On the one hand, average agriculture production could not increase as expected in spite of the various measures for increasing per capita food grain production to meet the needs of the growing population, on the other hand extension of cultivable land is limited because of the mountainous native of the country.
"
4458,"Adverse environmental situation has been created in the Hilly Region and Terai Region by extensive felling of trees for housing, extension of cultivable land and for other uses.
"
4459,"The qualitative and quantitative development of education has been hampered because of the increasing number of students, caused mainly by the growth in population.
"
4460,"In spite of various measures taken in the field of health services to upgrade the general health standard of the people, no significant improvement has been recorded in the health indicators namely the morbidity, mortality and the average expectancy of life.
"
4461,"3. Population Policy in the Seventh Plan
"
4462,"It is universally known that the ever-increasing population pressure cannot be solved by short term and one-sided programmes.
"
4463,"Therefore, long-term objective and multi-faceted national population policy was adopted in the mid-term of the Sixth Plan keeping in view the growing population.
"
4464,"A fifteen-year population target covering a period between 1985-2000 was fixed according to which annual population growth rate is to be reduced to 1.20 percent and fertility rate per woman to 2.5.
"
4465,"a. Employment Promotion: Manpower is one of the major resources of the country.
"
4466,"Population of is increasing at the annual rate of 2.66 percent.
"
4467,"It is natural that economically active population also grows along with the overall population growth.
"
4468,"Increase of unemployed and semi-employed population adversely affects the economic activities of the country.
"
4469,"Various measures were launched in increasing employment opportunities in the previous plans.
"
4470,"If agricultural tools were made available so were the irrigation facilities extended in order to increase the employment opportunities for the small farmers.
"
4471,"Employment opportunities were made available to the unemployed and semi-employed rural population by launching rehabilitation programmes.
"
4472,"Creation of employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sectors such as industry, construction activities and services, were attempted in order to divert the additional burden on agriculture by the added labor force.
"
4473,"In spite of all these efforts, the problem of unemployment and semi-employment has not been much affected.
"
4474,"Between 1971 and 1981 economically active population has increased 2.00 million and at the rate of 200,000 per annum.
"
4475,"Because employment opportunities did not increase adequately in the non-agriculture sectors, the increasing economically active population had to depend upon agriculture for employment. The problem of semi-employed is very critical and at the same time educated unemployed is also increasing.
"
4476,"If the need is there for the utilization of unemployed and semi-unemployed labour force as a resource for development, so also is the need to create production employment opportunities in order to raise the standard of living of the people.
"
4477,"b. Shape of Labour Force: Though the international convention is to take the population over 15 year as the labour force, in  a big segment of the population of age-group 10-14 years, is also included in the economically active labour.
"
4478,"Table 7.09 presents the shape and participation rates on the basis of census of 1971 and 1981.
"
4479,"The 7.10 presents the projected statistics of the expected chanes in the labour force during the Seventh Plan. The total population of  is estimated to be 16,625,439 in 1985 and 18,913,718 in 1990.
"
4480,"During the Seventh Plan period the total population is expected to increase by 2.888 million.
"
4481,"Accordingly, population of 10 years and above is expected to increase by 1.585 million.
"
4482,"On the basis of the expected increase in the participation of the population age group of 10 years and above, the economically active population will be 7.814 million in 1990 the number of economically active population will increase by 1.041 million, and hence, it is necessary to create employment opportunities for this additional increment in the labour market.
"
4483,"91.30 percent of the economically active population according to 1981 census is engaged in agriculture.
"
4484,"Without changes in the vocational (professional) make-up of the labor force, people depend more on agriculture for employment.
"
4485,"Only 3.30 percent of the economically active population is engaged on industry, and 3.80 percent on service industry.
"
4486,"Howevery, the services sector is growing at a relatively fast rate.
"
4487,"In the Sixth Plan, target for employment opportunities was set at creating 1,772,829 man years in government, panchayat and private sectors.
"
4488,"Of this 1094,826 man years of employment were to be created in government sector, 414,062 man years in agriculture and forest sector, 60131 man years in industry and electricity, 372,130 man years in transport and communication and 248,503 man years in social services.
"
4489,"It is not possible to assess in full to what extent the Sixth Plan target was fulfilled.
"
4490,"Employment opportunities could be created because the government and private sectors investment lagged behind the planned targets. Lack of improvements in agriculture and industry did not bring about any change worth mentioning in the semi-employment opportunities for the maximum utilization of population remains a Herculean task.

"
4493,"WATER RESOURCE AND FUEL POLICY
"
4494,"Water resource in  is an inexhaustible resource whose harnessing will strengthen the economy of the country.
"
4495,"In fact, the prospects for a bright future of  largely depends upon the development of water resources.
"
4496,"Harnessing this resource will support the all-round development efforts of the country as especially in the fields of electricity, general irrigation drinking water, fishery, tourism industry, transport based on electricity, export development capability, and so on.
"
4497,"Greater efforts are still required for realising the multi-purpose uses and development of water resource for long term economic development.
"
4498,"a. Electricity
"
4499,"i) Generation of power: The achievement gained in the field of power development is very negligible. Various studies conducted so far reveal that generation of 25,000 Megawatt is economically and technically feasible even though the potential exploitable estimate is 83,000 Megawatt.
"
4500,"As of the end of the Sixth Plan the total installed capacity of power generation in the country is only 129.60 Megawatt, which is 0.16 per cent of the total potential power and 0.52 per cent of the commercially exploitable power capacity.
"
4501,"At the end of the Sixth Plan per capita power consumption in  is estimated to be 22 units whereas in the neighbouring least developing countries, it is significantly greater.
"
4502,"Inadequate studies and shortage of financial, technical and managerial inputs have been responsible for this state of affairs so far. From table 8.01 it is also clear that expected success has not attained in the past.
"
4503,"This situation can be attributed to the imbalanced development of power generation transmission and distribution.
"
4504,"Table 8.03 presents the picture of power generation, its import and export and consumption in  for the last few years.
"
4505,"The current consumption rate does not appear to be very favourable either. At times of shortage of power generation capacity regular supply of power grew at 12 per cent per annum.
"
4506,"In the Sixth Plan it was estimated to grow at 16 per cent.
"
4507,"The actual growth rate of power consumption in the past few years is presented in the Table 8.04.
"
4508,"Inability to utilise the installed capacity of power generation and dropping of annual consumption rate have become a subject of grave concern, This calls for improvement of transmission and distribution capacity in proportion with the power generation capacity and for tariff charges in line with t e capacity of the people and consumer to pay.
"
4509,"The experience of the past has proved this venture to be costly because of inadequate studies, use of costly equipment and commodities, high transportation cost, shortage of technical manpower and contractors.
"
4510,"The achievements of the Sixth Plan are presented in Table 8.06.
"
4511,"This is only 13.03 percent of the total irrigable land.
"
4512,"This sort of low irrigation facilities after 6 periodic plans can not be considered encouraging.
"
4513,"Moreover out of this total, only 42.00 per cent or 5.47 per cent of the total irrigable land will receive irrigation facility effectively.
"
4514,"Feasible surface, lift and pond irrigation projects have to be implemented for making the hilly region self-reliant.
"
4515,"c. 	Surface and underground water development projects must be implemented on a priority basis to utilise the water resources of the country.
"
4516,"But the progress so far has not been satisfactory.
"
4517,"Sikta, Babai and Bagmati projects are the examples of slow implementation.
"
4518,"The call of the day is to utilise the indigenous economic resources in harnessing the water resources by depending less on external resources.
"
4519,"If benefits derived from irrigation projects ca be permanently maintained, their utility value will increase and thus, enhance the agricultural production of the country.
"
4520,"Because of the different constraints, irrigation projects of the previous plans could not be properly maintained.
"
4521,"Therefore, in the Seventh Plan, special attention will be given to supervision and maintenance of the completed irrigation projects in order to make available properly managed and reliable supply of irrigation water to the farmer without adversely affecting the agriculture programmes of the Seventh Plan.
"
4522,"Necessary steps will also be taken to encourage participation of the farmers in such projects.
"
4523,"e. 	Since irrigation water, supplied to the farmers, will increase their agricultural production, proper maintenance of projects constructed at a big investment can possibly be carried out only if the farmer pays irrigation water tax.
"
4524,"Such taxes will help service the foreign loans and, at the same time, any surplus can be invested in the new projects.
"
4525,"g. 	Land erosion has posed itself as a national problem. Timely control of floods and prevention of erosions is extremely essential and these activities have to be carried within the limited economic and technical capability of the country and with the participation of the people.
"
4526,"4. Alternate Fuel Development a. At present per capita fuel consumption is 224 kg. 94 percent, of which is met by traditional fuel and 6 percent by commercial fuel.
"
4527,"Fuel supply is met mostly by timber, firewood and imported petroleum products. Unceasing deforestation and ever-increasing prices of commodities not only put a brake to the development works but also adversely affect the balance of payments.
"
4528,"Fuel problem is magnifying itself and is having an adverse effect on the ecology itself.
"
4529,"In the immediate future, programmes for the development of alternate sources of fuels, and for protection and preservation of forest have become a necessity.
"
4530,"The contribution of RECAST in the development and distribution of improved Chulo is worth mentioning. Agricultural Development Bank made agricultural credit on concessional interest under Asian Development Bank credit assistance, to the farmers, for installation of improved Chulo and bio-gas plants. 1620 family and community bio-gas plants were installed under the Small Farmers Development Project through the UNICEF assistance. With the installation of 250 multipurpose water-mills and crossflow turbines, support for agro-processing by increased power as compared to traditional -water-mill was supplied.
"
4531,"Though industries belonging to the private sector such As Balaju Yantrashala (Pvt.)
"
4532,"Ltd. established water heaters and solar driers but increased initial cost and lack of publicity limited their use.
"
4533,"Similarly surveys were conducted in Mustang, Manang, Lamjung and Syangja on air-power development but no implementation has taken place.
"
4534,"If the government can assist the private sector organistions specifically involved in the research, development and uses of bio-gas plant, gober gas plant, improved chulo, improved water-mill, solar energy and air power economically and technically, use of those equipments and methods will increase with less pressures on the traditional source of fuel.
"
4535,"Programmes launched by the private sector have not been very effective, but even then, these have their own importance.
"
4536,"Special efforts are, therefore, required for development of alternate fuels in the Seventh Plan.
"
4537,"1. The main objective will be to execute projects for multipurpose use of the inexhaustible water resources for activities like electricity, irrigation, drinking water, flood control, etc.
"
4538,"2. The secondary objective will be to replace the traditional consumption of fuels by making use of possible sources of alternate fuels. Policy
"
4539,"The following policy will be adopted in fulfilling the above objectives:
"
4540,"15. Constant effort will be made to seek mutual assistance among the countries of the region for expediting the execution of relatively big multi-purpose projects like Karnali (Chisapani).
"
4541,"16. Power and irrigation water charges will be made more scientific and will be made available at concessional rates to the productive users.
"
4542,"Working Policy
"
4543,"Since a few decades there has been a big change in the ecology of the country.
"
4544,"High population growth rate, dependence of over 90 % of population on agriculture, non-availability of other employment opportunities, and fast and unbalanced execution of development and construction activities are the main causes for this destructive change.
"
4545,"In the absence of employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sectors and in view of the increasing demand for foodgrains for population likely to double within the next 26 years, extension of land for agricult ure cultivation is very likely to increase substantially without any attention to the productivity of land, cultivation of the marginal lands, excessive felling of trees, excessive use of forest products and over-grazing, there can be considered the agrarian characteristics of the country.
"
4546,"Excessive deforestation in the mountain is increasing the loss of life and property by floods and landslides.
"
4547,"Fertile soil is being washed out by small and big rivers.
"
4548,"Production is dropping inspite of greater efforts of the farmers.
"
4549,"It is estimated that every year a layer of 1.70 mm. of fertile soil is washed away. 13 per cent of Chure and mid -hilly range is suffering from landslides.
"
4550,"Denudation, floods and landslides have been on the increase since a few years and desertification process in the mountain area is gaining speed.
"
4551,"Desertification of about 10,000 hectares in Dolpa and Mustang districts has started and is spreading in other areas as indicated by deteriorating of ecology.
"
4552,"It has been estimated that 47 %of the denudation and landslide are of natural causes whereas the rest is man-made.
"
4553,"People from the hills are migrating to terai because of denudation, floods, and landslides there and forest in the terai area has been depleted very fast since the last two decades.
"
4554,"Out of the total land area of 147,181sq.kilometre of the country, 18% is agricultural land and only 37.60% in forest land.
"
4555,"The pressure is clearly increasing on the forest because 81%of the fuel required by the people is met by the firewood.
"
4556,"This will continue for sometime till altern2.te fuels are developed, the ecologists estimate that 43 %of the total land should always be covered by forest. 94% of the population still depends on agriculture. In meeting the daily necessities of man and animals 50.00 million tons of green grasses required.
"
4557,"If the present rate of consumption of forest products and productivity is allowed to continue, forests in Terai and interior Terai will be exhausted in the next 20 years and in the hilly region in the next 10 years. protection and development has become a. big challenge.
"
4558,"Irrigation facilities, electrification, roads construction and industrialisation are essential for economic and social development of the country but these activities are increasing the pressure, directly or indirectly, to the national resource base and air, water and sound pollution is continuously increasing.
"
4559,"Though use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides for increasing foodgrain production is a must but their unscientific application not only adversely affects the agriculture productivity but also endangers the ecological balance.
"
4560,"Old and condemned vehicles have increased air pollution in the urban areas. Strong indication are being visible now that the ecology of the  is greatly affected by industrialisation process.
"
4561,"Physicians are of the opinion that use of firewood without improved chulo produce smoke which not only pollute air but also make women of the rural areas more vulnerable for attack by various diseases.
"
4562,"Drinking water is being supplied to urban areas but people in the hilly region have to walk several miles for a pitcher of water because of depletion of forest there.
"
4563,"Physicians opine that water pollution is the cause of about 50%of the prevalent diseases. has not experienced sound pollution as yet.
"
4564,"Vehicles blowing horns unnecessarily and the evil practice of using pressure horns by buses and truck on top of natural horns is increasing.
"
4565,"Without adequately providing drinking water, drainage and sewerage and electrical supply, uncontrolled and ill-managed urbanization has increased a lot of dirt which have polluted water, air and sound and so variety of diseases is increasing.
"
4566,"Development projects carried out without proper studies have affected the ecology of the place adversely.
"
4567,"Hilly roads and highways which 'are constructed without proper studies are increasing the ecological problems.
"
4568,"If there is a need of natural resources for the execution of various development projects for the economic and social well-being of the people, preservation of natural resources and ecology is equally essential to give them comforts of life, nutrient food, pure air and water.
"
4569,"Scientific land users equally important because ecology and land ale well interdependent.
"
4570,"2. Land-use
"
4571,"Various studies have produced important statistics about the land use.
"
4572,"It has been possible to determine the statistics of the area of cultivable and of the country at random.
"
4573,"Demarcation of plots in many districts have been completed. According to Land Resources Mapping Project (LR.M.P. )report, statistics of land in 59 districts is in the final form.
"
4574,"The area of the cultivable land of the remaining 16 districts can be estimated from the statistics available so far though estimation of production on the basis of estimated cultivable land area is not really desirable. Foxing the cultivable land area based on the increase of land revealed from the annual crops is advisable.
"
4575,"On this basis, the cultivable land area of the country is 2,653,300 hectares.
"
4576,"According to the National Agriculture Census of 1981 (sample survey) the land used by farmers totals 2,463,700 hectares.
"
4577,"Though these two figures differ the cultivable land area of 2,653,300 hectares is computed by identifying the summer crop area and winter crop area and hence this figure has been recognised as the valid one for the purpose203'of the Seventh Plan.
"
4578,"This statistics differs from the one which was estimated for the Sixth Plan.
"
4579,"The total area of the country is 14,718,100 hectares (147,181 sq. kilometer) of which agriculture covers 2,653,300 hectares (18 percent) and forest 5,533,490 hectares (37.60percent). Land composition of the total land area of the country on the basis of different types of land-use is shown in the Table 9.01.

"
4582,"EXPORT POLICY
"
4583,"1. Introduction
"
4584,"The population growth is increasing the demand for consumable goods and the in crease in capital investment for development is increasing the requirement of capital and construction goods. Unfavourable balance of payments have negative effects on the economy of the country and slower pace of industrialisation and weather-oriented agriculture production have caused dependence on imports.
"
4585,"Limited quantity of exportable goods, uncertainty, low level quality, lack of know-how on international marketing, land-lockedness and non-competitive capability due to transport cost are the prominent factors affecting 's export.
"
4586,"On top of these, inspite of the steps taken for developing the competitiveness of the exportable goods, there are grievances of the exporters' inability to receive the benefits in a simple and smooth manner due to complications in the administration of export encouragement schemes. The challenge now is to increase exports and earn and save foreign exchange by minimizing the negative balance of payment.
"
4587,"It is essential to launch various programmes with pragmatic policies and sound procedures in order to stimulate economic development by giving export trade a high priority.
"
4588,"2. Assessment of Sixth Plan
"
4589,"In the Sixth Plan exports could not increase as expected. As the weather was bad in the final year of the Fifth Plan, exports increased in an extraordinary manner in 1980/81 followed by a sharp drop in the next 2 years.
"
4590,"From 1983/84 even though there was no quantitative increase of exports, the income in monetary terms has increased.
"
4591,"Exports did not increase quantitatively mainly due to the following reasons. failure of exports to increase in the same proportion as the national production. agricultural goods dominated export composition and production of agriculture depended on weather. no indication of improvement in the production of industrial goods, their costs and quality level.
"
4592,"If exports are not increased during the Seventh Plan, the balance of payments will not only continue to be negative but will also bring grave consequences to the national economy.
"
4593,"In the Seventh Plan the aim is to increase exports earnings by a minimum of 2.50% at constant prices. If this aim is fulfilled earning from exports will be Rs11.64 billion at constant price during the plan period.
"
4594,"In the Sixth Plan there was a characteristic fluctuation of production and exports of exportable goods.
"
4595,"According to Table 10.01 production of all goods except raw jute increased in FY 1984/85 as compared to that of 1980/81 but production of all goods in the first three years did not increase uniformly.
"
4596,"Production of rice, maize and leather decreased in 1982/83 and increased from 1983/84.
"
4597,"Production of raw jute decreased continuously in the past years and is estimated to have increased only in FY 1984/85. Production of carpet increased from 82,000 sq. meter to 3000,000 sq. meter (366%), ready-made garments from Rs 25.40 million to Rs 32.50 million (28.00%) wooden parquette from 219,449 sq. foot to 300,000 sq. foot (36.00%), jute goods from 15,905 metric ton to 20,000 metric ton (25.00%) and leather from 12.90 million sq. foot to 18.90 million sq. foot (47.00%).
"
4598,"During the Sixth Plan period, total exports from 1980/81 to 1984/85 reached Rs 7.902 billion of which overseas exports amounted to Rs 2.751 billion.
"
4599,"In the area of annual exports, exports to India is estimated to have increased from Rs 992.00 million in FY 1980/81 to Rs 1.128 billion in FY 1984/85.
"
4600,"Exports to  has doubled in this period as compared to that at the end of the Fifth Plan.
"
4601,"Overseas exports, instead of expected growth, dropped in the first four years but some increase in exports, in the fifth year is estimated.
"
4602,"In the first year (1980/81) overseas export earnings recorded Rs 616.00 million, in the second year Rs 497.00 million, in the third year Rs 289.00 million, in the fourth year Rs 529.00 million; and in the fifth year the estimated export earnings will amount to Rs 820.00 million.
"
4603,"The trend of export trade shows an increase in earnings of Indian Currency but not in the earnings of foreign exchange.
"
4604,"A high power Exportable Goods Development and Export Promotion Council was established with the aim of launching a well-conceived programme for enhancing export trade in realization of the fact that the situation did not remain satisfactory upto the third year of the Sixth Plan.
"
4605,"This Council has chalked out a well-conceived plan and has, in addition implemented a separate plan of action for FY 1983/84 and FY 1984/85.
"
4606,"A 9-point programme was also launched under which cash subsidy was given for overseas exports. The results of 1983/84 and 1984/85 show that the new trade policy implemented during the mid-term of the Sixth Plan providing physical and other facilities boosted exports.
"
4607,"In the meantime, fixing foreign exchange rates under a basket of currency system and the appreciation of US Dollar in the international market has encouraged the Nepali exporters. Net earnings from foreign trade cannot be considered to be increasing significantly because importing goods from overseas need adequate US Dollars savings, buying power of Nepalese Currency against US Dollars is decreasing and price of US Dollar against other currencies of the world is increasing.
"
4608,"The important fact is that there should be a balance between foreign exchange requirement for import and export earnings, which in reality has not taken place.
"
4609,"Increase of imports is directly related to the increase in development activities and so increasing development activities has to depend largely on imports at this stage.
"
4610,"Against this background export trade is an important and strong medium for economic development.
"
4611,"The following will be the objectives of export policy of the Seventh Plan: Policy
"
4612,"Working Policy
"
4613,"1. Unified commodity development programmes will be planned for increasing exportable goods from agriculture, forest, industry, mining and from other sectors.
"
4614,"Production and quality development programme will be implemented for wool, raw jute, cardamon, rosin and turpentine, hand-made paper, cane and bamboo, parquette, woolen carpets, leather, stone, semi-precious stones, magnesite, lead, zinc, etc. from production stage to shipment stage. Appropriate measures for enhancing competitiveness, quality level and value added in commodity development will be adopted.
"
4615,"2. To coordinate the activities of different organisations engaged in export, promotion especially within a view to further identification and selection of exportable commodities, development of selected commodities, exploration of markets conducting studies and looking for large importing houses abroad.
"
4616,"For t~is Export Promotion Council including its committees like commodity development committee and export trade management committee will be activated.
"
4617,"Nepalese missions in foreign countries will be strengthened and activated in expanding export of Nepalese goods in external markets.
"
4618,"Organised activities will be further consolidated and made more efficient for exchange of information, and related agencies and oranizations will be encouraged to participate in national and international fairs, exhibitions, seminars, etc. organised by government and non-government agencies.
"
4619,"3. Periodic improvements will be effected on existing Jaws, by-laws, foreign exchange rates and promotion policies on the basis of assessment of the trends of export trade.
"
4620,"All procedures related to exports will be simplified, preparation of documents be systematised and the number of contact offices will be minimised.
"
4621,"4. Maximum utilization of facilities will be encouraged in reducing the transport cost of exportable goods. Additional attention to warehouse facilities at Tribhuvan International Airport, Biratnagar, Birgunj, Bhairawa and Nepalgunj and development of other physical facilities, efficient operation of clearing and forwarding activities, and improving the existing system of transport will be given.
"
4622,"Model containers will be used in opening up different routes to simplify and to make effective use of the transport processes under bilateral transit agreements.
"
4623,"Insurance system also will be simplified and made more effective.
"
4624,"5. Necessary steps will be taken to evaluate the comparative profit and loss position through both direct and indirect ways in rewarding and encouraging exporters.
"
4625,"6. Evaluate trends for smooth execution of export trade and consolidated existing institutional systems further to provide necessary information services to the exporters.
"
4626,"7. Expand production activities for the approved agricultural, industrial and mineral goods in order to make the balance of payments with neighbouring countries favourable to  and to avail of the facilities provided under bilateral agreements with these countries.
"
4627,"8. Special programmes will be launched for increasing production and export of light and high-value products on a priority basis by identifying such export-oriented products.
"
4628,"Necessary arrangements will be made to establish export process zones after proper feasibility studies. CHAPTER 11
"
4629,"DEVELOPMENT ADMINISTRATION POLICY
"
4630,"1. Introduction
"
4631,"Since administration has an effective role to play in the all-round development of the country, development administration has to be effective efficient and austre.
"
4632,"If administration can be made efficient to the required level for execution of the development activities, it will then be feasible to fulfil the set objectives.
"
4633,"Coordination among consolidated, clean and honest administrative environment, development activities and development administration is desirable and essential.
"
4634,"Therefore, administration must be made timely and effective, and be projected as the ma in axle of development.
"
4635,"It is a well known fact that attention had been given to enhance the effectiveness of administration from the beginning of planning in . The policy of bringing timely improvement in administration has been recognised in every plan.
"
4636,"But improvement in administration could not take at a desired level because of lack or pragmatic programmes, shortage of skilled manpower, lack of dedication in implementation, etc, Even though different measures for bringing improvements on an experimental basis were adopted by observing execution of different programmes according to the complexities associated with growing number of organisation and in different forms, it has been found, at the stage of implementation, to be non-effective and the desired objectives were not fulfilled.
"
4637,"It is, therefore, necessary to create an atmosphere where skill and genius of' all can be exposed for development works by taking up improvement in administration as an integrated approach in a definite area of activities, against the background of existing style and procedural system, as a sample which will produce a clear and gainful results having a favourable impact on other fields.
"
4638,"As compared to the Fifth Plan, although different government agencies have improved the respective capacity to utilize development funds in the Sixth Plan, there is still enough scope for improvement.
"
4639,"In many development projects, timely decision making process is yet to be established inspite of the fact that measures for improvement were adopted for making administrative procedures development oriented and simplification was introduced in the decision making process, Though salary of the employees was increased during the plan period willingness and morale on the part of the employees have not gone tip as desired.
"
4640,"If there is a need to increase salary in line with consumer price index, it is equally important to clearly define the authority and accountability of the civil servants, to evaluate their performance properly arid to have a system of reward and punishment.
"
4641,"This will not only upgrade their morale but will definitely have a positive effect On the execution of development activities.
"
4642,"Against the foregoing background the following policies are adopted on short-term and long-term basis in order to make the development administration more effective and execution- -oriented during the Seventh Plans.
"
4643,"2. Plan and Programmes
"
4644,"The implementation aspect is very important for a successful plan but if the plans and programmes are faulty from the planning stage implementation becomes equally faulty resulting in the non-fulfillment of the objective.
"
4645,"Similarly evaluation of the project under construction against the set objective, policy and target is an inseparable part of the processes.
"
4646,"The policy will, therefore, be to carry out the following activities.
"
4647,"a. An atmosphere of coordination among National Planning Commission Ministry of Finance and the concerned ministry for preparing plans and programmes will be established.
"
4648,"Clear-cut working system will be prescribed in encouraging the concerned institutions to participate more actively while preparing the periodic and annual plans and programmes.
"
4649,"This will help eliminate from the stage planning of plans and programmes.
"
4650,"b. 	Programme oriented budget will be introduced while planning development programmes. This system will introduce the practice of showing the relation of budget with estimated expenditure of the programme while preparing tile budget and sanctioning it which will check the Practice of budget requests with and releases being made by the concerned authorities without adequate Justifications.
"
4651,"With the aim of implementing programme oriented budgets, outlines of the feasibility studies investment estimates, benefit forecasts (benefit as a percentage of investment), implementation schedule, manpower requirement, commodity requirement, etc, will be carefully in preparing development projects.
"
4652,"c. 	Strong steps will be taken to make the proposed planning and evaluation units In the ministries which to deal on development programmes effective according, to the objectives of the Plan.
"
4653,"Under this programme various activities such as organising task force, employing personnel (having required subject, skill and expertise) in the planning and evaluation units, discourage frequent transfers, assign jobs of the concerned units only, honour the decisions of the , ministries which have to handle development projects directly, etc. will be carried Out.
"
4654,"Besides, professional know-how in the planning units in the ministry and department and in the National Planning Commission will lie developed.
"
4655,"3. Administration
"
4656,"It is essential to bring about changes in the policy of personnel, administration in order to make development administration more development oriented.
"
4657,"In line with the changing situation, necessary changes have to be made on recruitment, transfer, promotion and punishment rules for personnels involved in development administration.
"
4658,"The following considerations will be given in the field of personnel administration.
"
4659,"a. So far, educational qualification is the only basis in recruitment of personnels.
"
4660,"This situation will be improved by according proper weight to those attributes of appropriate candidates which are consistent with the needs of the project concerned.
"
4661,"b) 	In the field recruitment of technical personnel, the technical ministry will be given, the responsibility of hiring such personnel to minimise the time involved in procedural rnatters.
"
4662,"c. 	Normally, transfer of personnel from development projects will be discouraged if the concerned projects are likely to be adversely affected by such transfers.
"
4663,"d. 	Promotion, reward and punishment are important factors which influence the ingenuity and dedication of the personnel. The success of project implementation largely depends on the diligence and dedication of the personnels.
"
4664,"The basis for promotion, training,, reward and punishment should be based on the jobs executed by them and on the basis of work progress than on the basis oil their experience or their educational qualifications.
"
4665,"c. 	As long as the minimum requirements of the persons in fixed income brackets are not fulfilled, capability and dedication will, in practice, remain utilized.
"
4666,"Improvement in the salary and allowance structure of the employees on the basis of consumer price index will be effected at regular interval.
"
4667,"4. Decision Making Process
"
4668,"Decentralisation and delegation of authority are important place in making development administration more effective especially in view of the existing geographical situation and of the transport and communication system developed s o far.
"
4669,"Against this background the following policies will be adopted.
"
4670,"a. To develop the mechanism of implementation and evaluation of development programmes by establishing regional offices of the ministries handling development projects in. all the five regions.
"
4671,"5. Economic Administration
"
4672,"In the Seventh plan, the following policies will be adopted in the field of economic administration.
"
4673,"a. The present system normally awards contract for construction works for development projects to the lowest bidder after proper invitation of tender application.
"
4674,"However, this practice, logical as it seems in principle has in practice resulted in problems especially in terms of delays in construction and maintenance of quality level.
"
4675,"Past experiences suggest that inexperienced contractors who have received the contract awards on the basis of lowest bid either do not execute the contract and even if they do case of execution they dropped away midway fearing loss, even execute the contracts, their work standard is generally of low quality. In this background, institutional development will be encouraged among the local or national contractors by scientific classification of the contractors and by the practice of informing them on the estimated amount of the work while inviting tenders.
"
4676,"Economic rules and. procedures related to contract award and classification of contracts will be accordingly amended or improved.
"
4677,"b. Projects executed by His Majesty's Government fall into two categories.
"
4678,"There are projects executed under departmental supervision and project-, run by development committee, corporation, centre, company, etc.
"
4679,"Department-run projects do not provide any incentive whereas projects run under corporation, committee or company provide higher incentives. Because of this difference there is a negative effect on the willingness and morale of the employees working in department run projects.
"
4680,"c. 	Problems related with land acquisition crop up very frequently in project execution.
"
4681,"Improvement in the existing system and working procedures will be brought about by reviewing this problem.
"
4682,"d. 	District Treasury Office has been established with the aim of improving the process of approving the budgetary.
"
4683,"Ministry of Finance all such requests of ministries, departments and other offices. However, this has led to this process sanctioning of the regular budget being simplified whereas budgetary release process of development budget has not changed much as a large share of the development budget comes from the foreign aids and loans and releases on which sanctioned only after the aid portion is deposited at the centre.
"
4684,"Hence only projects having definite financial commitments will be included in the annual programme by introducing effective improvement in the tradition of providing resources from the planning stage of such projects.
"
4685,"This will help simplify the process of budgetary releases. Management oriented accounting system will be introduced which will produce data for the purpose of plan formulation, execution and evaluation.
"
4686,"A task force will be formed to recommend on necessary improvements on budget sanctioning process and accounting system and steps will be undertaken to implement these recommendation
"
4687,"6. Foreign Aided Projects
"
4688,"The following points will be considered as the guiding factors for projects to be implemented with external assistance.
"
4689,"a. While preparing the projects or programmes for external assistance. Priority should be given to the policy and objectives set by the National Planning Commission.
"
4690,"b. Projects under foreign aid will be included in the annual programmes only after the project agreements are signed.
"
4691,"c. 	Steps to identify and solve problems related with coordination and with projects execution will be undertaken to enhance the capability to utilize the available resources in full.
"
4692,"7. Revenue Administration
"
4693,"Revenue administration is very important in mobilization of internal resources for the implementation of development programmes.
"
4694,"Therefore, different steps related to organisation, training, improvement, study and administration will be undertaken to make the tax system scientific, simple and effective.
"
4695,"8. Special Effort for on--the-spot Support to l1evelopment Projects
"
4696,"If projects are not formulated with proper consideration to technical aspects, chances are that the essential services will not reach the project site and chances are that such projects will not be successfully implemented.
"
4697,"It is therefore necessary to collect information on the list of personnel supply of manpower, receipt of budget amount, supply of development commodities and distribution, authority for expenditure and sanctioning, etc. at the project site in time for execution of approved projects.
"
4698,"A system of joint approval of projects will be introduced after proper consultation among Ministry of Finance, looking into the financial resources and their source, National Planning Commission, looking into the various aspect of development projects, and Ministry of General Administration, looking into the aspects of manpower, which preparing for the budget discussions or drafting of project agreements.
"
4699,"Delegation of authority to the Secretary and other Chief Officers is given by administrative and financial rules to a certain extent. The practice is that Chief Officers are delegated authority mostly by work execution rules.
"
4700,"Unnecessary delays have been observed not only due to non -uniform delegation of authorities but also from inadequate delegation.
"
4701,"Jobs, duties and authorities will be clearly defined by regulations from the secretary down to projects chiefs.
"
4702,"Supply of construction materials throughout the country because of landlockedness and geopolitical factors, is taking the form of a big challenge. Most of the projects are not completed in time mainly because construction materials are not available at time due to several bottlenecks.
"
4703,"Therefore, for tile supply of essential goods to the projects, time -bound improvement will be introduced.
"
4704,"It has become necessary to follow the scientific methodology in new constructions such as airport, roads, buildings, channels, canals, dams, etc.
"
4705,"Attempts will be ma0c to introduce construction codes which should accompany the designs showing all technical inputs.
"
4706,"According to the principles of decentralisation, plan formulation, execution and evaluation will be carried out by town, village and district panchayats.
"
4707,"It is essential to encourage the staff of those institutions in upgrading their administrative capability by teaching the methods of formulation, execution and evaluation of the plans.
"
4708,"Hence, these staffs will be trained. The centre will also be required to delegate more authorities to the district level offices according to the necessities.
"
4709,"The concerned offices will be made more efficient during the plan period.
"
4710,"10. Miscellaneous
"
4711,"a. 	Labour and Local Skill
"
4712,"Mobilisation of Nepalese labour will be given top priority and maximum utilisation of skill, technology and the capacity at the local and national level will be taken as guiding factors for adopting this policy.
"
4713,"b. Upgrading the Capacity at Non-government Level
"
4714,"Non-government organisations have equally important roles to play as the government organisations in strengthening development administration.
"
4715,"Well managed organisations in the non-government sector can contribute a lot in carrying out non-government sector can contribute a lot in carrying out feasibility studies, surveys, designs, estimates and socio-economic surveys.
"
4716,"Necessary support to these organisations for their development, promotion and expansion will be provided during the plan period.
"
4717,"This will not only stop the outflow of capital but help to develop the capacity within the country
"
4718,"c. 	Coordination and Support
"
4719,"Lack of coordination or assistance within the same organisation or between ministries has taken the form of a major problem in making development administration effective.
"
4720,"Attention will be given to develop a practice of understanding or collecting opinions at different stages by a process maintaining coordination, consultation, and comments on plans, programmes or projects. Greater attention will be given to earn timely support for tackling the problems by a system of regular review of implementation.
"
4721,"CHAPTER 12
"
4722,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY
"
4723,"1. Introduction
"
4724,"Use of science and technology is essential for rapid economic development of the country.
"
4725,"Judicious use of science and technology will also shift the dependence from agriculture to industries while at the same time, opening up opportunities for export. The need of the hour to-day is to recognise on science and technology as an important resource of the country which is to be used in full in a planned manner as an inseparable part of the development process.
"
4726,"Various scientific instruments have to be used in the course of national economic development. Technologies which are not available in the country have to be imported from the international market.
"
4727,"Imported technologies may directly be used in the workfloor without any adjustment and technologies related to industrialisation and water resource development can be utilised as they are imported.
"
4728,"Vocations like agriculture and cottage industries can use equipments of medium scale and level. Use of such equipments, however, should not replace labour.
"
4729,"Articles such as hand made paper, radhi, suspension bridges, construction of irrigation canals, curios, Karua, Khukuri, utensils of copper and clay, cane and bamboo basket (Doka), bags, etc. have been using indigenous techniques.
"
4730,"These traditional skills must be developed and changes, if necessary, be introduced in these techniques according to the need of time.
"
4731,"Imported technologies should be studied and evaluated on the basis of their adoptability to ascertain whether changes are called for in local adaptation.
"
4732,"Search for necessary techniques and their development largely depends on the capability of science and technology of the country.
"
4733,"It is, therefore, obvious that developing the capability of science and technology of the country has to be given priority and definite programmes have to be worked out accordingly.
"
4734,"While search is going on for the new international economic order for bridging the gap between the developed and developing countries, economic aid alone is not the solution.
"
4735,"The need for technical aid is still greater.
"
4736,"Country like  should expand the know-how, skill and resource in the field of science and technology, should lay more emphasis on the search of international technical aid lather than economic aid for developing the capability for self-reliance.
"
4737,"Publicity and promotion in making the people conscious and Interested on the use of science and technology for economic development of the country is most essential, It is necessary to upgrade the capacity of science and technology, to arouse people's interest on it and to associate it in the overall development of the country during the Seventh Plan Period.
"
4738,"The policy of science and technology was clearly spelt-out in the Sixth Plan.
"
4739,"Attempts were made in all the previous plans to develop science and technology but it was only in the Sixth Plan that the basic prerequisites were developed. of Science and Technology was established in an effort to solve some of the problems related to the development of science and technology in the Sixth Plan.
"
4740,"There has been a quantitative growth in the number of professional organisations involved in the development of science and technology. of Science and Technology has contributed significantly in exchange of research information among scientists and technologists by organising national science and technology fairs, and by other such activities.
"
4741,"At the same time, these efforts have helped scientists and technologists to identify areas for research and innovations. A number of books were also published highlighting the -rate of science and technology.
"
4742,"Several studies and research works were carried out on subjects related to development in His Majesty's Government research laboratories in areas like agriculture, drugs, mineral, food and pharmaceutical.
"
4743,"In addition, research works in the field of science, agriculture, forest, engineering, medical science, etc. were also undertaken in different campuses of .
"
4744,"The Applied Science and Technology Research Centre of Tribhuvan University introduced an information services on development and expansion of appropriate technology.
"
4745,"During this plan period, high level manpower in the field of engineering, medical science, agriculture and forest has been produced conforming to the aim of self-sufficiency in technical manpower.
"
4746,"High level research activities have also been conducted in the campu ses of  on basic sciences.
"
4747,"Efforts are underway to consolidate middle level science education.
"
4748,"The progress, though satisfactory, is far from being adequate.
"
4749,"The situation calls for the need to bring awareness in the people and arousing interest in them on the utility and use of science and technology and for a continuous search for appropriate technology from foreign countries by bringing coordination between His Majesty's Government, Tribhuvan University and other organizations in developing indigenous technology.
"
4750,"The crux of the problem is that an appropriate environment is yet to be created for the development of science and technology in the country.
"
4751,"Lack, of mobilization of scientific and technical manpower, low national investment on science and technology, low level of standard of educational activities, lack of respect for scientists and technologists, lack of reliable statistics for drawing up plans and the lack of physical facilities for conducting research works are the major impediments in creating such an environment.
"
4752,"The objective of science and technology policy in the Seventh Plan- will be to develop programmes for solving these problems gradually.
"
4753,"Objective
"
4754,"1. To fulfil the national objective of the Seventh Plan by developing science and technology in the same pace as that of economic and social development of the country.
"
4755,"2. To upgrade the capability of science and technology of the country by developing scientific and technical manpower, execution of research and development activities, transfer of know-how on science and technology and by proper organizational development and management.
"
4756,"3. To expand the use of science and technology by bringing awareness to the people on its utility and value.
"
4757,"a. Determining Priority in the Field of Science and Technology
"
4758,"Priority in the field of science and technology for its utilisation in fulfilling the needs of the country will be determined on the basis of short -term and long-term considerations.
"
4759,"b. Research and Development in Science and Technology Research and development in various fields will be initiated for meeting the immediate requirement of science for developing technology.
"
4760,"Likewise, science and technology information services for dissemination of development technologies and scientific results will be strengthened.
"
4761,"Efforts will also be made to coordinate the research and development activities carried out by different institutions in the country.
"
4762,"c. 	Development of Science and Technology Manpower Training
"
4763,"Educational institutions will be provided with modern facilities for upgrading the standard of training in the field of science and technology and for its uses in the development works, and arrangements will be made to teach new subjects which are important for the country by bringing in necessary changes in the syllabus.
"
4764,"To produce standard science manpower, additional laboratories, workshop, etc. and educational materials will be supplied and training will be given for development of skill.
"
4765,"Institutions related to science and technology will expand the know-how on inter-related subjects by providing science education on technical know-how and development of skill and technology education for strengthening the base of science for promotion of both the fields.
"
4766,"To further strengthen the educational activities, researchers will be encouraged to use their experience in education.
"
4767,"Opportunities for career development will be given to increase productivity of the available scientists and technologists.
"
4768,"Modern education materials and laboratories will be established in the schools in order to improve the standard of science education from the lower level.
"
4769,"d. 	Development of Different Aspects in the use of Appropriate Science and Technology
"
4770,"Inter-sectoral technologies will be developed for adoption of different aspects of science and technology in connection with the development of the country.
"
4771,"Indigenously developed technologies will be further tested for promotion. Use of tested technologies will be widened.
"
4772,"Economic, technical and other forms of assistance will be extended to institutions engaged in the development and expansion of such technologies.
"
4773,"5. Publicity and Promotion
"
4774,"People will be informed about the concepts, utility and importance of science and technology to the day to day life.
"
4775,"Promotion and publicity will be carried out through different media (such as exhibitions, publications, talks, radio, essay competition, etc.).
"
4776,"Professional organizations engaged in such activities will be made more active by providing more facilities.
"
4777,"Seminar, workshop, etc. will be organized among the science and technology groups for the exchange of results of research and development and research achievement from different institutions.
"
4778,"Publication of scientific and technological magazines will be encouraged and for making such publications regular and of standard quality necessary assistance will be provided.
"
4779,"CHAPTER 13 URBANISATION AND HABITATION POLICY
"
4780,"Urbanisation in  as compared to that in developed countries, though negligible, has been increasing continuously from the day the concept of planning for economic development was adopted.
"
4781,"The concentration of population in the urban areas testifies to the rapid process of urbanisation.
"
4782,"The urban population and its annual growth rate has been increasing since the last few decades.
"
4783,"In the census 1952-55 urban population was 237,000 i.e., 2.80 percent of the total population.
"
4784,"In the census of 1961 it increased to 336,000 which went upto 462,000 or 4.00 percent of the total population in 1971.
"
4785,"The latest census (1981) shows that the population of the town panchayats has hit 957,000 which is 6.38 percent of the total population. By 1985/86, the population of 29 town panchayats is estimated to reach 1.360 million or 8.20 percent of the total population.
"
4786,"If the habitation of 5,000 or more people residing at one place besides the town panchayats is to be included in urban population, this will mean that 20.00 percent of the total population live in the urban areas.
"
4787,"The growth rate of town panchayats indicates that it has far exceeded the national average rate of growth.
"
4788,"If the national population annual growth rate between 1971 and 1981 stopped at 2.66 percent the annual growth\ rate of the urban population shot up by 7.00 percent.
"
4789,"If inner terai is to be included, the number of town panchayats increases to 16 and their population is 53.29 percent of the total population.
"
4790,"Before the initiation of the First Plan there were only 7 town panchayats (Biratnagar, Janakpure, , Lalitpure, Bhaktapure, Birgunj, and Nepalgunj) in 1951 - 55.
"
4791,"In the population census of 1961 the number of town panchatyats reached 11.
"
4792,"Thus Dharan, Rajbiraj, Pokhara and Tansen were added to the first seven.
"
4793,"Similarly in the population census of 1971 the number of town panchayats reached 16.
"
4794,"Ham, Bhadrapure, Hetauda, Butwal and Siddharthanagar (Bhairawa) were added.
"
4795,"The latest population census in 1981 increased the number of town panchayats to 23 by addition of seven town panchayats namely, Dhankuta, Lahan, Bharatpure, Tribhuvannagar, Birendranagar, Dhangadhi and Mahendranagar.
"
4796,"Keeping in view the urbanisation of the last decade, population growth did not take place only in the declared town panchayats but the process of urbanisation started by habitation along highways, inner terai and hilly headquarters also.
"
4797,"All these trends show that the pace of growth of urban population and population density will be still faster. With this trend, increase in the labour force also increase the pressure on the urban facilities.
"
4798,"According to the Family Budget Survey 1973 - 75, it has been found that most of the families in big towns like , Biratanagar, Lalitpure, Siddharthnagar have found it difficult to avail the minimum residence facilities.
"
4799,"Organised sewage system is available only in .
"
4800,"Special attention has to be given towards maintenance of roads in the big towns where the vehicle density is increasing rapidly.
"
4801,"Attempts have to be made in expansion of telephone services and while doing so, improvement of operation, qualitatively, has also to be considered.
"
4802,"While observing the population situation of the last decade, economic condition and current activities of the hilly region, situation of employment, characteristics of migration, Increasing population pressure in the urban area and its growth rate, rehabilitation problems, etc.,- it is clear that review of the major policies of the Sixth Plan is very essential.
"
4803,"Urbanisation and habitation policy has to be adopted on a national scale by looking into the characteristics and process of temporary or permanent migration from the hilly and rural areas to urban areas for employment, spatial problems in course of development, and extension of general services in the urban area according to urbanisation plans and their coordination, increasing habitational problems, etc. against the background of all-round national development.
"
4804,"This sort of national policy for urbanisation will contribute substantially to national development and help derive maximum benefit by proper utilisation of the investment of limited resources.
"
4805,"On the basis of these consideration, the Seventh Plan has adopted the following objective and policies: Objective
"
4806,"On the basis of analysis of the current situation of the urban areas, there is a need for a national policy for its development.
"
4807,"For a well-conceived process of urbanisation, the following objectives have been set based on a multi-sectoral approach:-
"
4808,"1. 	to develop a well-conceived and properly managed urbanisation plan of the country.
"
4809,"2. 	to create opportunity for productive employment and increased income with increased level of urbanisation.
"
4810,"3. 	to develop urbanisation as a supplement to rural development.
"
4811,"Policy Working policy
"
4812,"The following working policy will be adopted to make the objectives and policy effective:
"
4813,"1. Classification of Urban Area
"
4814,"Existing urban centres will be classified into different categories for the formulation and execution of economic programmes according geographical situation and shape of the urban areas, population and their functional characteristics and economic resources and development potentials.
"
4815,"2. Role of Local Panchyats
"
4816,"a. According to the Decentralisation Act, local panchayats will play an important role in urban development.
"
4817,"Internal resources will be utilised to the maximum extent in the formulation and execution of urban development programmes.
"
4818,"b. Arrangements will be made to provide central level technical support and related training facilities, etc. to the local panchayats for different aspects of formulation and execution of urban development.
"
4819,"3. Institutional Arrangement
"
4820,"a. 	Organisational improvements will be brought about on the basis of studies of central institutiol1s like Town Planning Central Committee, Housing and Physical Planning Depaitmel1t, Town Development Committee, and local level institutions for making them effective for development of different urban areas .
"
4821,"b. Necessary organisational improvement will be effected with an aim to develop , which is taking the shape of a metropolitan city of the country, in a planned manner.
"
4822,"c. 	Renovate the central parts of the urban area like old , Bhaktapure and Lalitpure, prepare master plan for roads, drainage, drinking water, general services for big towns of the country. with commercial and industrial importance and to execute in accordance with the master plan by coordinating the activities of the government and non-government institutions.
"
4823,"4. Investment Programme
"
4824,"a. Investment patterns will be determined by formulating long-term and short -term development programmes for different urban centres.
"
4825,"Necessary steps will be taken. to encourage participation of the private sector for execution of these programtl1mcs.
"
4826,"b. To maintain the standard of different types of general services and facilities available according to the economic status of the urban area against the available limited resources.
"
4827,"5. Employment and Skill Development

4828,"a. Necessary steps will be taken to activate government and non-government institutions which will support the creation of productive employment opportunities in the non-agriculture sector in the urban areas.
"
4829,"b. Necessary arrangements will be made in conducting skill oriented training programmes by formulating investment programmes for ,creating employment opportunities in the urban centres.
"
4830,"6. Development Centre
"
4831,"Consideration will be given to gradually develop the towns which are functioning as a development centre of the Development Regions in an orga nised manner.
"
4832,"Special attention will be given to create an atmosphere whereby the private sector is encouraged in expanding necessary physical prerequisites and other general services for the creation of productive employment opportunities.
"
4833,"7. Development of Towns and Sub-tow ns
"
4834,"a. Necessary steps will be taken on the basis of studies to be carried out with the aim of developing sub-towns or towns at crossings of  - under construction for connecting different development regions and hilly sections- and north-south link roads in order to rehabilitate the migrated population from the hills to the terai in a well managed manner.
"
4835,"b. 	Cons ideration will also be given to provide minimum facilities required for towns in order to develop existing urban areas or important habitation for rural development as well. Through the process of urbanisation, financial sources and different services for development will be distributed to the whole of the country.
"
4836,"8. Development of Housing Area

"
4841,"DECENTRALISATION POLICY
"
4842,"1. Introduction
"
4843,"After the introduction of the Panchayat System, village, town and district panchayats have been established and thus the whole of the population has become a part of the Panchayat institution.
"
4844,"With the belief that this institution, with its capacity to mobilise the local resources, can substantially contribute to the development of the country, a third sector called ""Panchayat Sector"" was added from the Third Plan to the two sectors, namely, Public and Private Sectors of the previous periodic plans.
"
4845,"In the Sixth Plan, collection of plans of village, town and district panchayats was compiled as a separate volume titled as Part II of the national plan document to reflect the aspirations of the local people by giving Panchayat Sector broader importance.
"
4846,"Similarly, with the aim of meeting the local needs as quickly as possible development subsidy was increased to Rs 56.00 million for investment in Panchayat Sector.
"
4847,"Integrated village development projects have been an important programme of Panchayat Sector.
"
4848,"Elaborate arrangements were made while formulating the Sixth Plan on the objective, policy and priority of integrated village development activities in .
"
4849,"Various steps were described in the Sixth Plan to bring about improvements in the condition of majority of farmers by bringing changes in the rural economic and social pattern', create self- sustaining development process for the rural areas, develop leadership quality by encouraging majority of the farmers to participate in the decision making process, increase the productivity by giving employment to the large unutilised rural labour force, unify and coordinate all the activities related to village development which are interdependent and complimentary to each other, and wipe out existing poverty in rural areas through the medium, of complete programming.
"
4850,"In order to fulfil these objectives, various policies were defined and the need for giving priority to fulfil the minimum amenities like education, health, drinking water along with the efforts of rural development to increase production and employment was described.
"
4851,"Though integrated rural development projects were started in the past elaborate efforts were made for the integrated rural development during the Sixth Plan only.
"
4852,"Eight such projects in 23 districts are under implementation through the joint efforts of His Majesty's Government and different donor organisations. These projects helped in increasing production, rendering social services and in creating necessary infrastructure but failed to reflect the objective, policy and priorities of the Sixth Plan, especially when these projects were formulated.
"
4853,"At the moment, there are wide gaps among these projects and these gaps are primarily visible in the areas and subjects covered by them, in priorities given in their organisational structure and in operational systems.
"
4854,"In all these projects some common problems are prominently found. First, different activities covered by these projects have not resulted in operation of programmes in an integrated manner and as complementary to each other.
"
4855,"Formulation of projects at the local level according to local needs, expectations and feasibilities have not actually translated into practice.
"
4856,"Although the primary objective of rural development is to eliminate rural proverty"" investments in these projects do not seem to have made much progress in this direction.
"
4857,"Clear-cut line of demarcation of responsibilities and coordinated relations, as expected, do not exist among differe nt levels of administration and between project management and central institutions, especially in tasks like project execution, follow-up and evaluation.
"
4858,"Consequently, greater efforts have to be put by the project management in using the medium of personal relations to secure minimum of successes in the formulation and execution of programs every year, As can be expected in such a situation, physical achievements are much below the target.
"
4859,"The policy of the Sixth Plan not being reflected in different rural development projects at the stage of their formulation is a major cause to the above situation.
"
4860,"The other cause is that different conceptions on rural development among different donors, expressed and articulated at the time of project formulation, dominated the execution stage as well.
"
4861,"Attempts were made earlier, and in the Sixth Plan to introduce the practice of formulation and execution of project in an integrated manner in different districts of  in addition to integrated rural development projects.
"
4862,"In 1974, attempt was made to formulate integrated district development plan at the district level in conformity with the district administration plan.
"
4863,"[n 1978, integrated rural development attempts were made in some districts through the medium of integrated panchayat development forms.
"
4864,"The objective was to formulate on integrated plan at district level as an inseparable part of central level plan in the Panchayat Sector giving prominence to the coordinating function of the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development.
"
4865,"The compelling need for adopting the decentralised system in planning and execution for social and economic development in line with the expectations and aspirations of the rural populace was learnt from the experiences gained in the field of rural development. As a result, the Decentralisation Act 1982 was promulgated for implementing the decentralised planning. Thereafter, in 1983, in course of formulating the basic principles of the Seventh Plan, the policy of formulating decentralised plan at the district level was fixed.
"
4866,"This has heralded the system of formulating periodic or annual district level development projects at the district itself.
"
4867,"With the implementation of the Decentralisation Regulations 1984 (from December 1984) a new background has been created for local development in the country.
"
4868,"The attempt of Decentralisation has set up an elaborate modus operandi for local development.
"
4869,"An organisation and institutional format was set-up for devising the process of formulation, execution and evaluation of plans based on the extensive participation of the populace for local development according to their wishes, ingenuity and feasibility.
"
4870,"The objectives thus fixed will require that the local populace initiate and be self-reliant for the all- round development by maximum utlisation of local resource' according to the capacity of the local community for development of the district through the medium of local leadership and organisation.
"
4871,"This will not only uplift the economic condition of the local communities rapidly but will also support the development of citizens capability of following democratic practices and carry out the responsibilities on their shoulders at the local level.
"
4872,"First, periodic or annual plans of village, town and district are formulated by Decentralisation of the. process of formulating plans for the maximisation of the local' resources by reflecting the wishes, and needs of the local people in the national plan; Emphasis is laid on institutional development by establishing local organisations which consists of panchayats and consumer committees in order to make the development projects long-lasting and meaningful ,by using ,the resource of the population and management capability~ Normally, nine service, centres will be established in a district in order to support the formulation; execution and evaluation of the plan in different areas at the village and town levels.
"
4873,"Technicians from different disciplines will be employed in each centre.
"
4874,"Similarly, at the district level institutions related to development will be converted to branches of district panchayat and will be assigned the job of formulation, execution and evaluation of unified plans.
"
4875,"District panchayats and district assemblies will determine, the necessary policies and priorities for formulating the plans and approve them accordingly and review their achievements.
"
4876,"Necessary central guidelines with regard to mobilisation of resources and their uses will be communicated in time to make feasible the formulation of plans based on local needs and ingenuity.
"
4877,"Then periodic and annual plans will be prepared for district, town and village by including the resource from the local panchayats.
"
4878,"Thus, the main base of development of district, town or village will be the formulation and execution of development plan at that level.
"
4879,"In this effort His Majesty's Government will function as an observer.
"
4880,"His Majesty's Government will assist in securing the resources from the central level and support from the national level plans.
"
4881,"3. Form of Rural Development Project and Policy
"
4882,"This arrangement will create a basic ground work for the rural development in  and will help ease problems in this field.
"
4883,"This decentralised system will enable every district of Nepal to formulate its own periodic or annual development plans.
"
4884,"Various resource and programmes will be mobilised in an integrated manner under one institution and they will be complimenting each other.
"
4885,"The policy in the Seventh Plan will be to make the process of development self-reliant by widening the base of local resource mobilisation with the use of increased resources, production and employment oriented programmes against the background of existing poverty and backwardness in the villages.
"
4886,"The policy of securing aid from friendly countries and international agencies will also continue.
"
4887,"Selection of locations for such investment will be guided by the principles of regional balance, feasibility of productive investment and a judicious distribution of resources.
"
4888,"This sort of investment will lay the foundation works of the process of progressive development by eliminating the adverse situation in the economic, social and environmental areas in different parts of the country.
"
4889,"The main objective of all these efforts of development in Nepal is to increase production, to increase employment opportunity, to upgrade the standard of social services and achievements and to promote favourable environment steps to institutionalise the formulation of decentralised and unified plans and to develop a process of execution and, follow-up to increase' the development efforts for maximum utilisation of local resource quantitatively, to widen the base of local resource for its development, to maximise the use of local technical capacity and to develop it and to develop complimentary relationship in the formulation of local and national level plans, will make the process of development at self-reliant.
"
4890,"From the experience of small farmers development project and integrated banking programmes it has been observed that small farmers benefit more from development efforts through the programmes executed through them in small groups because small and poor farmers are in majority and hence this approach has to be given priority., This will enable the small farmers increase their production and productivity and will thereby influence the national productivity favourably.
"
4891,"This will be a very important approach to economic development and to judicious distribution of fruits of development.
"
4892,"4. Some Important Conditions for the Process of Decentralised Development
"
4893,"a. It is essential to fulfil some important conditions for the success of the efforts of local development on the basis of decentralisation.
"
4894,"First, for the effective formulation and execution of the plan at the local level, the capacities of the local institutions have to be improved.
"
4895,"Specifically, collection and analysis of local level basic information is essential to determine the target of the village, town and district and to develop the capacity for formulation, execution and regular evaluation of necessary programmes.
"
4896,"National Planning Commission and its regional offices will play the necessary roles with the help of concerned institution.
"
4897,"b. Though the authority and responsibility have been decentralised to the local panchayats on the basis of the Act and the Regulations, it has become necessary to delegate authority and responsibility within the government organisation to fulfil the intention of the new system after its introduction.
"
4898,"This will enable the centre to pay greater attention to the national level policy and programmes without being entangled in local problems.
"
4899,"3. The centre will give institutional support with respect to economic, policy, technical and other necessary inputs for successful formulation and execution of plans by mobilising maximum resource in the local level.
"
4900,"Regular follow-up of successes and failures cropping up at the local level will be necessary.
"
4901,"In brief, formulation and execution of decentralisation is an important milestone for the rapid economic and social development of .
"
4902,"For its success continued political commitment is necessary.
"
4903,"It is also extremely essential that people's representatives and workers and employees alike must have full confidence on its values and conceptions.
"
4904,"CHAPTER 15
"
4905,"PUBLIC ENTERPRISEPOLICY
"
4906,"As long as the private sector investors do not take a leading role in the rapid development of the country as desired, the role of the government corporation becomes very important especially in term of developing the infrastructure, extending social services and increasing industrial production.
"
4907,"Against the background of lack of investors, lack of entrepreneurs, lack of management skills and limited professional knowledge existing in the private sector, the government corporations contribute substantially in the economic development of the country.
"
4908,"So long as the private sector does not come forward in meeting increasing demand for consumer goods for increasing population, in supply of development and construction materials, in developing minimum facilities to the people, government corporations have to undertake these activities.
"
4909,"In fact, the establishment of corporations has been the primary base for development in .
"
4910,"Corporations (59) established by the end of the Fifth Plan are adequate in quantitative and functional requirements.
"
4911,"The quantitative increase in the number of corporations which took place upto the Fourth Plan stopped in the Fifth Plan and the Sixth Plan. The conception of making the process of development effective, in the initial stage, through the medium of government corporations gradually changed and the policy has been adopted to improve the qualitative, skill and professional capacity of the corporations already established.
"
4912,"Fifty three corporations which were in operation in the Sixth Plan fall under commercial, industrial, service- oriented and infrastructure-oriented categories.
"
4913,"Among them, 43 corporation belong to first generation (100% equity participation by HMG),l joint ventures and the rest belong to the 2nd generation (equity partly by HMG and partly by other corporations). Bhrikuti Paper Industry, Lumbini Sugar Factory, Nepal Paper Industry, Butwal Textile Factory were the new corporations established in the Sixth Plan.
"
4914,"Similarly, National Rice Mill was liquidated and Chandeswori Textile Factory and Nepal Churie Ghee Factory were sold to the private sector. Nepal Standard Committee as a development committee was converted into Nepal Standard Institute as a department Radio  has been converted into a commercial organisation.
"
4915,"Attempts are underway to make Nepal TeleCommunication Corporation, Nepal Electricity Corporation, Nepal Oil Corporation and Nepal Food Corporation commercially viable.
"
4916,"Steps are being taken to amalgamate Timber Corporation of Nepal, Fuel Corporation and Forest Products Development Committee into one corporation and amalgamation of other similar corporations into one organisation is under serious consideration.
"
4917,"The contribution of the government corporations to the total national product in the first four years of the Sixth Plan has not increased.
"
4918,"In 1979/80 it was 2.30% and it remained at the same level as well, thereby suggesting an estimated annual average growth rate to be 2.10 %.
"
4919,"There has been no markedly visible increase in the sales of corporation products and so the net income has gone down.
"
4920,"Collection of dividend during the Sixth Plan from the government corporations ws estimated at Rs 400.00 million but at the market price Rs 413.00 million has been collected by the end of 1984/85 and the trend suggest that about Rs 500.00 million will be collected.
"
4921,"If the contribution of dividend from the Nepal Rastra Bank is not compiled on the basis of constant price it is not possible to raise even 25.00% of the declared dividends.
"
4922,"Even if the corporations are in such a state of affairs financially, still then, they are a major source of employment opportunities.
"
4923,"In 1979/80 there were 34,000 employed in the corporations have contributed significantly towards meeting the demands of various goods through imports.
"
4924,"The financial situation of the government corporations, as a matter of fact, is in a very poor shape.
"
4925,"In addition, plenty of short-comings in management, commercial skill and in creation of scientific organisational structures exist in the government corporations.
"
4926,"If the corporations were to control the creation of fixed assets in time and thus check the downward trend of the returns on investment, them the cumulative loss which reached Rs 850.00 million in 1981/82 and which is 40.00% of the total equity of the corporations could possibly have been avoided.
"
4927,"This dismal picture can be attributed own functions on the one hand, and the negative effects of the practice of fixing price by government, on the other.
"
4928,"In view of the rising production costs, it is likely that the situation will get worse if freedom price fixation is not allowed to these corporations.
"
4929,"The following are the principal causes for the present state of affairs of the government corporations.
"
4930,"1. Lack of clear-cut and result-oriented objectives.
"
4931,"2. Inability to make the management fully res ponsible to fulfill predetermined objectives.
"
4932,"3. Inability to develop skilled management cadre.
"
4933,"4. Making the board of directors more active and responsible by checking undue interference from the government.
"
4934,"5. Inability to liquidate or transfer the ownership of corporations not meeting the financial or economic criteria.
"
4935,"6. Inability to adopt planned measures to encourage the corporations to fulfill the objectives by regular follow- up with scientific evaluation system and to implement effectively the system of reward and punishment.
"
4936,"7. Inability to make the top management fully responsible and accountable.
"
4937,"If the required improvements can be brought about in the present state of affairs, the corporations will still have an important place in a developing country like  for developing the country's economy and in fulfillment of the needs of the people.
"
4938,"His Majesty's Government has been investing increasingly in these corporations with the view that they will prove to be meaningful and permanent medium in bringing about dynamism in the process of development and in the use of national savings for the welfare and rehabilitation of the people.
"
4939,"If these corporations are left as they are, they will not be in a position to improve their commercial viability and will be a burden to the government.
"
4940,"HMG has to bear the responsibility of providing minimum services, supply of consumer goods and creation of infrastructure and on top of it, has to provide financial assistance to the corporations already established.
"
4941,"The present conditions of the corporations must be checked and efforts have to be made in the Seventh Plan to make the government corporations play a more effective role for national economic development.
"
4942,"Against the background of the forgoing, the following are the major objectives of the policies related to government corporations in the Seventh plan.
"
4943,"1. So long s the private sector is not prepared to produce necessary import -substituting goods and undertake the expansion of infrastructures, government corporations will be developed as a major medium for producing such goods and services.
"
4944,"2. Since it is the responsibility of the HMG to supply the essential goods and basic services to the people, they will be done through the medium of government corporations in an organizes manner.
"
4945,"3. Encouragement will be given to private sector participation in the management and investment of Government Corporation and gradual transfer of ownership to them will be affected.
"
4946,"4. Steps to mobilize sources from the private sector will be intensified and the participation of the sector, through saving generated, will be encouraged in Government Corporation.
"
4947,"The following policies related to public enterprises will be adopted to fulfill the above objectives: 1.
"
4948,"Though the process of amalgamation of similar corporations has begun there are still a number of corporations which need to be amalgamated. Such corporations will be amalgamated more effectively.
"
4949,"2. A list of unnecessary of financially unviable corporations will be prepared and the process of amalgamating similar corporations, or liquidating them or transferring their ownership to the private sector will be affected.
"
4950,"3. Keeping in view of the general economic condition, level of remuneration and salary scale of similar systems, boards of directors of the government corporations, companies, bank and committees will be given full freedom to make decisions on their own on determination of salary, allowances and other facilities, appointment and promotion of employees, fixations of price of their products, capital investment, etc. based on their financial resources, economic conditions and annual profits.
"
4951,"4. Accountability and responsibility of the corporation chiefs will be clearly defined and they will be appointed, evaluated, rewarded and punished on this basis so as to improve the skill and efficiency of management in public enterprises.
"
4952,"5. With a view to safeguard the national and consumers' interest, policy will be formulated and steps initiated to control the quality of the products of corporation which have a monopoly right in productions.
"
4953,"7. Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Supplies will prepare a supply plain jointly and initiate steps to ensure supply of goods essential goods in an organised manner every years during the Seventh Plan period as the primary responsibility of the government corporations is to import and distribute in an oranised manner such essential goods for development and for the people .
"
4954,"8. Priority will be given to establish such enterprises in the industrial sector which will contribute to the goal of self - sufficiency.
"
4955,"9. Shares of government corporations will be floated widely for mobilising the savings of the people. 10.
"
4956,"Corporations will be made to submit their balance-sheets and profit and loss statements within 6 months following the closing of the fiscal year thereby enabling them to review their financial performance regularly. 11.
"
4957,"If some of the decisions taken by HMG in view of the overall national interest cause any loss to the concerned corporation, HMG will extend financial assistance to compensate the loss. 12.
"
4958,"A separate unit will be established within the concerned ministry for necessary control, direction and for providing active support to the government corporations in addition to strengthening corporation coordination division of the Ministry of Finance.
"
4959,"Participation and ownership of private sector will be encouraged in corporations which are run on government subsidy.
"
4960,"Provisions will be made to award incentives to managements which maximise profits and minimize wastes against set targets.
"
4961,"Anomalies found in the existing acts related to establishment of corporations will be corrected on a timely basis. Chapter 17
"
4962,"REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY
"
4963,"1. Introduction
"
4964,"The projects will be centred around the location where the means and resources are abundant if they are executed by giving priority to the conception of increasing national product only and there is a probability of having less attention to different means and resources in the geographical regions (Himali, Hilly and Terai) and the gap in the distribution of the fruits of development will widen which will create an imbalance and increase inequality in different regions.
"
4965,"It is essential to have a regional conception in the national plan for utilising the resources of the regions and sub- regions in order to unify the national economy by spreading the wave of development to the towns, villages suburbs etc. adopting people oriented development process in order to reduce the gap and to make the people of remote regions participate in the development activities.
"
4966,"With the aim of eliminating the regional imbalance His majesty divided the country into five development regions and accordingly development centres were established.
"
4967,"The formulation of a regional policy has been necessary to unify the socio-economic development in the geographical region sub-region by considering the feasibility of development for the people of such places east-west and north south while allocation the development investments nd execution of projects. The need for long-term projects for eliminating the imbalance be tween regions in addition to the provision of assistance for national economic development has been recognised.
"
4968,"Institutional development also is necessary for the execution of the policy matters while preparing the policies for regional development plans associating the locational aspects in the investment for topical programmes under the national topical plans.
"
4969,"Since the decentralisation plan is to begin from the Seventh plan there is a necessity of proper understanding about this plan and regional development policy.
"
4970,"Proper mobilisation of the existing means and resources has a big effect on the different regions for the national development.
"
4971,"Since the shapes of regional development will indicate the direction of development of the country important policy aspect of the regional development will be to mobilise the means and resources on the basis of local capacity necessity feasibility and skill.
"
4972,"The main objective of the regional development will be to mobilise the local means and resources for eliminating the regional imbalance.
"
4973,"2. Review of the Efforts of Regional Development.
"
4974,"The stem of planned development was initiated with the aim of increasing production providing employment and raising the standard of living of the people.
"
4975,"The Third plan gave prominence to regional aspect in the national development plan by dividing the country into watershed regions of Karnali Gandaki and Kosi with aim of balanced development by utlising the available resources of the country. As a result of the efforts of development the imbalance between village and town hills and terai grew wider and became more distinctly visible in the Fourth plan.
"
4976,"More importance was attached to the regional plan in reducing this imbalance and the principle of development alignment was abopted by selecting alignment of proposed north south roads along the traditional trade-route of Karnali Gandaki Bagmati and Koshi regions in maintaining a cordial relationship between the hills and terai.
"
4977,"This has given a definite direction to the Fourth plan.
"
4978,"But the proposal related to regional development being presented as annex could not receive recognition as expected.
"
4979,"As this proposal was based on the principles of development alignment it did not become easy for the national development to attain the set target.
"
4980,"In 1972 after His Majesty's announcement dividing the country into four development regions along with four development centres, that sort of unwanted and controversial situation was cleared a way.
"
4981,"The division of these development regions became the basis for regional investment allocation and regionalisation of some topical programmes, but it did not help other as pects as expected.
"
4982,"In the Fifth plan regional development policy was presented as a separate chapter. Accordingly the ojbective of the regional development policy is to increases national revenue by widening the foundation and boundary of development by utilising the resources in the particular region and community through the medium of appropriate methodology.
"
4983,"Therefore in the Fifth plan the objective of the regional plan was to bring uniformity in the income by increasing the income of the majority of the population based on social justice in maintaining economic and social unification and by the mobilisation of local resources.
"
4984,"The objective was fixed in the Fourth plan to execute small area integrated development programme by fixing the development alignment and giving priority to the backward areas different development programmes have to be executed by maintaining necessary coordination. Greater attention has to be given in mobilisation of local resources and means by people's larger participation in order to bring economical and social uplift of the rural areas extend adequate support in the upliftment of the development of neglected areas and economically weak communities.
"
4985,"The basic policies set in the Sixth plan are in line with the policies fixed in the fifth plan.
"
4986,"But in this plan period also development regions were brought into the sense for investment allocation only.
"
4987,"The previous far- western Development Region was further divided into two separate development regions.
"
4988,"According to the conception of regional development integrated village development programme was also executed, Bu these programmes were formulated within the limited boundaries of some predetermined regions.
"
4989,"It is possible to widen it throughout the country by gradually implementing in other regions.
"
4990,"The need now is to formulate the guidelines of a definite regional plan and programme by synthesizing the policy conceptions and guidelines of the regional plans developed in the previous plans.
"
4991,"Accordingly the policy and programmes of regional plan has been defined in the Seventh plan.
"
4992,"Objective and policy The objective of the regional development will be to involve the resources And means available in different parts of the country for the national economic development to continue the efforts for balanced development by galvanising the national level periodic plan with the local aspects implement the plan effectively distribute the fruits of development equitably.
"
4993,"To fulfill this objective the following policies will be adopted.
"
4994,"1. The utility and justification of the regional development is to develop the national and regional resources and means as infrastructures for regional development by reducing gradually the inter-regional socioeconomic imbalances.
"
4995,"2. To frame up the pattern of regional investment on the basis of development of resources and means available in different regions and sub region by mobilising them properly.
"
4996,"3. The basis of gradual reduction of the existing regional socio-economic imbalances for determinin g regional investment will be adopted.
"
4997,"4. Inter-regional socio-economic imbalances of the five development regions only will not be looked into as regional imbalances special priority will be given to the imbalances of the geographical regions Himali Hilly and Terai-also.
"
4998,"5. The development programs of the existing development regions will be executed as a basis for the feasible process of development and consolidation of north -south unification in the future.
"
4999,"The main objective of the regional programmes will be to use important plans and programmes from national point of view for the purpose of development concrete use of regional resources and means for the potential regional development initiation of the process of unification and its consolidation between inter-sub region socio -economic differences under the inter-geographical regions and development regions .
"
5000,"7. The long term utility of the regional plan will be to develop the system of planning including the national priority on the basis of regional plans in the national plan.
"
5001,"3. Situation of regional Imbalance
"
5002,"From the analysis of the situation of the regions about population. agricultural wealth and development investment the situation of regional imbalance still exists.
"
5003,"In fact because of the existing inequalities in population distribution agricultural wealth and development investment migration is taking place from the hills to the terai and effort s for increasing On the other hand problems like population increases, deforestation uncontrolled habitation in the Terai Region are taking a very ugly shape.
"
5004,"On the one hand because of inequality in the distribution of population and agricultural wealth problems like migration land erosion deforestation and uncontrolled habitation are taking the shape of a national problem on the other because of the policy of centralization in the past few plans development investment was centered around a few places where there was adequate resources and means which resulted in one sided growth of a few places and the imbalance between such places and others widened ; and due to lack of complimentary production mutual exchange of goods could not take place the total economy has been terai oriented creation of problems strong and efficient system inter regional exchange of work procedure interdependence was felt and though there has been some solutions it still remains to be a problem. Of course due to efforts in some plans regional imbalances have been greatly reduced in social services like education health postal services drinking water etc .
"
5005,"Development in health services is very encouraging.
"
5006,"Also the gap in the geographical regions is almost very small in this field.
"
5007,"Similar situations are appearing in other social services .But in other sectors the regional imbalance still clearly exists.
"
5008,"Not only the mobilisation of resources and means but also the regional imbalances demonstrates the necessity and importance of regional development.
"
5009,"4. Spatial Outline of Regional Plans
"
5010,"a. Basis of spatial outline:
"
5011,"Determination of spatial outline of the regional plans as a supplementary to the sectoral development according to the main objective of the national plan is a must.
"
5012,"Regional plan is an inseparable part of the national plan.
"
5013,"Development programmes to be formulated for each region will be on the basis of national programmes.
"
5014,"In order to make the proposed development programmes more pragmatic and effective it is essential to determine the level-wise regional development.
"
5015,"Regional plan is a long term plan.
"
5016,"Determination of level-wise spatial outline is essential for executing the long term programmes according to the objectives of the national plans formulated at different stages.
"
5017,"b. Objective for the determination of level wise spatial outline:
"
5018,"Determination of level wise spatial outline is more business-like when different regions are complimentary to each other and inter-action is more probable.
"
5019,"For this consideration most probably it is desirable to have the upper level development regions cover the north south sections of the country.
"
5020,"The degree of feasibleness of the inter action among Himali. Hilly and Terai as it exists is not found in east west direction of the same geographical region. Therefore, when different levels are determined it is desirable to have north south land masses for the regional work areas with different environment and means for the regional plans.
"
5021,"c. The existing five development regions have special characteristics of their own.
"
5022,"Even thouth in these five development regions development alignments are fixed for east west division of the country the purpose is to bring regional unification by connecting the north south regions.
"
5023,"Since sentimental attachment has been developed about the utility of these five development regions successful execution of the development programmes is possible.
"
5024,"These development alignments of the five development regions follow the historical north south trade routes.
"
5025,"Hence these alignments can be made more business like. But it wont be feasible to develop all the regions of the country as work place only by the imagination of five development regions and development alignments.
"
5026,"It is necessary to create small businesslike sub regions covering north south geographical regions.
"
5027,"In fact these sub regions will be the very workplace in the implementation of the plan.
"
5028,"It will be more pragmatic for such sub region to cover Himali Hilly and terai .
"
5029,"Formulation of the present district development plans in line with the decentralisation policy as a basic objective of the national development can be taken as the form of regional development plan.
"
5030,"The sub regions will be determined by recognising the existing Zones. Since there are more than four districts in one Zone a district will be defined as a Third level Development Region, Physical development of towns will be done in a particular manner based on the priority required of increased urbanisation.
"
5031,"This sort of development will be an inseparable part of the regional plan.
"
5032,"5.  and Service Centres a. Importance of development centres and service centres.
"
5033,"Development centers and service centres are the main axis of the spatial framework of the regional plans.
"
5034,"These centres will play a very important role in the execution of development programmes in the Zones and districts as a sub region of different development regions. These centres not only provide the necessary facilities and infrastructures to the concerned regions but also are the centres for economic and social services .
"
5035,"These centres will circulate blood in the life of the development regions sub regions and districts and development and inter action greatly depend on the role these centres will play.
"
5036,"The development of the regions in totality will be attained by these centres.
"
5037,"Without the development of these centres none of the regions will be business like.
"
5038,"Hence the regional urbanisation of the country will be a supplement of the regional plan.
"
5039,"b. Tier-wise development and service centres
"
5040,"Establishment of development and service centres according to levels of regional development is desirable.
"
5041,"If bigger centres are required for the development regions smaller centres will be adequate for the sub regions and districts .
"
5042,"Developing three tier regional institutions for development and service centres of the three tier regional development plan are desirable.
"
5043,"c. Role of development and service centres
"
5044,"There are five development centres in five development regions. Necessary system and infrastructures will be developed for enabling the development centres to play their assigned roles in all the development regions.
"
5045,"Minimum of one development centre will be established in the sub regions in each development region.
"
5046,"For all practical purposes market centres or towns as covered by the development alignment will be developed as sub regional development centres.
"
5047,"To bring rapid results in the concerned sub regions development oriented business will be concentrated in the development centres.
"
5048,"Necessary arrangements will be made to have the regional development centres by road transport.
"
5049,"Service centres will be developed in each district as a supplement to the spatial outline for the execution of development programmes in the districts according to the policy of decentralisation.
"
5050,"Normally nine servive centers will be established one in each block in each district.
"
5051,"These centres will be mostly service oriented.
"
5052,"Such centres will provide the support to the development activities along with that of sub region or Zone development enters. d. Determination of development and service centres :
"
5053,"The establishment of development and service centres will be determined on the basis of definite facts.
"
5054,"The effectiveness of the roles of these centres will depend mostly on the nature of establishment.
"
5055,"If these centres are not properly established they will neither develop themselves nor can support the development activities of the concerned regions.
"
5056,"Various aspects have to be considered while such centres are determined. In majority of the places feasibility studies are to be conducted.
"
5057,"Because of the larger investments in regional development centers are determined.
"
5058,"In majority of the places feasibility studies are to be conduced .Because of the larger investment in regional development centres though some centres are properly established it inessential to make them more active even if special programmes and additional facilities are to be given to them.
"
5059,"The following factors are to be considered in the establishment of the development and service centres.
"
5060,"a. central locality
"
5061,"b. convenience in movement
"
5062,"c. population of the catchment area physical area d. resources in the catchment area
"
5063,"e. difference in market prices f. geographical situation
"
5064,"e. Professional basis of the development and service centres :
"
5065,"The professional basis of the three tier centres will differ substantially. professional and service oriented general and administrative institutions which will influence the regional level will be concentrated in the regional development centres.
"
5066,"General and development oriented institutions and effective commercial and service oriented professions will be developed in the sub regional development centres.
"
5067,"Normally service oriented activities like education health post office police station agricultural extension programmes cooperative market will be carried out in the service centres.
"
5068,"Thus all the centres will be developed as a part of the total whole by developing different professions in the centres of different levels.
"
5069,"All the service centres will come under the catchment area of the subregion development centres which will then be under the catchment area of the regional development centre.
"
5070,"6. Role of Regional Development Centres
"
5071,"It is essential to analyse the regional means and resources and develop regional economics in a planned manner for the formulation and execution of the regional plans and programmes opne the on the spot outline of the regional development is formulated according to the above objectives and policies.
"
5072,"Only in this way the objectives of the regional development on the whole will be fulfilled .Upgrading the capacity of the regional development offices in the development centres is more necessary.
"
5073,"Development of manpower and expansion of other facilities in the regional development offices must be effected for coordinating the programmes and plans of all the regional level institutions established in the development centres.
"
5074,"7. Feasibility Study of the Regional Development Keeping in mind the fact that proper evaluation of the existing resources and means of the development regions have not been done so far it is essential to conduct elaborated surveys of agriculture forest land use livestock village industries and fuel in the initial stage of the Seventh plan in order to clearly identify the development potentials. This way by the end of the seventh plan long term plans will be ready whereby formulation and execution of the programmes can be effected.
"
5075,"Regional investment will be made on the basis of the utility of development of the available means in different regions and sub-regions.
"
5076,"In the field of social services even though the inter development regional imbalances are narrowing similar inter development regional and inter geographical regional imbalances still exist in the undeveloped development regions of Himali Hilly and Western Nepal and hence development programmes should be executed by giving to them with an aim to reduce the imbalances gradually.
"
5077,"The objective of the development programmes of the sub region or Zone within the set limits of regional development programmes is to formulate and execute the integrated and unified development programmes and they will be formulated and executed in an integrated and unified manner on the basis of means resources and needs.
"
5078,"Existing integrated rural developmentf programmes will be run as integrated and unified development programmes of the Zone level by reviewing the locational and spatial aspects. One integrated and unified development programme will implemented in each development region in the Seventh Plan in addition to the existing integrated rural development programme.
"
5079,"By the end of the Eight Plan such programmes will be implemented in all the sub regions and Zones.
"
5080,"8. district Development Programmes
"
5081,"Within the authority delegated to the districts under the Decentralisation Act for formulation and execution of development programmes formulation and execution of the district development programmes will be carried out within the set development framework for the sub region.
"
5082,"In the districts of the sub region or Zones where integrated and unified development programmes are not implemented, all the coordination of the development programmes will be carried out by the local development offices.
"
5083,"COMPUTER POLICY
"
5084,"1. Introduction
"
5085,"Computer technology was introduced to  in 1971.
"
5086,"National Computer centre was established in 1974 to cater to the increasing demand of computer services.
"
5087,"ICM 1410 with its limited capacity could not cope up with the increase in demand for computer services and hence, the Centre installed a more modern and larger fourth generation computer ICL 2950/10 in the first half of the sixth Plan.
"
5088,"Because of increasing utility of the computer, use of computer technology in the private sector has been increasing in an encouraging manner.
"
5089,"As a result, micro -computers are in extensive use in the country. Though the use of computers has increased remarkably within a limited time period, instances abound where a number of organizations have not taken full benefit from them.
"
5090,"Mainly because of factors such as lack of skilled manpower, problem of repair and maintenance, inadequate knowledge of computer technology, shortage of appropriate software, this technology has not been used to the full extent.
"
5091,"However, it is certain the use of computers will increase much more rapidly in the future.
"
5092,"For tackling the existing problems associated with the use of computers, installed or to be installed, in the government, semi-government or private sector it is essential to adopt a policy for the development of computer technology in the country.
"
5093,"2. Review of the Progress of the Sixth Plan
"
5094,"Through there was some progress in attaining some of the specific targets laid by the Sixth Plan, there is little room for satisfaction if the progress as a whole is considered.
"
5095,"Various training programs have been conducted for developing manpower on different aspects of computer technology for the promotion of its use in the country. Some successes were recorded in improvements in software packages, repair and maintenance and in improvement in hardware programs.
"
5096,"At the same time, workshop, seminar and exhibitions were organized in the last few years to make computer technology more adaptable. But even through the most modern fourth generation computer is installed in the  there is still a lot of scope for improvement in its functioning .
"
5097,"In the Sixth Plan, private sector has also been active in the use and promotion of computer technology (mostly micro-computers).
"
5098,"The private sector has been able to contribute to a certain extent in conducting training programmes for subjects related to micro -computers and to develop software package accordingly.
"
5099,"3. Objective of Development of Computer Technology
"
5100,"The main objective of developing computer technology in  is to make available reliable statistics and information in a short time frame by the use of computers.
"
5101,"Policy The following policies will be adapted to fulfull the objective set above: a.
"
5102,"Effective use of computer facilities and capacities will be made by coordinating National Computer Centre and other organisations involved in computer technology.
"
5103,"a. Computer Training : A unit will be established for conducting training programmes on computer technology under the existing institutional arrangement with the aim of producing trained manpower for future development and expansion of computer technology in the country.
"
5104,"b. Software development and research :
"
5105,"Imported software are very costly and at the same time not appropriate in the socio-economic context of the country. Hence useful software will be developed within the country itself,.
"
5106,"Also necessary arrangements will be made to export software if feasible for earning foreign exchange.
"
5107,"c. Repair maintenance and improvement of computer:
"
5108,"It is extremely necessary to repair maintain and improve the imported computers in time for their optional use.
"
5109,"For this necessary physical means equipment and facilities will be provided for the repair and maintenance unit of the National Computer Centre.
"
5110,"d. Formation of computer development committee.
"
5111,"A high-level computer development committee will be established with the participation of private sector for recommending suitable measures by reviewing the existing policies and programmes as and when necessary in order to regularise the development of computer technology. National Computer Centre will act as the Secretariat of this committee.
"
5112,"The excessive pressure on the price situation has been noticed from the first year of the Sixth plan. If the price increase was 13.40% in 1980/81, it stopped at 10.40% in 1981/82 suggesting thereby a slight improvement in the price situation.
"
5113,"In the third year 1982/83 the pressure on price situation increased once again resulting in the price rise by 14.20%.
"
5114,"In the fourth year of the plan, 1983/84 because of the drop of prices of the food and beverages consumer price increased by 6.20% only.
"
5115,"Thus the average price increase in the first four years of the plan is 11.00% per year.
"
5116,"Both internal and external factors were responsible for the rapid increase in price during the plan period.
"
5117,"Among the internal factors a sharp increase in money supply because of growing government deficit increase in prices of the goods and services provided by the government corporations increase in the rates of import duty sales tax and excise duty are the prominent ones.
"
5118,"Among the external factors international currency situation and the fast price rise in the friendly country , which has a lion's share ofthe foreign trade of  have adversely affected the price situation.
"
5119,"2. Price policy in the seventh plan
"
5120,"Price policy plays an important role in supporting the policies and programmes of economic development as my be directed by a periodic plan.
"
5121,"If unnecessary government interference takes place in the market price disturbance in the process of production and investment in the private sector will take place and the purpose of interference in the price instead of being fulfilled will be defeated and the situation will worsen. Since the economic activities of the producers investors and consumers are guided by the market prices it is necessary to determine what sort of price policy has to be adopted for rapid and in the market price disturbance in the process of production and investment in the private sector will take place and the purpose of interference in the price instead of being fulfilled will be defeated and the situation will worsen.
"
5122,"Since the economic activities of the producers investors and consumers are guided by the market prices it is necessary to determine what sort of price policy has to be adopted for rapid and balanced economic development.
"
5123,"Keeping these in mind the following price policies will be adopted in the seventh plan : a.
"
5124,"Monetary and fiscal policies will be devised and implemented.1 Accordingly the aim is set to limit the average annual money circulation at 13.00 % at the predetermined prices during the Seventh plan.
"
5125,"To fulfil the aim efforts will be centred around the medium of revenue mobilisation for the increasing resources requirements of the government sector and dependence on deficit will be gradually reduced.
"
5126,"b. Since production and investment activities of the farmers and entrepreneurs are affected by the general process of the market mechanism prices will have to be allowed to function as the correcting factor in case of economic imbalances and distortions.
"
5127,"Government inferences will not be allowed in the market prices except in extraordinary circumstances. Even if the prices of certain goods increase due to unnatural shortages encouragement will be given to meet the supply by imports without resorting to price controls.
"
5128,"2. To control Regular Expenditure within the specified limit
"
5129,"3. To make the operations of the government and the government owned corporations more effective.
"
5130,"To move in above direction fiscal policy of His Majesty's Government have to be changed.
"
5131,"If early solutions are not found resource mobilisation problems will become more crucial.
"
5132,"In this context it will be necessary to explain to the people the fiscal situation of the country and scale resource mobilisation can be adopted.
"
5133,"In the present tax structure attempts were made to raise the revenue by additional taxes rather than by developing a system of automatic increase in tax revenue. The measures which will help develop a system of automatic increase in revenue are complicated and difficult to implement.
"
5134,"Instead levying additional tax is easier and is attractive when looked at it from the point of view of short term revenue increase. On top of it steps which will eliminate tax leakage and make the tax administration effective are also complicated.
"
5135,"On the other side, almost all the taxes do not have a definite objective and no attempts have been made to do so.
"
5136,"In this tax, individual facilities and exemptions should be minimised, and income tax fixed on increase on capital income (house rent, dividend and profit tax, on capital gains and on agricultural income.
"
5137,"Capital income has not been included, in practice, in practice, in the sphere of income tax. Tax exemption is given to truck transport, partial exemption on customs duty on trucks and subsidy on the sale of diesel to the trucks by  oil Corporation.
"
5138,"In fact, capital gains should be treated as individual income and be taxed.
"
5139,"Studies should be conducted to charge income tax on the amount of capital gains in parts, and if desirable, steps should be taken to charge the tax. Justification of the existing rates of tax on company incomes will be reviewed.
"
5140,"Only one rate of tax instead of many will be applied on the company incomes as is being done in the case of individual income.
"
5141,"It will be desirable to charge the income tax on profits and dividends declared by the company.
"
5142,"To protect the tax payers from being double taxed, arrangements may be made to adjust the dividend tax with the tax liability of the shareholders.
"
5143,"It is also necessary to appraise the house and land tax system.
"
5144,"The biggest fault of the present tax system is that income from agriculture has not been included in the sphere of income tax.
"
5145,"It will be proper to charge income tax on the agricultural income at the same rate as that of the tax on other incomes. The basic lacuna for implementing the system still exists.
"
5146,"There is no scientific system of keeping the accounts for the income from agriculture at present.
"
5147,"Efforts have not been made on collecting statistics and information required for evaluating the income tax on agriculture income because no attention was given in the past.
"
5148,"Therefore, HMG has to consider this on priority basis.
"
5149,"Steps will be taken to devise a system of fixing the net annual income of all the four classes (Abal, Doyam, Seem and Chahar) of land and the net agricultural income will be adjusted against the price index of agriculture goods.
"
5150,"It would not be out of place to accept the socio economic standard of women as an indicator of development of the country because women constitute half of the population of .
"
5151,"According to the population census of 1981 out of the total population of 15,022,839 it is estimated that male population is 7,695,336 and women 7,327,503 It is evident that only an active involvement of the women a huge labour force consisting of 48.80% of the total population can accelerate the pace of development by ncreasing production.
"
5152,"Necessary opportunity and appropriate environment must be created to make women participate on the same footing as men do in the process of development of the country.
"
5153,"The women of  have not been able to fully take part in the development activities because of their uneducation ignorance and poverty.
"
5154,"The superstitions prevalent in the society and negative thinking have been major obstacles in mobilising women to participate.
"
5155,"National policy on women's participation has been adopted from the sixth plan period to increase women's participation by eliminating the obstacles apparent in the process of all round development of the Nepalese society including the women community.
"
5156,"In connection with the celebration of 1975 as the Women's Year throughout the world at the call of the United Nations the world women's convention in the city of Mexico decided ""each nation has to carry out in the government or non government sector development activities in a planned manner by formulating a national work plan on the basis of the needs and demand of the country in order to execute the national work plan on development of women"" Accordingly National work plan for women's Development was formulated under the convenorship of women's services coordination committee by collecting suggestions through various channels about the feasible and practical programmes to be implemented through different HMG institutions and non government sectors for the women's development in Nepal.
"
5157,"With the aim of increasing women's participation in every field in the socio economic development this National work plan has presented basic objectives problems and steps related to administrative and policy matters by allocating different fields such as education health employment agriculture cooperatives forest for women's development .
"
5158,"Though the programmes presented in the National work Plan have had concurrence in principle by the government and non government institutions for gradual implementation on the basis of practicability no substantial achievement has taken place so far in their implementation aspect.
"
5159,"Nepalese women are employed in agriculture sector private industry cottage industries different HMG Institutions Corporation and non government organisations.
"
5160,"Also the contribution of rural women in devoting their time and labour for agriculture and domestic work is equally important from economic and monetary consideration.
"
5161,"But because of the present practice of evaluating only the economically active women statistics related to women's participation in the total national product is very low.
"
5162,"If it is extremely necessary to properly evaluate the active women labour force from economic consideration it is equally important to widen the limited opportunity for women's participation in the process of different levels of decision making.
"
5163,"The thinking is that in all the development projects which will be formulated and executed during the seventh plan the role of women will be increased and they will be encouraged to participate more in each social and economic field.
"
5164,"The following objectives and policies will be adopted in increasing the women's participation in development activities.
"
5165,"Objectives
"
5166,"1. Proper opportunities will be provided for development of women a reservoir of huge labour force and make them efficient in their participation in each field of development in the country.
"
5167,"2. To upgrade the social and economic standard of women for their all-round development.
"
5168,"3. To make the women gradually self reliant and productive by utilising their skills and ingenuity.
"
5169,"Policies
"
5170,"1. Women population must be educated and skilled in order to carry forward the process of development in a balanced manner because education is the basic infrastructure of the all-round development of the country.
"
5171,"Since the literacy rate of women is still 12.00% only majority of women are ignorant and uneducated.
"
5172,"Therefore special opportunities will be provided to get women educated.
"
5173,"Several motivating steps will be taken to increase the admission of girls in the formal educational institutions by fixing quotas in addition to the special programmes to be launched in the areas which are considered backward from the educational viewpoints.
"
5174,"Women will be made forward looking by providing necessary facilities and by giving them training tin the field of technical and non technical subjects such as health education agriculture and engineering.
"
5175,"Employment opportunities also will be increased for such trained women labour force.
"
5176,"Vocational adult and informal education will be provided to the women in addition to the formal education.
"
5177,"2. Statistics about he health and level of nutrition and mortal age of the women reflect the standard of economic and social development Special efforts are necessary to bring improvement in women's health who have low mortal age and deficiency in nutrition as compared to the women of other developing countries.
"
5178,"Hence maternity welfare programmes will be launched as a priority project of health in the seventh plan.
"
5179,"The women do not get adequate health services. But more serious problem is that they are ignorant and do not have the general knowledge on health. since good health and proper nutrition of the family members depend on the mothers it is extremely necessary to have women actively participate in all the programmes in the field of health.
"
5180,"In the seventh plan opportunities for providing basic health services will be increased and more women will be participating in the nutrition programmes and health education.
"
5181,"To control the population growth rate according to the target of the seventh plan women will have to play an active role.
"
5182,"Women will be more involved in family planning and maternity programmes in addition to launching of programmes which will provide opportunities for education and employment for upgrading socioeconomic standard of women.
"
5183,"3. 	, being an agrarian country has more women involved in agriculture.
"
5184,"Women have a remarkable contribution in agro-businesses agro industries and small scale industries .
"
5185,"Full participation of the women power is highly necessary in agriculture programmes like agriculture publicity and promotion training use of imported seeds and chemical fertilisers improved farming techniques crop survey techniques etc executed for increasing productivity by involving the women in agriculture sector effectively. Hence participation of women will be increased, by determining the quota if necessary in various programmes such as training programmes and increasing production and productivity in the field of agriculture development during the seventh plan.
"
5186,"4. Participation of women will be increased in the field of forest also in addition to agriculture.
"
5187,"Their participation in conservation development and growth of forests will be increased. Women will be made more aware and conscious about the many sided benefits to be derived from the well managed forest resources.
"
5188,"Because women can contribute remarkably in the cooperative services their participation will be increased in different services to be provided by the cooperative organisations and in all types f training cooperative movement.
"
5189,"5. Nepalese women have limited employment opportunity in non agriculture sector and are employed in low salary jobs only .
"
5190,"Appropriate steps will be taken to create more employment opportunity and skills and training will be given in order to improve the socio economic condition of the rural women and low salaried women in particular.
"
5191,"Since semi employment is widely prevalent in the pre and post cultivating seasons the women will be properly briefed about the training and employment opportunities for encouraging them to get involved in cottage and village industries in maximum numbers.
"
5192,"Vocational training of different industries will be given for increasing their employment and necessary facilities with respect to capital and market will be made available to them and encouragement will be given to carry out these activities through cooperative organizations.
"
5193,"6. Necessary facilities and appropriate training will be given to the limited educated women labor force employed in the government and non -government sectors in encouraging many of them participate in the process of policy formulation.
"
5194,"7. Necessary facilities will be extended to encourage active participation by the non-government sector in addition to the government sector for institutional effectiveness in the programmes related to women development.
"
5195,"Since Nepal Women's Association and Women Services Coordination Committee have been playing the important roles with full responsibility for the welfare, protection and upgrading the women community, their contribution will be made more active and time bound.
"
5196,"Attempts will be made to extend the participation of Panchayat and non-government organisations in the activities of Women development by activating the Nepal Women's Association units from the village level to the national level.
"
5197,"8. Necessary amendments of acts which make the women participate in the development activities difficult are to be made and in order to upgrade their socio economic standard and necessary arrangements will be made to execute them. CHAPTER 23
"
5198,"POLICY FOR CHILD DEVELOMENT
"
5199,"Children are the future backbone of country.
"
5200,"If all round development of the children takes place from their childhood they will be capable citizens from physical, mental and intelligent consideration in the future.
"
5201,"Development of children must be considered at the national level.
"
5202,"According to the population census of 1981 child population of age group 0-14 years is 6,211,973 of which 3,227,012 are boys and 2,984,960 are girls.
"
5203,"According to this census child population is 41.00% of the total population.
"
5204,"Different studies about the situation of children conducted so far points out that child population support the family income by way of important child labor and majority of children have no access to education, health and other facilities and suffer from unbalanced diet.
"
5205,"Infant mortality rate is estimated to be still 150 for years 1,000 which is higher as compared to that in other developing countries.
"
5206,"Bringing the programmes within the sphere of the plan is very essential to coordinate inter regional programmes which are to be launched under the policy to be framed at the national level for effective implementation for the overall development of the children.
"
5207,"The national policy for the development of children will be to provide all at he possible facilities from the stage of womb to grown-up stage for their physical, mental and social development.
"
5208,"All facilities will be provided to the children of the country by promoting and gradually developing nutritious food, health, education and other social and economic services. The policy to be adopted for the development of children within the Seventh plan will be as follows.
"
5209,"Objectives
"
5210,"1. To develop the children physically, mentally and intellectually.
"
5211,"2. To develop good behavior from the childhood for making the children loyal to the crown, patriotic, disciplined, moral and efficient citizens.
"
5212,"3. To develop the sentiments of the children attached to the recognition of the values based on Nepalese culture and heritage.
"
5213,"4. To make necessary arrangement of protecting the interest and rights of the children.
"
5214,"1. Since the bright futures of the children depend on the parents and guardians, the parents must acquire the first hand knowledge and skill which will be imparted to the children.
"
5215,"It is possible of provide necessary food, medical care and proper education to the children if the existing superstitions and ignorance can be eliminated from the Nepalese society. Publicity and promotion will be carried out for educating the parents for upgrading their knowledge and skill through short -term training, posters, pamphlets and bulletin s for care, health and education of the children and such programmes will be included in health worker, child hospital and maternity welfare programmes.
"
5216,"Since child care in not only the responsibility of the parents alone but of the community also, efforts will be made to have public participation in such programmes.
"
5217,"2. A healthy mother gives birth to a healthy body.
"
5218,"Since formation of a baby takes place in the womb of the mother, pregnant women need periodic health check, medical care and nutritious food. attempts will be made to make the currently executed programmes for free medical care and child care in the village accessible to pregnant women and mother of newly born babies.
"
5219,"3. Since infant population of age group 0-5 years is vulnerable to diseases and children of this age-group have to be injected against epidemic diseases, D.P.T., B.C.G., vaccinations and polio vaccine and feeding programmes will be expanded and made effective. The system of making medicines for common disease such as cholera, etc. easily available will be introduced.
"
5220,"4. Essential medicines like gripe water and others will be made easily available at the local health posts for improving health of the rural children and special observation will be carried out about the situation of health and nutrition of the children through the community health workers.
"
5221,"For improving the existing nutrition level of children treatment of children having under-nutrition and sales and distribution of nutritious food at proper price for making nutritious food available to the children will be organised.
"
5222,"Since programmes related to nutrition are multi-faceted and health, agriculture and education programmes are primarily involved, coordination will be maintained among the concerned institutions. Promotion and publicity activities on priority basis will be carried out through poster, documentary and radio in dissemination the information about nutrition.
"
5223,"6. Expansion of appropriate and properly managed medical services will be effected for the health car of the children on the basis of nutrition system.
"
5224,"Studies will be made to identify the factors which cause the students of the pre-primary and primary schools dropping out and necessary steps will be taken to discourage such actions accordingly.
"
5225,"8. Proper care is essential for the well being of the physical and mental condition of the basis.
"
5226,"It has become necessary to open day child care centres in an institutional manner for leaving the basis in the healthy and protected places for the working mothers.
"
5227,"At the moments the number of such centres established in the urban areas is negligible and hence they will be opened in the urban areas and gradually spread to rural areas in the Seventh Plan.
"
5228,"For opening the day child care centres the basis of 25 worming women in one organisation in the industrial estates and in other areas according to population density and the HMG regulations. In the day child care centres babies of 45 days to 3 years of age will be taken care of and nutritious food, primary health facilities and educational toys will be provided.
"
5229,"Non-government sectors and private sector will be encouraged to participate more in opening of the day child care centers.
"
5230,"9. Books, magazines useful for the children will be published for propagating national feeling, national festivals, culture, language, customs and other activities in addition to teachings for bringing out the latent ingenuity of the children.
"
5231,"Children library, educational child documentary and children swimming pools will be opened for the development of physical and intellectual capacity of the children.
"
5232,"Libraries in the primary and middle schools and swimming pools based on the children density will be established.
"
5233,"Orphan children will be given skill oriented vocational education in addition to general education in order to make them capable citizens of the country.
"
5234,"Bal Mandir, S.O.S. villages, Paropakar Organisations will be improved and expanded to take proper care of the orphan children. 12.
"
5235,"Disabled and insane children will be provided with free education and supplied with free course books by giving them skill-oriented programmes in order to rehabilitate them under special education progammes.
"
5236,"13. to safeguard the welfare and security of the children by law child legislation will be formulated and existing acts will be accordingly amended. 14.
"
5237,"Government and non-government organisations are involved for running the programmes related to children development because they are many sided.
"
5238,"Since there is no coordination among the various projects Project to project and inter-regional-under one institution to the exten required project are passing the buck to each other and programmes have not been executed in other areas. 15.
"
5239,"Internal and inter-regional coordination will be maintained effectively by adopting unified process of programme execution in the planned development activities for children development.
"
5240,"Special attention will be given to encourage non-government social organizations actively participate in the execution of programmes which are useful to the children and for the welfare of the children.
"
5241,"CHAPTER 24
"
5242,"AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT
"
5243,"There are indications that the national production target of agriculture sector in the Sixth Plan will be fulfilled.
"
5244,"But weather is still playing a direct role in target fulfilment and the situation demands that efforts to increase production should be made all t he more extensive in view of population growth and its impact on consumption.
"
5245,"Since agriculture accounts for almost 53 percent of national production and it has still to continue providing employment opportunitie s on a massive scale, the need to assign priority to agriculture sector from national point of view remains conspicuous.
"
5246,"1. Review of the Progress of the Sixth Plan Fulfilment of target is very important in view of the fact that agriculture is the main means of livelihood for the majority of population an it has major contribution to national earnings of the country.
"
5247,"Physical progress as compared to target in agriculture development during firs four years of the Sixth Plan period is presented below .
"
5248,"The target of foodgrain production was set at 4.346 million metric tons.
"
5249,"But achievement did not exceed 4.289 million metric tons during the first four years. This means an achievement of 98 percent of the plan target.
"
5250,"Production of major food crops is presented in the Table 24.01.
"
5251,"But compared to the productivity during the year preceding the commencement of the plan period, paddy, wheat and berley have recorded some increase in productivity whereas maze and millet have lagged behind.
"
5252,"The progress situation and productivity of the cash crops are presented in the Table 24.03 and Table
"
5253,"24.04 Among cash crop, the production of sugarcane has been 79.00% of the target and oil seeds 70.00%.
"
5254,"The production of jute and tobacco also lagged far behind.
"
5255,"This is attributed to inferior quality of the product and the fact that the farmer did not secure the proper price. The production of potatoes has exceeded the target.
"
5256,"Though the statistics of production of vegetables, fruits, fish, meat and milk have not been systematically collected, concerned technical estimate indicates that the progress has been according to the plan target. Details of the progress are presented in the Table 24.05 and table 24.06
"
5257,"The progress in supplying agriculture inputs in the first four years of the plan period for fulfilling production targets is cited in the Table 24.07. Though the sales and distribution of the agriculture inputs have increased as compared to the initial years of the plan, they fell far behind the target during the plan period.
"
5258,"The main reason for this is that the production inputs and services did not reach the farmers in time. as per schedule because of the weak management and shortfall in irrigation as compared to target.
"
5259,"Moreover, farming still depends largely on weather and appropriate technology have not been developed.
"
5260,"There is plenty of scope to increase production if irrigating facilities along with production inputs can be provided to the farmers in time.
"
5261,"The progress in the distribution of improved variety of livestock is presented in the Table 24.08.
"
5262,"Distribution of ox, he-buffalo, goats, sheep, exceeded the target in the field of improved livestock .But distribution of chicks, yak and pig fill short of the target .
"
5263,"On analysis of the progress situation of the Sixth Plan and obstacles observed during development o agriculture the following points desire consideration :-
"
5264,"1. Improved seed was not widely used and its supply was not made in time and according to target.
"
5265,"2. Slow pace of development of irrigation and under-utilization of the existing irrigation capacity .
"
5266,"2. Background of seventh plan
"
5267,"The objective of development planning is to increase production as far as possible through the maximum use of limited resources and means and the available infrastructure.
"
5268,"The government sector has an important role in encouraging the large number of farmer families of the country in role in encouraging the large number of farmer families of the country in influencing the decision making process for the mobilization of resources in the private sector.
"
5269,"The field of production has to be classified on the basis of feasibility of increasing agriculture production by concentrating the use of the limited resources and means in foodgrain crops, fruits, vegetables, fish, livestock in feasible areas.
"
5270,"Programmes should be launched as a campaign by giving foodgrain top priority and by dividing the arable lands into production blocks for fulfilling the needs of the increasing population and production services and other facilities should be made available to the production block for encouraging the farmers.
"
5271,"It is possible to increase production if technical services like distribution system of irrigation water, chemical fertilizer, improved seeds, agriculture loan, crop protection, etc. which support the production programs, are made available to the production blocks according to the needs of the farmer and in time.
"
5272,"Though irrigation has been re cognized as one of the important requisites for increasing agriculture production intensive farming has not been able to move ahead because of delay in the expansion of irrigation facilities and the use of the available techniques. Development of all the feasible sources of irrigation as a campaign has been essential.
"
5273,"Increasing production by the use of available techniques widely in the areas where irrigation facilities are available is necessary.
"
5274,"It is also necessary to give additional attention to supply agriculture inputs by reconsidering the sales and distribution of improved seeds throughout the country through institutional channels responsible for supplying improved seeds to the farmers according to the requirement. The improved seeds sales and distribution must be encouraged by producing the seeds at the farmer level.
"
5275,"It is essential to organize the technical services such as agriculture extension, crop protection, soil test, crop technology services and seed inspection and certification in order to execute the agriculture program for producing seeds in a systematic manner and on a wider scale at the farmers level and to make the agriculture research simple, practical and target oriented .
"
5276,"Keeping in view the fact that farmers have not been attracted for additional investment in the absence of proper market and price incentives system, and production and productivity have increased wherever improved techniques were used, it is extremely necessary to provide reasonable prices and marketing facilities.
"
5277,"Even through production of milk, meat, eggs, fish, fruits has been estimated to be good, their import to a certain extent still exists.
"
5278,"If it is necessary to give special emphasis to give commercial touch to the fruits and livestock business in order to improve the decaying economic condition of the hills and for strengthening the inter-relation of hills and terai on the basis of geographical feasibilities for increasing agriculture production, it is equally necessary to enhance self -reliance by increasing the foodgrains production in the hills by utilising feasible hill bases to the maximum because transport problem will not be solved in he immediate future for supplying the foodgrains to the Hilly Region.
"
5279,"Executions of programmes for increasing national earning is extremely essential for increasing production in the Terai Region because this area is more feasible for foodgrain and industrial crops.
"
5280,"Land reform programme should be formulated and so directed that it will create atmosphere for attracting investment for increasing production because utilisation of agriculture land has a major influence in agriculture production.
"
5281,"In spite of the fact that land owner exceed the land tillers in number, farming has not taken the shape of commercial farm.
"
5282,"Since regional balance has not been maintained by diverting the savings from agriculture to industrial sector, the land reforms programmes should be carried forward in order to develop institutional farming by encouraging the arming on contract, etc.
"
5283,"It won't be possible of attain the target in the absence of the systems which will scrutinize plan and programmes and projects for fulfilling various production targets, their execution according of the target within the deadline, obstacles and problems during execution, achievements, forms of future plans and programmes.
"
5284,"The process of evaluation and monitoring should continue and this process should cover from the project level to the national level on a regular basis. In order to make the evaluation and monitoring of plans effective it is essential to integrate it with the reward and punishment system.
"
5285,"By mobilisation of the local leadership agriculture programmes can be executed in a more effective manner because agriculture programmes are the programmes of farmers' clear cut participation.
"
5286,"Formulation, execution, follow-up and evaluation of agriculture development programmes to be executed in each district should be done at the district level by organising a production group consisting of representatives from all institutions related to agriculture in each district and also system of execution, follow-up, evaluation of agriculture programmes through the service centres by the production group should be introduced from the district level itself. 3. Objective of the Seventh Plan
"
5287,"The target of production of foodgrain has been fixed by including quantity of foodgrain required for population growth rate, increase in income and also for export.
"
5288,"The existing per capita consumption of foodgrains of 159Kg. will be increased to 174 Kg at the end of the Seventh plan.
"
5289,"The production target of foodgrain, cash crops, fruits, fish, meat milk and major agriculture production is presented in the Table 24.09 and Table 24.09(a)
"
5290,"1. Crop programme:-
"
5291,"Keeping in mind the increasing internal demand and quantity required for export, the following special arrangements will be made in order to launch the production programme for main foodgrains like paddy, maize and wheat in the form campaign
"
5292,"1.1 	Productive inputs like ferilisers, seeds, insecticides, agriculture loans, etc. will be delivered at site in the production spots in the special and pocket regions according to the priority of the programmes for increasing the production.
"
5293,"In other areas these inputs will be supplied to service centers before the farming season.
"
5294,"For this purpose distribution of production inputs will be carried on in different areas under the following classifications:- large areas with irrigation facilities will be called special areas, small and scatterd areas with irrigation facilities will be called pocket areas, and those without irrigation facilities and dependent on monoon where increase in production is feasible will be called general regions.
"
5295,"Areas that can not be directly served under the programme will be classified as other regions, for crops other than paddy, maize and wheat in the special, pocket and general areas agriculture inputs and services will be allocated area-wise on the basis of feasibility. Paddy Production Programme
"
5296,"iii) 	Irrigation water - Water distribution working groups with the public participation will be organised for distribution of irrigation water through the irrigation drains / canals keeping in mind the fact that only timely supply of water can improve productivity.
"
5297,"Necessary arrangement will be made when government irrigation projects are regular repaired and maintained to see to agriculture works are not adversely affected.
"
5298,"By completing tube-well boring and small irrigation works and drain construction works additional irrigation facilities will be provided to 20,000 hectares of land every year.
"
5299,"e. 	Thus 560,000 metric tone of paddy under special programmes 595,000 metric tons under pocket programmes and 839,000 metric tons under general programmes add up to 1,994,000 metric tons from the areas covered by those programmes wih 1,406,000 metric tons from other areas not directly influenced by those programme s this makes a total of 3,400,000 metric tons of paddy.
"
5300,"Annual break-down of the target of paddy production during the Seventh Plan is presented in Table 24.10
"
5301,"Maize Production Progamme
"
5302,"Maize occupies the second in the overall production o foodgrains in the country.
"
5303,"There is no room for expanding the area of maize crop also and so emphasis has to be given or the increase of productivity in particular.
"
5304,"To execute the maize production program as a campaign the target of producing 936,000 metric tons from 556,000 hectares is fixed for the plan period.
"
5305,"As compared to the base year this programme will produce additional 73,000 metric tons of maize .
"
5306,"For fulfilling this target the existing productivity of maize of 1,52 metric tons per hectare will be increased to 1.65 metric tons per hectare.
"
5307,"To increase the maize production according to the target from this programme the following steps will be taken : a.
"
5308,"Maize crop development also will be executed by dividing programme into special pocket general and other programmes .
"
5309,"Special program will be implemented in valley maize area in the hills and winter and spring season maize areas in the Terai.
"
5310,"Similarly in hilly and terai areas where transportation facilities exist summer maize will be cultivated under pocket programme and in other areas in the hills services will be provided by the programme to 216,000 in the hills services will be provided by the programme to 216,000 hectare under general programme and he remaining areas under other programmes.
"
5311,"Available resources and means will be mobilsed according to priority under special pocket general and other programmes.
"
5312,"The required quantity of improved seeds will be supplied to the special and pocket areas through institutional means.
"
5313,"The required quantity of seeds for the general programme will be supplied by the private sector by supplied by the private sector by supporting the seed breeding programme. 20% of the certified seeds required by the seed men programme.
"
5314,"Other seeds will be supplied by farmers them to seed breeding programme will be carried out under seed processing and development programme.
"
5315,"Maize mini-kit programme will be implemented in order to popularise the use of improved seeds and techniques.
"
5316,"ii) Crop protection - Crop protection services will be made more effective because maize production is greatly affected by insects.
"
5317,"Crop protection units and service centres will be made active in saving the losses for increasing the production by observing the use of chemicals in the soil prior to farming and when the plants grow. iii) 	Chemical fertilisers - There is no two opinion that soil should contain nutritious elements for increasing production.
"
5318,"Priority will be given to the use of chemical fertilisers in connection with soil nutrition according to the intensively of the programme.
"
5319,"In the special areas the proportion of nitrogen and phosphorous will be 90L\:45 kg. for he Terai Region and 60:30 kg per hectare in the Hilly Region. Similarly under normal programme nitrogen will be supplied at the rate of 23 kg per hectare to a minimum of 50% of programme area.
"
5320,"Special programmes will be implemented o encourage the use of compost fertiliser to maintain the quality of soil .
"
5321,"In other regions use of compost fertilisers will be emphasized.
"
5322,"d. 	In the Terai Region extension of tube-well irrigation to 50,000 hectares and other minor irrigation to 10,000 hectares will bring a minimum of 12,000 hectares for winter and spring maize and raise production by 36,000 metric tons.
"
5323,"Fro m the above mentioned approach under special area 86,000 metric tons under pocket area 89,000 metric tons under general programmes 351,000 metric tons and under her programmes of 390,000 metric tons making a total of 916,000 metric tons of maize will be produced during he plan period.
"
5324,"The target of this production according to development regions and geographical sub-regions is given in details in the Table 24.13.
"
5325,"Wheat Production Programme
"
5326,"Wheat occupies the third place in the overall production of foodgrains in he country.
"
5327,"In the campaign for raising production of foodgrains production of wheat also has to play a significant role. target is fixed to produce 900,000 metric tons from 563,000 hectares by raising both the area and productivity in the plan period.
"
5328,"Accordingly 300,000 metric tons of additional wheat will be produced during the plan period.
"
5329,"For his production growth productivity of 1.37 metric tons per hectare in he base ear will be raised o 1.60 metric tons power hectare in the final year of the plan period.
"
5330,"To increase the wheat production according to the target from this programme the following steps will be taken :- a.
"
5331,"There is enough room to expand the area under wheat cultivation and additional production can be attainder 126,000 hectares which may be added by the new irrigation system.
"
5332,"b. Since the need to increase productivity has to be empasised as expansion of area alone would notadequately increase production, in the special area the base year productivity of 2.95 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 3.20 metric tons per hectare in he final year of the plan period in he pocket area productivity of 1.70 metric tons will be raised to 2.30 metric tons per hectare in the general area 1.38 metric tons per hectare will be raised to 1.46 metric ones per hectare and in other areas production will be raised from 0.58 metric tons per hectare to 0.66 nitric tons per hectare.
"
5333,"Emphasis is o be given for selecting new varieties and their uses because continuous use one variety of seed brings deterioration in quality and vulnerability though improved seeds are mostly used in wheat cultivation Rs 29 has aided a big popularity.
"
5334,"Bu the decline in productive and resistance capacity of this variety compels its replacement.
"
5335,"For the Terai Region emphasis will be given in he use of varieties like Tribeni Lumbini Vinayak Vaskar and Siddhartha. Use of UP 262 and Tribeni will be emphas ised in the hills.
"
5336,"In he higher altitude use of term 52 because of its popularity will be encouraged mini kit programme will be implemented for he wheat also in order to populraise the use of new seeds and techniques.
"
5337,"Major portion of the seed supply will be met by the private sector by making seed inspection and certification services active through the seed breeding programmes.
"
5338,"Emphasis will be given to encourage seeds through institutional seed distribution when old variety of seeds have o be replaced.
"
5339,"Since it is not possible to produce adequate quantity of certified seeds in the government farms alone during the plan period selected seed producing farmers will be associated in the production of seeds.
"
5340,"This way 5,000 metric tons of certified seeds will be produced at the central level.
"
5341,"Special emphasis will be given to encourage use of adequate wuantity of chemicl fertilisers in improving productivity.
"
5342,"Awareness will be brought for continuous use of compost fertilisers for maintaining the quality of soil.
"
5343,"In the special area the use of nitrogen phospherous and potash will be gradually increased to reach 80:40:20 kg per hectare during the Sevenh plan period. in the pocket area 60:30:20 kg. per hectare in the general area 50:25:0 kg per hectare andin other areas effors will be made for increasing the use of fertilisers.
"
5344,"iii) 	Irrigation water
"
5345,"Wheat crop does not need continuous suppl of water but water is needed at rhe right time. Hence water users groups will be organised with the participation of the people in order to make the effetive distribution of water from te irrigation project .
"
5346,"Coordination will be brought aout between irrigation programme and agriculture programmes to avoid hampering the farming during the period ofrepair and maintance of irrigation projects.
"
5347,"In additionto normal irrigation programmes since the aim is to irrigate 40,000 hectare by construction of small irrigation schemes in th hills and irrigate additional 60,000 hectares by tube well boring and constructio n of small irrigation projects in the terai Region in winter wheat crop will receive 25% of water from the construction of irrigation projects and 60% from the tube well .
"
5348,"In the additional irrigated lands providing production services facilities in a package from to the farmer will help support the efforts for sel reliance by producting additional 14,000 metric tons of wheat in the hills and speeial contributionwill be masde in increasing production by producing additional 40,000 meric tons in the otal target of the terai.
"
5349,"c. 	With this production programme prodction of 272,000 metric tons from special programme 241,000 metric tons from pocket programme and 256,000 metric tons from general programme will make a toal of 769,000 mtric tons.Adding 131,000 mteric tons to this from the areas not receiving the services the total will be 900,000 metric tons.
"
5350,"The target of annal production of wheat during theSeventh plan period is persented in the Table 24.16 Table 24.17 and Table 24.18.
"
5351,"d. 	Millet/Hog Millet Production Programme
"
5352,"e. 	Mostly millet / hog millet used by the low income group as a daily food are clutivated in less fertile arcas in the hills.
"
5353,"Since improved techniques have not been developed for this crop its productivity has been dwindiling.
"
5354,"Hence assuming that the area will not expand during theplan period the traget is fixed at produce 120,000 me5ic tons from 124,000 hectares of land.
"
5355,"The following steps will be taken to increase the production :-
"
5356,"a. Production inputs and services required or millet crops will be supplied under e general programme through the nearest service centres in a package from.
"
5357,"For executing the programme successfully planing monitoring evaluation and other measures will also be taken for this crop as necessary.
"
5358,"b. By the third year of the plan new variety of seeds will be selected and programme will be implemened from the fourth year.
"
5359,"c. 	Mini-kit programmes wll be used fror popularising the variety of seeds presently recommended and vrieties recommended for the hilly regions.
"
5360,"e. 	To protect the crop from the diseases development of disease resistant seeds will be emphasised.
"
5361,"Annual production targets of millet according to millet production programme during the plan period is given in the Table 24.19.
"
5362,"Barley Production Programme
"
5363,"Barley also is one of he crops cultivated in less fertile land.
"
5364,"There has been no improvement in the area, production and productivity of the erop because improed techniques have not been applied to this crop so far.
"
5365,"Assuming that there will be no expansion of land production target of 25,000 meric tons is fixed from the area of 25,000 hectares.
"
5366,"For this production programme base year productivity of 0.90 metric tons per ecare will be rised to 1.00 metric ton per hectare during the plan period.
"
5367,"The following steps will be taken to fulfil the production target :-
"
5368,"a. Necessary prodction inputs and services for this crop will be made available under the general programme through the nearest sevice centres in coordinated way.
"
5369,"b. By the third year of the plan selection of improved seeds will be completed and emphasis will be given to use the selected seeds as much as possible. Selected seeds will be tested approved by the farmers at the farmer's levels.
"
5370,"Parent seed required for this and the certified seeds will be produced by the government farm and stations.
"
5371,"Mini-kit programme will be implemented for popularising te use of recommended seeds.
"
5372,"c. 	Hilly crop development unit will be helpful for development of bck wheat barley etc.
"
5373,"d. 	To protect the crop from rust disease and black smut use of disease resistant seeds will be encouraged .
"
5374,"Annual production targets of sugarcane according to the sugarcane production programme during the Seventh Plan period is presented in the Table 24.25
"
5375,"Cotton Production Programme
"
5376,"Attaining self-sufficiency in production of cotton, an important surce for the production of clothings as one of the most basic and essential goods, is very necessary.
"
5377,"Progarmme for the production of cotton has been so designed in the Seventh Plan that Hetauda Textile Factory, other factories adn small cloth processing units will be self sufficient and will not have to depend upon the import of cotton.
"
5378,"In the plan period, base year area of 1,100 hectares and production of 1,600 metric ton will be raised to 10,000 hectare and 15,000 metric tons, respectively.
"
5379,"The following steps will be taken to produce cotton of fulfil the proposed production target in the Seventh Plan:-
"
5380,"a. Tea production programme will be clssified into special and general programmes.
"
5381,"Programme will be implemented by giving priority to cultivation of cardamon in Ilam, Raphlejung, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Thehrathu, Bhojpur and of jeera in Dhading.
"
5382,"b. Production inputs and other facilities will be provided to this proga\ramme in the form of a special programme through the nearest service centre under the supervision of the district production teams.
"
5383,"c. 	Marketing of selected improved seeds will be done by the farmers under technical supervision by encouraging them to produce the required seed. But, in case of Jeera, seeds will be imported and cultivation will be encouraged in the specific areas only for which seed will be marketed by the spices crop programme.
"
5384,"d. 	Necessary services and facilities will be made avilable to deliver the spices producd by the production groups established for the maketing of those spices to the urban areas through the market development programme.
"
5385,"Increase of export in collaboration with Trade. promotion Centre will be emphasised after attaining self sufficiency in the productionof dhania, garlic ginger, dried ginger, turmuric, cardamon, by Developing the techniques for export, producton and processing and by improving existing publicity and extension service, training programmes.
"
5386,"Special emphasis will be given to produce green chilly for self sufficiency and for substitutionof increaqsing import of green chilly.
"
5387,"Purification process at Biratnagar center will be strengthened for providing collecting services at Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari , Saptari, Siraha and Hetauda center for providing collecting services at Dhanusha, Mahotari, Sarlahi, Rautahat, Bara, Parsa, Makawanpur and Sindhuli.
"
5388,"One such industry will be established each in Ilam, , Solukhumbu, dolkha, Sindhupalchok, Rasuwa, Sinduli, Kavre, Lalitpur, Nuwakot,
"
5389,"For the seeds required for the areas covered by the district programme will be supplied by making self-sufficient with increased production at the farmer level by providing agriculture programme services.
"
5390,"3. Foundation seed required for increasing seed production will be supplied from production of different agriculture farms and stations for shortfalls. if any the selected farmers will been courage to produce certified seeds by providing necessary services.
"
5391,"The existing practice of subsidy and loans which are being made available for promoting storage in the hilly areas is emphasized by foodgrains production programme for storage of seeds for supporting the supply of improved seeds at the local level.
"
5392,"The institutional marketing and distribution and seed breeding programme according to different main crops for the proposed production of improved seeds will be as presented in the Table 24.63 / 25.64.
"
5393,"It is very necessary to use fertilisers to maintain the level of nutrients in the soil because these nutrients in the soil have major contribution in increasing productivity of the agricultural crops from the limited land.
"
5394,"1. Use of Compost Fertiliser Emphasis will be given to increase the availability and use of compost fertiliser in all the programme areas because its use not only maintain the quality of the soil but also vive nutrients to the crops.
"
5395,"Against this background where chemical fertilisers are becoming costly publicity and promotion of techniques for preparing and use of compost fetiliser will be carried out for enriching the soil by nutrients by the use of compost fertilisers.
"
5396,"Establishment of compost fertilisers plants will greatly support the marketing and distribution of quality compst fertiliser.
"
5397,"Transport subsidy on the basis of recommendations of the technical committee will be given for maximum use of quality compst fertiliser and qanimal fertiliser by reducing the imported fertiliser.
"
5398,"2. Use of Chemical Fertiliser
"
5399,"Since chemical fertiliser is not produced in the country and there is less possibility of producing it in adequate qnantity in the near future, it is essential to use it in the most judicious manner to gain maximum benefit from limited supplies.
"
5400,"The policy ofgiving transport subsidy will be adopted according to the production programme for increasing production from the areas which do not have transport facilities.
"
5401,"In the special and pocket areas where irrigation facilities exist provision will be made for supplying chemical fertilisers.
"
5402,"The policy will be grant some concessions on the price of chemical fertilisers where the farmer will be encouraged to use in the new areas.
"
5403,"3. Availabilty of chemical fertilisers will be ensured according to the priority fixed by the crop programme before the season by strengthening the supply and distribution of chemical fertiliser.
"
5404,"Agriculture Loan
"
5405,"Special emphasis will be given to exe cute loan and investment for giving benefit to at least 59% of the farmer families in the Seventh plan.
"
5406,"Loan and investment programme will be executed as a composite package with special priority to the irrigation facilities, agriculture implements marketing processing in supporting the fulfilment of target during the Seventh Plan.
"
5407,"Special emphasis will be given to make loans available to the fruits farming considering the requirements from the plantation stage to the production stage on a long term basis in a package.
"
5408,"To increase the production capacity of the small farmers small framer development project will be extended to all the 75 districts and its number will be increased to 230 during the plan period by investing on the programme which will generate opportunities for employment to improve the economic condition of the small farmers.
"
5409,"While employing workers in such small farmer development projects 40 workers will be women and in the new projects 25% of the workers will be women for increasing the women participation.
"
5410,"Thus the existing projects and the new projects will be encouraged to function as an autonomous body for which small farmers will be encouraged to run the project as a cooperative or an association.
"
5411,"While executing the loan and investment programme due consideration will be given to disburse the loan to the farmers ahead of the farming season.
"
5412,"These loans will be disbursed to the farmers on the spot in the special and pocket programme areas .
"
5413,"The policy will be to invest loans through the cooperatives by giving them priority.
"
5414,"The target is to invest Rs 3,863,800,000 in loans during the plan period which is more than double the amount invested in the Sixth plan.
"
5415,"For good turnover loan realisation will be made more effective. In the urban and rural areas savings collection will be mobilised development bonds will be issued commercial banks will make available finances to the Agricultural Development Bank loans and second mortgage will be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank.
"
5416,"Loan amounts to the projects under multi lateral assistance will be channeled through the Agricultural Development Bank.
"
5417,"Investment projections on different projects are presented in the Table 24.67.
"
5418,"In addition to the above loan and investment certain portion of the deposits of the commercial banks will be invested in the agriculture sector for increasing agricultural production. Insecticides
"
5419,"In the period from the time seeds and saplings of different crops are planted in the soil to the time of harvest diseases and insects destroy the crops.
"
5420,"During the Seventh Plan. insecticides being one of the items of crop protection will be provided for increasing the production and productivity in special and pocket areas specifically emphasised by the programme by protecting the crops from the attack by the diseases and insects, in other areas the main way of increasing the production is to protect the crop from diseases and insects.
"
5421,"Such insecticides will be used by activating the crop protecting servises. 124,000 litres liquid and 6,400 metric tons of power insecticides required during the Seventh plan will be made available through institutional channels.
"
5422,"Constant effort will be put to supply the insecticides through the institutional channels in the areas without transport facilities and in the areas which can be cultivated immediately.
"
5423,"In Other areas private sector will supply.
"
5424,"Agriculture Implements
"
5425,"Agriculture implements have a very important role to increase the production by saving time by making the farmer effcient.
"
5426,"Against this background, if less time is consumed in ploghinghing , harrowing, grading, threshing, processing.etc. crop turnover in thelimited land will be more resulting in increased production and employment opportunity. Emphasis will be given to manufacture simple andscientific implements required for farming and appreciated by the farmers.
"
5427,"Marketing anddistribution of Rs 17,650,000 worth ofsmall agriculture implements will be carried out during the seventh plan. Scientific agriculture implements like plough, seed drill thresher etc. which have direct impact on increasing production in the areas accorded priority by agriculture production programmes will bemarketed at concessional rates.
"
5428,"Agri-lime
"
5429,"Emphasis willbegiven to use gri-line as a part of agriculture goods inconsultation with thesoil analysis progrmme for neutralising the soil acidity which advesely effectsthe production, that is to use 21,000 metric tons of agri-line during the plan period.
"
5430,"Thesubsidy pressently give in the use of agriculture will continue.
"
5431,"Storage of Agriculture Goods
"
5432,"With the increase in the supply of agriculture goods storage facilities also have to be added andso additional godowns will be construfted in the areas which are accorded priority by theproduction programme .During the plan period godwons with the capacity of 29,000 metric tons will be added.
"
5433,"From fhis the present capacity of64,456 metric tons will be raised to 93,456 metric tons.
"
5434,"Production Services Agriculture Publicity
"
5435,"Increase in agriculture is possible only whien theproduction techniques andinputs are used properly.Improved techniques which have been developed for the proper use of production inputs have to be taken to the farmers who will be explainedhow these techniques will be amalgamated into their traditional practices how tthe newtechniques will be used.Since the re sponsibility of agriculture informationsystem is to bring awareness among the farmers for increasing agriculture production increase in earning and employment opprotunities and improvement in the standard of living of the farmers target is set in the Seventh plan to use agriculture publicity along with the production target in a composite package.
"
5436,"Agriculture in fromation programme can collect information on farming situation favoured crop necessary inputs their kind andtheir proportion ; can exchange informtion on quantity of inputs required time and place and requirement of types ofservices and can function like a contact institution with the units carry out activities on agriculture inputs agriculture credit improved seeds crop protection crop technology soil analysis etc. and hence agriculture publicity will be activated in ordewr to support inproviding production inputs andservices to the farmers at one time and well ahead of the farming season.
"
5437,"Taking into consideration of the active role of house wives or women ingriculture women's activities affairs coordinators programme at the deprtmental level will be organised for making women's participation effective.
"
5438,"District production will be established with the representation of all institutions related to agriculture development in each district for providing production inputs and services to meet the requirement of farmers in making agriculture publicity if formation effective.
"
5439,"The objective of all the institutions related to agriculture development of the district will be so framed that their common objective is to attain the agriculture production fixed for the district.
"
5440,"The secretariat of the production group will be at the district agriculture development office. reward and punishment will be related to the attainment of the target set for the district.
"
5441,"District production programme will be executed by dividing the programm into special, pocket and normal on the basis of irrigation facilities, existing as well as feasible,and production inputs and services will be provided according to the priority accorded. Are as which have no direct influcence of the programme will be put under other programmes.
"
5442,"Service centers will be organized by taking into consideration the weightage of the district production programme for their effectiveness.
"
5443,"At these centres basic infrastructures such as crop protection materials, implements, soil analysis kits, fertiliser, seeds, marketing, loan investment and technical assistance will be made available.
"
5444,"District production teams will implement the production programmes through these s ervice centers.
"
5445,"Production services in the form of a package will be provided to the farmers on the spot in the special and pocket areas through the services centres.
"
5446,"Training and supervision services will be provided to the farmers through these servic e centres by determining production blocks of 100 hectares each or accoeding to the requirement of the panchayat in a package from for which one agr4iculture assistant or panchayat level agriculture assistant will be assigned.
"
5447,"These assistants will be evaluated on the basis of improved techniques being used in their respective areas.
"
5448,"In the orchard having 25 hectares one trained agriculture assistant will be proviede.
"
5449,"Such training programmes or supervision programmes will be carried out in the farms of the farmers.
"
5450,"While training is given among the new recruits of agriculture assistants 10% of them will be women.
"
5451,"Also for travels and seminars organised for the farmers 10% participation will be given to women.
"
5452,"Since regional directorate are not effective because they have to supervise may districts with regard to monitoring and direction of district production programme, instead of this zonal level agriculture information offices will be established to monitor and direct the district production programme effectively.
"
5453,"In addition, district agriculture development offices will be strengthened technically. information and coordination, training and manpower development and planning and evaluation at the departmental level will be consolidated.
"
5454,"Agriculture extension will be made more practical by consolidating agriculture information services during ath plan period.
"
5455,"Necessary support will be given to involve rural youth programme with the training of farmers in order to expose the new generation towards improved techniques for agriculture development.
"
5456,"Important activities on agriculture publicity programme for fulfilling the production target in the Seventh Plan by the agriculture publicity services programme in brief is given below:-
"
5457,"1. To attain the set agriculture production target.
"
5458,"2. To provide production inputs and services to the farmenrs in time to attain the target set.
"
5459,"3. Inproved techniques for agriculture production will be widely publicized by exhibition of result and methods, agriculture workshop, agriculture tours and discoursed., distribution of booklets, training of farmers, radio programme, competition of production.
"
5460,"4. To organise competition of crop production from service centre level to the national level and to reward the excellent farmer and one month allowance will be given as token of encouragement additionally to the agriculture assistant on the basis of attaining the set production targer.
"
5461,"5. Production programme will be monitored and evaluated at every stage.
"
5462,"Crop Technique Service
"
5463,"Within the command area of different farms station problems will be studied on the spot at the production areas and services will be provided From these farms for solving them.
"
5464,"Necessary services will be provided according to the weightage at the program for the areas outside the catchment area of these farm stations.
"
5465,"Crop Protection Services
"
5466,"Since crop protection service has an important role it will be more effective by increasing the crops by protecting the from dieseases and insects, birds, rats, etc.
"
5467,"In addition ot the crop protection units in different form stations additional crop protection units will be established in different form Stations during the plan period. These units will be developed by equipping them with equipments, chemical including laboratory services, for these crop protection officer in the district agriculture development office and technicians in other district service centres will be deputed. Local JTA/JT, Agriculture Assistant will be trained on crop protection and theyt will be mobilised for prevention of diseasse and insects.
"
5468,"For the crop protection services for organising the central crop protection office looking after programme formulation, coordination and supervision, organsational improvement will be brought about by keeping all the employees of all groups who take part in crop protection in the field of insects and diseases.
"
5469,"Therfore, by agriculture publicity it means not only the publicity of agriculture techniques alone but all the efforts combined in a package form also in order to make the production programme successful.
"
5470,"Soil Analysis Service
"
5471,"The soil analysis service is extremely important for recommending the type and dose of fertilisers by testing, analylsis and study of the fertility power of the soil because it is the most impotant input in maintaining the nutrients of the soil and recommending the require ingredients to neutralise the unnecessary and destructive elements in the soil.
"
5472,"Since chemical fertilisers have to be importaed their use has to be done in the wisest possible manner.
"
5473,"In tis context, soil analysis services will be used in order to attain the target of agriculture porduction in an integrated manner with the agriculture production programme in making it effective during the Seventh Plan.
"
5474,"Soil analysis services will be production group in fulfilling the production target according to special , pocket and normal programme areas in order of priority.
"
5475,"Among the recommended nutrients for increasing the fertility of the soil chemical fertilisers, compost fertilisers and animal manure according to the location recommendations about Yojaula Blue, Green Algae and green manure will be made available, Recommendations for the use of zinc and agri-lime for treating the soil will be made available and use of such materials will be programmed.
"
5476,"To provide the services by making the soil analysis more effective existing soil analysis units in different places and additional units in Janakpur, Surkhet, Jumla and Doti will be strengthened.
"
5477,"Government farms and government institutions alone connot play the adequate role in the production of seed. They will be directed to be busy in predicting new Varity of improved seeds and production of high quality seeds for substituting the aged seeds.
"
5478,"Governments farms will produce foundation seed and some certified seeds and through Agricultural Inputs Corporation production of certified seeds will be increased.
"
5479,"Selected farmers will be associated in these activities by training them on techniques for determining purity, selecting highly fertile seeds, storage, etc. for associating the private sector in increasing the production and marketing and distribution of improved seeds which have been recognised.
"
5480,"Seed testing, seed crop inspection and seed certification for the farmers involved in the seed breeding programme will be carried out under the seed techniques and development services.
"
5481,"For making the seed technique and certification services effective seed testing laboratories will be added at Khairenitar, Hardinath and Dang and the existing laboratories together eight laboratories will be strengthened.
"
5482,"Are units in 7 places like Bhojpur, Kankai, Kavre, marfa, Rampur Doti and Kanchanpur will be organized.
"
5483,"Districts covered by the programme will be made self-sufficient by effective operation of these units in providing quality seed development services.
"
5484,"Thus supply of improved seeds will be made to the farmers in time thus creating the atmosphere in establishing seed processing industries by making the private sector capable in seed production and distribution.
"
5485,"Seed technique and development services will be provided through the nearest service centre in the area according to priority given by the agriculture production programmes in consulting with the district production groups.
"
5486,"Such services will be available from the above mentioned laboratories and area units as well.
"
5487,"To make the seed technique and developemnt services effcetive and consolidate the seed programme necessary improvement will be brought in the central organisational matters.
"
5488,"Activites related to high class seed committee. separate category for the employees of seed technolo0gy and development services will be properly organised under this programme.
"
5489,"Training Programme
"
5490,"Training will be very medium for increasing agriculture production by using the inputs and techniques widely by giving training on different subjects to the workers of different levels involved in agriculture development activities for the seccessful implementation of the agriculture production programme.
"
5491,"Against this background, adequate facilities could not be provided to training programmes which were scattered, because training programmes were conducted as pert of agriculture programme in the previous plans with no follw -ups, duplication of activities between the training programme and training centre. The following arrangement will be made in executing the training programme also with the production programme in the Seventh Plan:-
"
5492,"1. Duplication will be eliminated by evaluating the training programmes and training centers.
"
5493,"2. Training programmes will be effectively executed by reducing the 39 training centres to 10.
"
5494,"Realising the need of providing preservice training to the new officer recruits and periodic officer training on etraining centre will be fully equipped to give taining on all subjcets and the other training centres will be developed to provide training on subjcets according the need of the area where agriculture programme is implemented.
"
5495,"3. Syllabus and course materials will be developed by the training experts in consulation with the programme experts and speciialists.
"
5496,"The training centres will be fully equipped with physical infrastructure for making the training programme more practical supported by experimental exercises.
"
5497,"4. In farming since woment are attentive than men facilities will be increased in each training to encourage women to take part in training including construction of hostel.
"
5498,"5. Training and manpower development will be strengthened for executing training programme in a well org anized manner by assessing the requirement for different programmes. Programme will be implemented in a coordinated manner in such a way that concerned programmes will furnish the materials required for Their respective subjects such as foodgrain crops, cash crops, fruits and vegetable and fish development in carrying out training programme for different levels.
"
5499,"Agriculture Research and Technique Development
"
5500,"To increase the agriculture production according to the need of the dountry is tis extemely neces sary to use appropriat techniqies.
"
5501,"Dynamic research programme is necessary to develop improved techniques for use by the farmers according to needs. it is eextremely necessary to execute agriculture research prgramme as complimentary to agriculture publicity for developing a technique which is simple, easy to apply and matching to condition of the farmer by studying the problems cropped up while the recommended techniques are used by the farmers.
"
5502,"Agrainst this background agriculture research and technique development programme will be implemented with a clear cut direction.
"
5503,"For this research programme will be implemented in the following manner:- 1. In the sixth plan even though emphasis was given that research farms were given specified areas for research in the farm and external services in the command area but lack of clear cut direction could not make services and research works effective, and also because the research works carried were only to the interest and capacity of the researchers more than meeting the specific requirement. Organizational improvement will be brought about for giving clear cut direction in research and development during the Seventh plan.
"
5504,"2. For implementing the agriculture research and development progrtamme by activating the inactive research coordination committee in the form of national agriculture research coordination committee in the Ministry of Agriculture consisting of , National Council of Science and Technology will be set up. If this committee does not ratify no research will be carried on any problem.
"
5505,"3. Research panels will be set up to carry out the function of the secretariat of the agriculture research coordination committee in the field of agriculture animal development, animal health and socio-economic study.
"
5506,"In these panels concerned specialists will be nominated and these panels will prepare the clear cut research projcets which will solve the shor-term and long-term problems for increasing th eproduction taking into consideration the problems faced yb the farm station and as pointed out by agriculture publicity programme, and these projects Will be included in the annual programme after ratification by the national agriculture research coordination committee and the research panel will identify the person who will take the reponsiblility of executing the research project and the research will be carried out through the appropriate farm stations
"
5507,"4. Research works specified by the committee only will be carried out in the research farms and stat ions.
"
5508,"In such research activities the responsible person will not be held responsible for the services to be provided to the command area of the farm stations.
"
5509,"By deputing research assistants in the research farms for providing the external services in the command area through these assistants, research will be experimented in the farmers' fields, technical advice will be provided for crop development, results of experiments from the fields of the farmers will be communicated to farm researches and these assistants will be held responsible for the researches which are related to the farmers' fields.
"
5510,"5. The budge allocation made for the research project approved by the national agriculture research coordiantion committee will establish a clear situation for correct assessment of the investment or research and its achievement by eliminating the vaguenes of the existing investyment in the research farm station.
"
5511,"6. The existing central research unit at Khumaltar will be achivated by reoganising it in the form of national research centre and it will be developed as a source centre for the research panels in issuing direction by monitoring and evaluating all the research and technical services of al the farms and station.
"
5512,"In the main units related to relatd to researches of the national agriculture, research ecntre with subject-wise division, major crop development programme and agriculture farm and stations will be established.
"
5513,"7. To make the proposed research and technique development prgramme dynamic, existing centres will be recorganised and consolidated.
"
5514,"The activities of the research farms will be clearly spelt by classifying them into research farm, service oriented farm and service and commercial farms.
"
5515,"Agriculture Price and Market Development
"
5516,"To derive the expected results from the proposed additional investment for increasing production, the produced goods must receive proper price and market.
"
5517,"Priority will be given in the Seventh plan to give fair price and market for the agriculture goods produced for encouraging increased investment and effort for increasing the production.
"
5518,"Of the goods produced since some surplus will be available for marketing, proper price and marketing will be guaranteed for 15% of the total marketable quantity of the major agriculture product every year.
"
5519,"For issuing this guarantee the following steps will be taken: - 1 	One advisory committee will be set up consisting of experts for counselling His Majesty's Government on approved prices every year by constant study of the cost of production, comparative benefits and selling prices of the agriculture products.
"
5520,"Against the present practice of fixing price by different institutions, responsibility will be given to this committee for fixing the price of all agriculture products and toimplement this price and study its effectiveness. 2 	Fixation of approved price will be done on the basis of goods promoted by agriculture programme and high classified goods and special quality or variety goods.
"
5521,"The farmers will be informed about the approved prices of the specified crops well ahead of the farming season in order to enable them to formulate their production plan. 3 	Study programmes will be implemented in order to make the expert committee with regard to approved price on farming expenses, on crop conditions, pre -crop condition, supply of foodgrains and consumption and so on according to necessity. 4 	Arrangement will be made to fix the responsible central institution to buy the agriculture at the approved price or to buy at the market centre or depot when majority of the farmers sell their produce at the approved price fixed by the consolidation of Nepal Food corporation.
"
5522,"Special priority will be given to develop wholesale market on the weightage of the programme in the area which specifically emphasised by foodgrain production programme.
"
5523,"Wholesale market will be developed in a coordinated manner by giving priority to milk and livestock production areas receiving top priority from livestock developmetn programme, urban areas and areas near th ehighway where special programme is implemented under fruit production programme, area where potato is used as staple food and special programme area near market and having transport facilties under potatoes development programme, vegetable production project area for meeting the demand of the urban area nder vegetable production programme, on the basis of market feasibility.
"
5524,"To generate the situation for the farmers to bring their produce direct to the haat market or wholesale market production groups will be established which will be provided with the information on market and othe rtechnical services and through them agriculture produce will be brought to the market.
"
5525,"If collection centres are required forthese groups prvate sector will be encourage to set up such centres. techniques development and extension programme will be executed in special and pocket areas which have been accorded priority by the agriculture production programme with special ecphasis, Considering the contrnuous requiremnet of rural foodgrain preservation programme a separate institution will be established during the plan period to give a permanent shape to this programme. 16 	Chassification and certification services of the agriculture goods which come into the internal and external market after determining quality level will be implemented with the agriculture produce marketing programme in a composite manner.
"
5526,"Emphasis will be given to maintain quality, goodwill and reliability in the internal and external markets. 9 	Food Technology Development
"
5527,"By carrying out experimental studies on storage and processing of agriculture produce the volume of food items will be increased and for maintaining quality adulteration in the processing food will be stopped. Food research quality control and nutrition researh and development programme will be given appropriate priority in the Seventh Plan, for studing the composition of nutrients in the available food , for developing the methods of processing foodgrains, vegetable, fruits and pulses, for improving the nutritious condition of the people through publicity and promotion because such activities affect the people through publicity and promotion because such activities affect the internal and external market and price of agriculture production, for supporting collection of information on market and price and for increasing the agriculture production. under food research programme, appropriateness of the processed agriculture goods use the new and existing technology, processing activities will be developed in the private sector through publicity and promotion and training.
"
5528,"Grinding coffee seeds into powder in Gulmi, establishing processing industry, installing equipment for processing coffec seeds in Palpa and Arghakhanchi, for developing cellar stores for storing potatoes, technical services will be provided to private sector. Special emphasis will be given to establish industries in the major areas where fruits will be produced.
"
5529,"Potato development programme will produce appropriate variety of potatoes for producting potato chips, and for processing it into making powder.
"
5530,"The above mentioned programme will be implemented in the aresa which are accorded priority by agriculture production programme along with production programme in an integrated manner.
"
5531,"During the plan period the total production of major foodgrains will be 5,370,000 metric tones, Consumable quantity of this production will be 3,400,000 metric tons.
"
5532,"On the basis of the capacity of supply of production inputs and mobilisation according to the target, per capita consumption will be 174kg. Consumable production of high hills and hilly region will be 87% and 34 of the tolat production of those areas respectively.
"
5533,"By improving feasiblility condition through expansion of irrigation facilities from minor irrigation construction in the hilly region, pocket are will be developed. Provions will be made to distribute improved seeds and crop protection materials effectively, to provide the agriculture inputs and agriculture extension services to the farmens through service centre for supporting the increase of local production whereby the need for distribution of foodgrains will be gradually reduced.
"
5534,"In the high hills since there is no scope for further increase of foodgrain production, its supply has to be increased.
"
5535,"Since foodgrain is in surplus in Terai, surplus of terai and pocket areas of the Hilly region will be sold by the surplus owners.
"
5536,"Because of geographical conditions all the areas do not have adequate foodgrains and since a major portion of the Hilly Region has transport problem and because of lack of free market supply is not regular and special arrangement has to be made for supplying foodgrains.
"
5537,"The target is set to sell 53,500 metric tones of foodgrains in the frist year and 62,100 metric ton in the final year of the plan on the basis of increasing population and deficit in the hilly districts.
"
5538,"This sale will be from minimum of 15% to 20% in the high hills and in the Hilly Regon from 20% in the firs year will be reduced to 15% in the final year with hope of increasing foodgrain production.
"
5539,"To implement the programme in order to supply and moblise foodgrain for fulfilling the target the following step will be followed.
"
5540,"1. Foodgrain marketing
"
5541,"Distribution of foodgrain will be done through institutional channels in the searce remote hilly and high hill districts.
"
5542,"Districts having transport in the scarce remote hilly and high hill districts. Districts having transport facilities institutional distribution will be reduced.
"
5543,"In established areas foodgrain distribution will be undertaken by private sector. The existing practice of institutional distribution in the established areas will be gradually reduced and stopped at the end of the Seventh Plan.
"
5544,"2. foodgrain procurement
"
5545,"Foodgrain will be procured from the production areas emphasised by the agriculture programme for further distribution for which cooperative organisations will be given preference and private sector will be taken into confidence in purchasing the foodgrains from haat bazar or depots at a price not less than the approved price.
"
5546,"Thus paddy, wheat, maize, millet cumulatively weighing 62,000 metric tons of consumable quantity will be procured within the plan period.
"
5547,"For running and emergency stock 30,000 metric tons will be procured in the first year and every year stock will be renewed by corresponding new purchases.
"
5548,"Maximum quantity will be procured from the Hilly Region for easy transport to the high hills for supply in the scarce period. This way if local market is developed transport subsidy is reduced.
"
5549,"3. foodgrain Stock
"
5550,"It will be made compulsory for the private stockholders to submit the information on foodgrain stock every 2 moths for keeping upto date information on foodgrains in connection with the study of foodgrain management and market. When renewing the loan against mortagege of foodgrains prior approval from His majesty's Government which implements supply programme is essential .
"
5551,"4. Pricing
"
5552,"Foodgrain will be procured at eh approved price fixed according to agriculture price and marketing programme. marketing will be under taken by fixing the price on commertcial basis.
"
5553,"But in case price has to be reduced or common facilities like transport has to be considered His Majesty's Government will bear such differential costs.
"
5554,"5. Storage
"
5555,"Procurement of foodgrains, marketing, mobilisation, stock, godown for emergency and price stabilisation stock existing godowns will be utilised to their full capacity and new godowns will be constructed at appropriate places.
"
5556,"The esisting capacity of the godowns is 87,000 metric tons which will be raised to 172,000 metric tons by adding godowns capacity for 85,000 metric tons in the Seventh Plan
"
5557,"The target of foodgrain distribution for the programmes referred above is presented in the Table 24.69 11.
"
5558,"Agriculture Statistics and Economic Analysis
"
5559,"For formulating policy for agriculture development and agriculture programme agriculture statistics is very essential.
"
5560,"Similary for studying the cost of production of other crops basic information will be collected and analysis prepared for developing policy bases economic analysis is important.
"
5561,"To make the agriculture statistics reliable and correct and for making it impartial and independent unit should be established.
"
5562,"It this context agriculture statistics will cover maximum areas and, for making it authentic, collection, processing and analysis will be undertaken in the Seventh Plan Under agriculture statistics in addition to collection of statistics of foodgrains and cash crops regularly statistics of pulses, livestock, fruits fish, vegetables, ginger, cardamon, etc, will be collected processed and published. Techniques will be developed for collection of price date of different agriculture crops every week along the border areas.
"
5563,"The date will be publicshed. This programme will be implemented by training the employees in the use of forecasting techniques.
"
5564,"For production areas which are accorded priority by the agriculture programme collection of statistics will be done separetely and published accordingly.
"
5565,"To implement the study programme of farming expenses effectively by studying the cost of production of the crops in the area which are accorded priority by agriculture farm and agriculture programme, bases will be developed for making the investment required for agriculture programmes by identifying the unit cost of factor such as irrigation water, improved seeds, chemical fertilizer and insecticides, agriculture loan, and technical services which have important role for agriculture production.
"
5566,"No matter how effectively the plan is prepared if the implementation is not carried out in a correct way and in time, achievement will not only lag behind the target but the overruns will necessitate additional investment of fulfil the same target and this failure to fulfil the target will adversely affect national product and the overall economy.
"
5567,"To fill in the gap between the plan and implementaion of the previous plans with regard to development programmes, effective implementation, follow-up and review and evaluation are a must.
"
5568,"Ecrn thourtyh the project or programme is attractive but if the implementation is not carried out correctly, the plan becomes meaningless and so for correct implementation in the Seventh Plan constant monitoring will be carried out from the stage of plan formulation to execution of all activities and to establish the practic of review and evaluation of projects and programme will be implemented clearly in the following manner: - A.
"
5569,"Objective of the programme 	: What to do, why to do, for what purpose it is to be done ?
"
5570,"Working policy 	How to do, what method to be followed?
"
5571,"C. Detailed work plan 	Where, When, How Who, How much to do ?
"
5572,"D. Constant monitoring and evaluation 	What happened, How much completed, How the work was done and Where? what sort of influence it had?
"
5573,"With regard to question related to A,B,C the Seventh Plan has been formulated with due consideration to these questions.
"
5574,"Where, when, who How much are valid every year and so will be taken note of, while proparing the annual programmes.
"
5575,"Agriculture developeent project and programme thus implemented will be related to D or the fourth aspect.
"
5576,"Constant monitoring, evaluation and review will be an insparable part of the project and programme.
"
5577,"Some portion of investment allotted for the project will set asid for this programme from the projcet level to ministry level of agriculture programme. This programme will be implemented in consultation with the National Planning Commission.
"
5578,"Thus district production group of service centre level and zonal agriculture publicity office of district level will carry out the monitoring and evaluation.
"
5579,"At the central level, division (on related subject) in the department or ministry will carry out the monitoring and evaluation.
"
5580,"At the national level National Palnning Commission will conduct the monitoring and evaluation in consultaion with the concerned ministry.
"
5581,"On the basis of success or failure exhibited by monitoring and evaluation of programmes, practice of reward and punishment of the responsible person(s) need to be effectively implemented.
"
5582,"This practice will be strictly followed in the Seventh Plan, in the following manner:- 1.
"
5583,"In each district under the supervision to the proposed agriculture production team through the service Centre, competition of crops, livestock, fish etc. will be organised and efficient farmers will be rewarded. Agriculture workers will be rewarded Rs 200.00 for attaining the target.
"
5584,"Appropriate reward will be given to the JT/JTA who attain their respective targets.
"
5585,"2. If the set target of the district is fulfilled, district panchayat will be specifically honoured or additional subsidy will be given to this panchayat.
"
5586,"If the district production team fulfils the production target medal, or training in a foreign country, or appropriate reward will be given, similarly, at the zonal level fulfillment of the zonal production target and at the ministerial level fulfillment of the national production target will be appropriately rewarded.
"
5587,"3. Execution of programme and fulfilling the target is possible through joint efforts and, if necessary support is not forthcoming from the respective units or institutions, fitting punishment will be given.
"
5588,"4. To implement the system of reward and punishment, the production target of each service center and production block has to be fixed. This should be done every year on the basis of directives received by the district agriculture coordination committee.
"
5589,"5. To attain the production target of the district, joint participantion of farmers, local panchayats, and agriculture workers will be encouraged, and from the stage of formulation of plan to monitoring, review and evaluation local panchayat will be associated.
"
5590,"Since agriculture development programme seeks to enlist massive participation of farmers, all production targets according to decerntralisation are included under district level programme.
"
5591,"As mentioned in the sub-heading above on order to attain the target of agriculture production programme all feasible production are have to be brought to use.
"
5592,"For attaining such production target production group should mobilize inputs and services like agriculture extension, agriculture credit, improved seed, fingerling, chemical fertilisers, improved livestock, veterinery service, production e3quipment, etc. through service centers in the area which are accorded priority by the programme.
"
5593,"District production teams will be established consisting of representative of all institutions concerned with agriculture development and these teams will have to coordinate with the district agriculture coordination committee for implementing agriculture programme
"
5594,"Therefore, to fulfil the agriculture production target fixed by the Seventh Plan, areas will be specified in the districts and programme will be implemented accordingly, District production teams will prepare the programme, get it approved from the district, implement it and will undertake follow up and evaluation.
"
5595,"On the basis of programmes mentioned in the sub-headings for fulfilling the production target proposed, main programmes at district level and budget are presented below.
"
5596,"This budget is included in the overall budget presented above.

5598,"IRRIGATION METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
"
5599,"Introduction
"
5600,"Predominance of agricultural sector can contribute highly significant role to increase national output of the country. In the seventh plan the prime importance of priority has been given to the agricultural sector to fulfill the target of an intensive production at high rate.
"
5601,"In this respect there are abundant possibilities to have the intention of accentuation the agricultural production. Agricultural productions are estimated to increase abundantly at highly rate if irrigation facilities are fulfilled, although endowed and enriched with water resources we are still unable to utilize appropriate irrigation facilities systematically because of manifold reasons. 13 percent of irrigation facilities had been fulfilled in the agricultural land by the end of the sixth plan.
"
5602,"Because of insufficient irrigation facilities, agriculture should wholly depend upon uncertain monsoon, no doubt.
"
5603,"From these view points several efforts had been attained to the earlier plan periods..
"
5604,"The achievement of the progress is highly low as compared to its targets because of lack of financial resources and scarcity of effective achievements in the working capacity.
"
5605,"In order to extend and increase the agricultural output in the terai region to fulfill the necessary foodstuffs in the mountain regions to extend exports to collect foreign exchanges to build mountain regions as a self sufficiency for the foodstuffs and to make sound economic condition to the country at the same time the provisions of irrigation should be facilitated to the agriculture enormously as prime media during the seventh plan.
"
5606,"Hence considering the past experiences at the outset the high priority should be given to the achievements of the progress as compared with the main targets on the one hand and an additional irrigational facilities should be attained to the cultivable land involving with the proper utilisation of available water resources on the another hand.
"
5607,"Progress Evaluation of the Sixth plan
"
5608,"During the Fifth plan period the provisions of irrigation facilities for 1,98,481 hectares of land were assumed to be fulfilled.
"
5609,"Of this 1,80,926 and 17,555 hectares of land were provided with irrigation facilities in the Terai and Mountain regions respectively.
"
5610,"The main target of the Sixth plan was to provide an additional irrigational facilities to 2,33,482 hectares of land but an area of 18,000 hectares could not operate under construction because of the lack of financial resources and some projects in agreement with foreign aid only by name but not in action.
"
5611,"Some other working efficiency of irrigational projects become unable to initiate in time and could not meet the target because of manifold resons.
"
5612,"By this way during the sixth plan period an additional 52,503 hectares of land were provided irrigational facilities for the first four years and an additionl 41,630 hectares of land were porvided for the Fifth year. Hence an additional 94,133 hectares of land were estimated to be irrigated during the sixth plan period.
"
5613,"Futhermore 17137 hectares of land were provided an irrigational facilities for the first four years which had been completed by agriculture Ministry with the digging tube well boring projects and an additional 3,572 hectares of land were provided an irrigational facilities by Panchayat and locl Development Ministry at the same time and at the end of the Sixth Plan 24,457 and 8,32 hectares of land were estimated to provide an additional irrigational facilities respectively.
"
5614,"Hence the grand total of 73,212 hectares of land had been provided an additional irrigational facilities for the first four year of the sixth plan and 66,979 hectares of land were estimated in the fifth year.
"
5615,"During the sixth plan the grand total 1,40,191 hectares of land were provided with irrigational facilities by the end of the sixth plan.
"
5616,"There are envisaged some basic initiatives to be launched in the summer crop season drawn up to extend irrigational facilities to most of the farm lands that are irrigable to keep up the working efficiency of irrigation projects not only those initiatives but special attention will be given to proper maintenance and repair to use the full capacities of irrigation in operation to improve present, arrangement and distribution system of the irrigation, facilities construction canals to agrarian lands to give appropriate methods to utilizing, irrigational facilities to the consumed farmers to coordinate the water distribution among farmers and to pay head the social and economic conditions of the agriculturists so the available potential capacity of the irrigational facilities will be extended by only 42 percent in a planned and systematic way.
"
5617,"Problems and constraints During the Sixth plan periodic Implementation
"
5618,"During the Sixth plan. There were several problems and constraints which had hindered the progress of projects under construction Some of the major bottlenecks are listed below.
"
5619,"1. Several irrigation projects could not progress to fulfil the target because of financial problems as late release of funds by His Majesty's Government . Funds release for projects are often far less than the requested amount leading to two or three years delay in scheduled project work due to financial stringency which make constraints to its constructive works.
"
5620,"2. Because of the lack of foreign assistance some projects which were initiated under foreign and had to work on limited budget with long duration.
"
5621,"3. Absence of uniformity in analysing of working rates done by different sectors the basis of contract is on the least rate because of this the contractors are unable to work out qualitatively or loose the contract in the middle or delay if the new contract is called it takes long time.
"
5622,"4. At the outset absence of detailed survey and specific design estimate for the on -going projects was a handicap.
"
5623,"From this while under construction it makes delay in working efficiency and it takes long time for completion.
"
5624,"5. At the outset because of lack of geological survey in the hilly areas projects are stopped due to geographical extremities in the middle while under operation it leads to the extension of time. Recommendations for the Constraints of the Sixth plan
"
5625,"There are some major conscious recommendations and reforms of the problems of the Sixth plan which are enlisted below for the implementation of the seventh plan.
"
5626,"1. To keep in operation of the target of the projects if the financial resources are already allocated.
"
5627,"2. To specify the rate analysis of the operation of the on-going projects and implement them indifferent sectors.
"
5628,"3. To prepare and ensure the basic norms by specifying the feasibility studies of the projects and implement them.
"
5629,"Objectives policies and programmes of the seventh plan Backgrounds
"
5630,"Irrigational development is indispensable for the agricultural development.
"
5631,"The progress achievement undertaken by the irrigational facilities had never been satisfactory and fulfilled to the target attained to the different earlier plan periods.
"
5632,"Because of these agriculture sector still depends on uncertain monsoon while paying specific attention to this situat ion if the target of the Seventh plan should be estimated which is to be practically completed then only the appropriate plans and programmes will be implemented to enhance the fulfillment of abundant agricultural production.
"
5633,"Food deficit problems in hilly areas can not be solved immediately though the foods are transported from the terai to hilly areas.
"
5634,"In the mountain regions special programmes will be put into effect to step up the production and productivity of food crops and the on-going projects should be completed and special attention should be given to enhance appropriate plans for the renovation and reforms of the irrigational systems.
"
5635,"Irrigations development should provide the encouragement of the private sector for the development of the country utilising the private canals at the maximum rate.
"
5636,"The utilisation of the irrigation facilities can contribute the significant increases in the agricultural productivity scientifically consisting of agricultural inputs and pesticides.
"
5637,"It enhances to increase abundant agricultural production per hectares at higher rate. From these viewpoints irrigation projects to be launched in the terai will be completed as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary delay in selecting agricultural development programme to implement new projects in the endowment of water resources place to the canals handled by the farmers to assist short term irrigation projects and to emphasis the ground water irrigation projects wherein the surface projects cannot initiate the achievement.
"
5638,"Monsoon oriented agriculture system should have reliable whether forecasting for the present moments on the scientific basis for encouraging the seasonal productions. Special attention should be given to develop infrastructures in the field of Hydrology and Meteorology for the specific utilisation of water resources.
"
5639,"Objective :
"
5640,"The basic objectives of the seventh plan have been stated in the document of irrigational development programmes outlining the basic principles of the seventh plan (1985-1990) a s follows.
"
5641,"1. As irrigation plays the vital role in extensive agriculture the certainty and permanency should be given to the uncertain agriculture which depends only on monsoon (rainfall) and then only the target of the agricultural production will be fulfilled by using the surfacial and ground water resources in the from of Natural ones.
"
5642,"1. There should be the provision of enormous irrigation facilities in the major part of the agricultural land aiming to finish within a short duration and implementing the irrigational programme at low cost.
"
5643,"2. Stress will be given to increase the working efficiency by utilising the capacity of on-going irrigation projects and present water distribution system and develop the reforms in the management of the project in a systematic way.
"
5644,"4. Special emphasis will be placed on the small irrigation projects utilising the water of river and regulate implementing the locally available skill, resources and labour in the mountain regions.
"
5645,"5. Reservoirs irrigation projects will be constructed on the large scale to collect the water during the monsoon and make it available in dry seasons.
"
5646,"3. Mountain regions oriented irrigation projects.
"
5647,"4. Large scale (long term) projects.
"
5648,"Target of the Seventh Plan
"
5649,"Additional irrigational facilities will be provided to an area of 2,35,493 hectares during the Seventh Plan period. of this 1,35,493 hectares of land will be accounted by Ministry of Water Resources and an reea of 1,00,000 hectares (50,000 hectares tube wells and 50,000 hectares small irrigation) by Ministry of Agriculture.

"
5718,"This programme during the Seventh Plan constructing t6he barrage to control and prevent the danger created by extensive river flood to the arable and.
"
5719,"This project will enhance the implementation of the programme of river control wherein it was severely indispensable emphasizing the local participation.
"
5720,"In each and every developmental zones, river control programme will be implemented as a special project.
"
5721,"(3) 	Supervision, Maintenance and Reconstruction of Completed projects
"
5722,"This programme has been initiated to extend intensive production and to utilise maximum resources by supervising the maintenance and reconstruction of the completed projects continuously.
"
5723,"This programme will continue in the Seventh Plan and will handover to the local panchayat through the working consumption committee to increase efficiency of technicians in the district level.
"
5724,"This project was initiated in 1965 for the specific and authentic data of Meteorology and forecasting services to the farmers in a scientific manner.
"
5725,"During the Seventh Plan this continuous programme will enhance to establish 5 Weather controlling centres, establishment of 20 Climatologist, 5 Aerosynauptid centres, establishment of 2 pilot balloon centres, and publishment of weekly bulletins of climatologically records of (5) 	Hydrology

G. 	District Level Programmes under Decentralisation Plan
"
5729,"During the Seventh Plan, Special emphasis will be given to implement the district level programmes under decfentralisation plan on irrigation sector, the district level programme will consist of those project which will affect or cover the only one district and should not be handled by development committees. Special attention will be given to mass local participation for the implementation of handling the selection of working programmes on district level.
"
5730,"At the outset, under the district level plan this type of programme may enhance to complete on going projects, to specify the project handled by the local services and to initiate new projects with low cost in order to irrigate enormously of an area of 15,000 hectares in the terai region, and 45,000 hectares in the mountain regions respectively.
"
5731,"Special efforts should arrange to irrigate enormously at low cost investment on projects. The proper management of irrigation should be indispensable for utilisation, supervision, maintenance and reconstruction of the completed projects.
"
5732,"After completion of the project, the benefits will directly be available to local panchaysts and the provisions for supervision, control, r4econstruction and maintenance of the projects should be made by local panchayat itself. This type of programme will create the local participation to express the encouragement of the mental sensitive for the conservation of the project.
"
5733,"Estimations of Expenses
"
5734,"The estimation of capabilities of allocation of expenses of and additional irrigational facilities can e presented as following.
"
5735,"LAND REFORM, COOPERATIVE AND SURVEY PROGRAMME
"
5736,"A. Land Reform
"
5737,"Land reform programme has its own importance in institutional development for increasing agriculture production.
"
5738,"It is necessary to move ahead with the land reform programme in the Seventh Plan in order to develop atmosphere for bringing maximum increase in production by effecting appropriate improvements in land ownership and utilization pattern.
"
5739,"Progress of the Sixth Plan
"
5740,"There has been no progress in fulfilling the target of organisation system and reorganisation of the manpower under the land reform department for the implementation of land reform programme as a special programme in the areas where the integrated agriculture programme is under implementation.
"
5741,"Under the regular activities tenancy right is being protected, determination of land tax has been completed in twelve districts in the first four years of the Sixth plan, land tax has been fixed in the whole of the terai region and necessary legal arrangements have been completed for scrutinising the land beyond the exemption limit.
"
5742,"The main problem is the delay in preparing the legal basis for carrying out the targeted works inland reform effectively.
"
5743,"But it has not been possible to increase the agricultural production nor agriculture business has taken the commercial from in spite of those programmes.
"
5744,"The number of tenants is small as compared to the large number of land owners but there has been no progress in making institutional arrangements for making maximum utilization of their land.
"
5745,"If it is necessary to accelerate the practice of deciding on protecting the existing and would-be tenants, determining the land tax for them, introducting the system of the tenants getting loan against their tenancy certificate, securing the loan by auctioning those certificates in case of their default, determining the excess land, making gradual termination of dual-ownership of land effective and to get rid of the legal obstacles on the one hand, it has been found extremely necessary to take steps in creating suitable atmosphere for investment on commercial farming for encouraging majority of the land owners for maximum use of their land.
"
5746,"Programme 1 	Complete the work of keeping the list of the missing old tenants and the new tenants up-to date in 21 districts of the terai where the number of tenants is more, 4 districts of the inner-terai and in the hilly districts where the survey is complete.
"
5747,"Complete the works related to sales and distribution of excess land and where new survey is complete sell and distribute the excess land found thereby completely in all respect. 2 	With the intention of giving a major share of the produce of the land to the tiller and increasing their investment for increasing production rent fixation will be completed by surveying the hilly districts by giving them priority where the number of tillers appear to be large in addition to the 27 districts where rent is determined according to the fixed rent policy.
"
5748,"Similarly, surveys will be conducted about the process of capital investment in the appropriate land units and land with and without tenancy rights; bases for institutional development will be created for increasing the agriculture production. 3 	In this context that while observing the pattern of investment for agriculture production is not effective the policy will be to encourage the agriculture system of farming on contract and promissory basis in the Seventh Plan for increasing the production by proper use of agriculture land in spite of the fact that the composition of land-ownership is more than two -thirds tillers are land owners as well.
"
5749,"Arrangements will be made that land owners will be allowed to give the land on contract or on rent for a specific period for commercial farming.
"
5750,"Encouragement will be given to those who will cultivate on contract for a specific period by exempting the income tax.
"
5751,"Such contracts can be entered into by organisation or individuals. 4 	All over due loans will be realised completely within the Seventh Plan and amounts thus collected will be handed over to cooperative organisations through agriculture Development Bank. 5 	Atmosphere will be created to associate farmers in maximum number for increasing production by enabling them to take loan against the tenancy certificate when they have to take loan for various inputs for participating in the agriculture production programme. 6 	The proposed leg al base for terminating the dual-ownership of land gradually will be experimented in certain regions.
"
5752,"Experience gained from such experiments in finding out way and means will be implemented on a wider scale. 7 	If the farmers who are willing to develop land by making blocks have no money for exchanging suitable land or procure land, finance will be made available to them from agricultural development Bank or other institutions for effecting the system of making blocks and, for the consolidation of land, works related to this will be started and registration fee will be exempted for exchange of land.
"
5753,"B Comparatives Development
"
5754,"Cooperatives development programme becomes important for bringing improvement in the economic condition of the people by associating them in the development activities through the medium of cooperatives and by gathering together the scattered manpower and small capital.
"
5755,"It is very essential to carry forward the cooperative programme in order to make it effective from the bottom level in the Seventh Plan.
"
5756,"Progress of the Sixth Plan
"
5757,"Reorganise the cooperative organisations by conducting feasibility studies for improving the qualitative condition of the existing cooperative organisations under comparing programme and consolidation programme small farmer cooperative organisation under integrated progarmme for development of cooperatives. 32 small farmers cooperatives and 37 cooperative organisations were established.
"
5758,"To fulfil the objective of training cooperative workers, constructing necessary godowns and to run the cooperatives organisations effectively, 9 cooperative godowns were constructed, 742 cooperative organisations were established and or reorganised by the end of the Fifth Plan and 724 cooperative organisations survived by the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan.
"
5759,"The members of the cooperative organisations at the end of the Fifth Plan which was, 1,193,765 went up to 1,399,121 at the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan.
"
5760,"Rs 38,300,000 worthy of agriculture produce is expected to be sold in the Sixth Plan period.
"
5761,"Expected progress has not ben possible while scrutinising capacity of the cooperative organisations in playing important role in the rural areas and in improving the rural economics for agriculture development.
"
5762,"Weakness in the management of cooperative organisation, problem of operating capital because of ineffective realisation of capital effecting the capital flow, influential members taking benefits from the cooperative movement, small and less influential members unable to take advantages are the major problems.
"
5763,"Background of Seventh Plan
"
5764,"Cooperative development programme is to be implemented with the aim of developing cooperative movement as the main axis of village economy by generating appropriate environment for a large number of farmers increasing production through the medium of cooperative in the Seventh Plan by giing emphasis on marketing of agriculture implements required for the farmer, processing of agriculture produces and their marketing in the activities for increasing agriculture production.
"
5765,"Appropriate atmosphere will be created for strengthening cooperatives at the rural level, for support to increase the welfare and facilities of cooperative organisations, manage the central office of the cooperative organisations and it has been essential to offer membership to the farmer group of small farmer development projects and other areas in order to develop them in the form of pre-cooperatives.
"
5766,"Objectives 1 	To look after the welfare of the small and marginal farmers through the medium of cooperatives by organising them. 2 	Necessary basic facilities required for agriculture development will be made available in an organised manner on the basis of local leadership and people's participation.
"
5767,"3. Develop institutional channels at the rural levels with the aim of providing direct benefit to the small farmers and other professional in addition to increasing their production and productivity.
"
5768,"Against this background for the institutional development of the cooperative movement various classes such as farmers, small farmers, labourers craftsman, skilled hands gather together in their leisure with a specific objective that their cooperation can create opportunities for increasing earnings and employment and programmes should be implemented in creating a feeling among them to this effect.
"
5769,"Hence, for strengthening the cooperative programme from the bottom level the following programme will be implemented:-
"
5770,"a. Strengthening Cooperative organisations
"
5771,"i) 	While establishing cooperative organisations nine areas in a district will be considered and programme will be given priority on the basis of feasibility studies in the districts where there is no cooperatives. Rules and bi-laws will be formulated for people's participation and increasing people's leadership for running the cooperative organisations.
"
5772,"ii) 	The existing cooperative organisations in the rural areas will be strengthened by on reorganization and consolidation for their operation for providing services along with the services centres in special and pocket regions where agriculture programme is emphasised. iii) 	Publicity and promotion programme will be implemented for increasing membership of the cooperative organisations.
"
5773,"Membership of self-made members, because of handing over of savings, will be saleable. iv) 	In the districts where small farmers development projects are implemented, once completed, these will be converted into cooperative organisations or necessary service oriented programmes will be implemented by giving membership to the existing cooperative groups.
"
5774,"Legal provisions will be made in case of offering the membership of the cooperative organisations to the small farmer groups when necessary. v) 	In the areas where small farmers development project has no influence, small and marginal farmers groups will be guided to organise themselves for the economic activities for creating earning and employment opportunities by giving them loans.
"
5775,"Not only small farmers but other farmers also will be organised into such groups, Pre-cooperative group (s) into cooperative organisations by encouraging them to be engaged in economic activities. vi) 	To solve the problem of shortage of operating capital effective steps will be taken to develop legal bases to have automatic loan realisation.
"
5776,"vii) 	Additional loan facilities will be increased by conducting proper studies on godown facilities in agriculture production programme regions and transaction of consumable goods for increasing the transaction of cooperative organisation. viii) 	Thus the target of the proposed service oriented programme through the cooperative organisation will be as follows:
"
5777,"a. To disburse Rs 435,000,000 agriculture production loans to the farmers who are members.
"
5778,"b. To distribute Rs 620,000,000 worth of agriculture inputs.
"
5779,"c. 	To market Rs 237,500,000 worth of essential consumer goods. d. 	To develop the capacity of purchasing 30,000 metric tons and marketing 126,000 metic tons of paddy, wheat, mustard, etc. by the end of the plan period.
"
5780,"e. 	To increase the number of cooperative members and investment remarkably. f. 	To attain self-sufficiency by bringing remarkable improvement in the management of cooperative organisat ion.
"
5781,"g. 	During the plan period two cooperative organisation in each development region as an example of self-sufficient institutions will be established according to the cooperative policy.
"
5782,"b. 	Speciallised cooperative organisations
"
5783,"The following programme will be implemented in order to associate the cooperative organisations not onlywith the programme of increasing agriculture production but with the mobilisation of rural savings and other activities which increase earnings:-
"
5784,"i) 	Arrangement will be made to make available rural saving banking services through cooperatives with the coordination of the Nepal Rastra Bank in encouraging the rural people to develop the habit of saving and in investing capital, generated out of the savings mobilisation, in the productive activities in the feasible regions.
"
5785,"ii) 	Different processing programmes will be implemented by establishing specialised cooperative organisations on the basis of feasibility for rice milling, oil mills, milk collection and processing, cardamom processing, ginger processing, etc. for encouraging organisations will be associated with foodgrain processing and oil mills, five cooperative organisations will be established for milk collection and processing and two each for cardamom and ginger processing.
"
5786,"iii) 	Activities will be carried out for farmers residing in the rural areas and other skilled craftsmen running cottage and small scale industries in their leisure time from farming through cooperatives in the form of one existing cooperative organisations or separate six women cottage industries cooperative programme on the basis of feasibility or by establishing and association.
"
5787,"Necessary coordination will be maintained for management, supply of raw materials and marketing of produced goods in consolation with the Women's Service Coordination committee.
"
5788,"Training programme will be conducted for development of skilled and trained manpower for implementing cooperative programmes, for increasing awareness amo ng cooperative members on the concepts of cooperative movement, for developing the feeling that cooperative organisations will be established according to the needs of the people and they themselves will run the cooperatives for their own benefit.
"
5789,"It has been necessary to carry out various activities such as measuring the land in a scientific manner, finding out the exact area of land, supporting the determination of survey policy and its implementation, preparing maps in different scales within the country for different purposes and producing necessary manpower for survey programmes effectively in the Seventh Plan.
"
5790,"Progress of the Sixth Plan
"
5791,"With regards to survey programme specifically in the Plan, survey of nine districts was in progress, that of 5 districts completed and 504,160 hectares wer4e demarcated against the target of continuing survey works in 16 districts, to complete surveys in 12 districts and demarcate 515,260 hectares.
"
5792,"The main reason for the survey to continue and to be completed in small number of districts is that the actual area is more than the estimated area in some districts.
"
5793,"Against the target of inking 37,500 data cards and establishing 37,500 ting points only 34,099 and 35,557 respectively were accomplished.
"
5794,"Against the target of preparing 970 sheet6s of maps in different scales 1,048 sheets of maps were prepared.
"
5795,"Against the t6arget of training 951 trainees 55I trainees were trained.
"
5796,"Since all the trainees have not been employed the number had to be reduced.
"
5797,"Background of Seventh Plan
"
5798,"It is extremely necessary to complete survey of all the districts of the country for correct statistics on land re4quired for different development programmes in steering the activities to wares a definite direction.
"
5799,"In this context the objective of the survey programme in the Seventh Plan is presented below.
"
5800,"Objectives
"
5801,"1. Emphasis will be given to complete the survey programme for determining the correct area of land and other statistics.
"
5802,"2. To prepare maps of different scales required for implementing administrative, social and economic development projects.
"
5803,"3. To establish control points and bench marks required for all types of survey works scientifically.
"
5804,"4. To be self -sufficient in manpower required for preparing different types of maps within the country.
"
5805,"In addition to this, special programme will be implemented to survey the urban areas and rural blocks.
"
5806,"The targets set for the plot demarcation survey and programmes are given below: Districts where plot demarcations survey will be completed: During the Seventh Plan survey will be completed in 65 districts and will continue in 5 districts.
"
5807,"b. 	Geodetic Survey
"
5808,"The geodetic survey has and important role in assisting establishment of control points, determination of altitudes, determination of location of stars, planets and direction, identification of the exact situation of control points required for preparing necessary maps for plot demarcation and land surveys.
"
5809,"In the Seventh Plan the target is fixed for establishment of 35,000 ting points, inking 35,000 data cares, level 1,500 km., star survey of 1,000 groups, su rvey of 50 places for first class ting point and establishment of 100 points for magnetic survey. c. 	Topographic Survey
"
5810,"Topographic survey has an important role to play in the preparation of maps of different scales and in attaining self sufficiency in map preparation required for different development projects and administrative works.
"
5811,"In the Seventh Plan programmes will be implemented to prepare 125 sheets of medium scale maps, 101 sheets of small scale maps (maps for administrative, tourism and other activities), to prepare atlas, update 50 sheets of topographic maps of hilly region in scale of 1 inch equal to 1 mile, to survey 150,000 hectares for preparing large scale topographic map, to prepare 160 sheets of land resources map and to update them, to prepare school atlas, etc.
"
5812,"The target is to attain self-sufficiency by producing technicians for survey in the country within the Seventh Plan.
"
5813,"In this period, the target is to train 125 Amins, 250 junior trainees, 75 senior trainees, 30 persons in cartographic course, 25 persons in special photogramatic course, 20 persons in special map reproduction and 40 persons in computer course.
"
5814,", VEGETATION, LAND PROTECTION AND WILD-LIFE PRESERVATION AND REHABILITATION
"
5815,", being one of the most important national resources, has been supplying fuel, timber, fodder for animals, etc. is a well-known fact.
"
5816,"But, since last few years this resource has been dwindling very fast.
"
5817,"As a result essential goods like fuel, timber, etc, are not meeting the needs of the growing population.
"
5818,"In the previous plans afforestation was very low as compared to deforestation and the pace of dwindling of forest appears to be such that in the next two decades there will be no forest left worth mentioning.
"
5819,"Imple mentation of forest development programme is a big challenge for supplying the essential goods like fuel, timber, etc. and to maintain the natural balance.
"
5820,"It has been imperative to increase the forest area by large-scale afforestation in addition to preservation, promotion and use of the existing forests through the scientific management of forest as a renewable resource.
"
5821,"The situation calls for motivating the general public to take part in afforestation in a big way since an important activity like afforestation cannot be undertaken only at the government level.
"
5822,"Progress of the Sixth Plan
"
5823,"By giving top most importance to meeting the internal need of the forest products for the general public, topmost priority will be given to supply the required forest products. Fertility of the soil in the Hilly Region in particular will be protected by adopting ways and means to stop the natural calamities like landslide, floods, land- erosion and stop the rivers and rivulets from drying up and economic advantages derived by exporting - the herbs in semi -processed forms. These were the objectives of the Sixth Plan.
"
5824,"The estimate is that in the Sixth Plan 11,680,000 saplings were planted in 37,000 hectares and 14,713 kill of forest fencing completed under forest development programme.
"
5825,"Thus the progress of afforestation and forest fencing are 87% and 77% of the physical target respectively.
"
5826,"Towards distribution of saplings the progress exceeded the physical target. The reason for excessive distribution of sapling is that progress of the special economic programme of FY 1982/83 has been included.
"
5827,"Though the progress is 87 % in average in afforestation programme it could not fulfil 23 % of the set target in the panchayat forest.
"
5828,"In totality though the progress against the target appear to be satisfying or encouraging but against the prevailing problems the progress has to be considered normal.
"
5829,"For programmes were not formulated and implemented in accordance with the need and the gap between the demand and supply was wider and wider.
"
5830,"With regard to land and watershed protection it is estimated that 167gullies were controlled and 280 hectares of terraces were improved.
"
5831,"But, against the target set in the plan the programme itself was too small to tackle the prevailing problem of the country though the progress appears too attractive and hence there is no room for complacency because land erosion and situational problems have been ever magnifying.
"
5832,"Towards botanical development the target was fixed to use different herbs according to the demand of time and to carry out scientific research on herbs which have been in use profitably according to Ayurvedic methods and traditional practices and to develop technology for them.
"
5833,"In the first four years of the Sixth Plan different research activities were carried out on botanical development but no progress was recorded as to handling over of the developed technology to the concerned units.
"
5834,"Under medicine management and development programme to introduce scientific and institution supervision and controlling system on the activities such as production of medicines, export, import, service, research, storage and marketing and publicity and promotion not only physical, administrative, legal infrastructures, and manpower were developed but regulations related to registration of medicines were also put into effect.
"
5835,"The progress of methodology of determining quality of medicines, and evaluation, analysis and testing .of such methodologies, and formulation of policies and rules on medicines appears satisfactory.
"
5836,"About national parks and wild life preservation, construction and renovation of different infrastructures in he existing sanctuaries and improvement activities are completed as per the target.
"
5837,"On top of it wild life sanctuary in Bara hunting preserve at Dhorpatan and national parks at Dolpa and Khaptad are established.
"
5838,"Under forest products development programme, Sagarmatha Forest Development Project and Ratuwamai Affrostation Project have fulfilled the set target.
"
5839,"With respect of rosin and turpentine industry only, preliminary works were completed against the target of completing the construction works of the factory within the plan period.
"
5840,"Except sera and vaccines production of all necessary medicines is estimated to attain 100% of the target.
"
5841,"In FY 1981/82 a company for producing and processing of herbs was established and construction works was started and production and processing works are proceeding according to the set target. Cultivable land will be cultivated for contributing to production through the channels of rehabilitation programme.
"
5842,"People who migrate from the hilly areas to the terai and settle clearing the forests in an unorganised manner will be settled in a planned way and tendency of migration to the terai from hilly areas will be reduced and the target was fixed for rehabilitating through resettlement programme appropriately on economic considerations.
"
5843,"Of the target of the Sixth Plan to settle 25,630 families in 30,185 hectares, 27,102 families were settled in 17,900 hectares.
"
5844,"While preparing the Sixth Plan, the objective was set for increasing agricultural production by cultivating more land by settling more people. But as the environmental balance and preservation of the remaining are adversely affected from the settlement activities by clear felling of forests, His Majesty's Government has taken the policy of not carrying out the resettlement programme by clear felling of forests.
"
5845,"Background of the Seventh Plan
"
5846,"Forests which was the main source of income till a few decades back has dwindled to such an extent that it has become very critical.
"
5847,"If on the one hand it is clear that forest products required for the increasing population, cattle and industries are dropping every day not only the situational, balance has been disturbed because of destruction of ecology on the hills, mountains, river banks, farms, etc. but also spoilage of agricultural products has been quite clear.
"
5848,"Around 1963, 64,000 sq. km. or 45 % of the total land of the country was covered with forests but in 1978 or just after 15 years it has gone down to 43,000 sq.km. or 30% of the land area.
"
5849,"Thus in a period of 15 years forest resources has dwindled by about thirty three percent. While looking at the pace of destruction of forest in the terai and hills in the last 15 years 4,600 sq.km. of forest land in the hills has gone down to 3,900 sq.km and 1,800 sq.km. in terai to 400 sq.km.
"
5850,"During that period forest in the hills dwindled by 15 % and in the terai by about 78 %.
"
5851,"Even though 50 to 55 thousands sq.km. of forest area has been shown in the country according to the preliminary estimate of Land Resources Mapping Project initiated in the Sixth Plan how much forest wealth exists and how much can be utilised on the basis of management system remain questionable.
"
5852,"Among the prominent reasons for the fast dwindling of forest, fire wood, one of the most essential commodities of the daily life, is the one single factor.
"
5853,"As a result, it is clear that the forest is dwindling every year at a faster rate because firewood production on the sustained yield basis has not been able to meet the demand.
"
5854,"This gap between the demand and supply is obviously the main cause of the annual forest destruction, which is estimated to be 1000 sq.km.
"
5855,"(or more than 100,000 hectares) for firewood alone one study on the subject points out that for regular supply of firewood only in the next fifteen years 1,200000 hectares of good sal forest is necessary.
"
5856,"To prepare a good sal forest of 1,200,000 hectare afforestation should take place in about 200,000 hectares in the Seventh Plan.
"
5857,"In the Fifth and Sixth Plan or in a period of 1O years though it was estimated that afforestation could take place in 47,000 hectares it could not be more than 20 to 25 thousand hectare of forest for firewood production with the selection of afforestation area and introduction of scientific management system.
"
5858,"Therefore to have 200,000 hectares of land in five years for firewood only afforestation in 175,000 hectare is a must.
"
5859,"With the annual increase of c_tt1e, industries, domestic use, etc. the demand for forest products has been increasing every day.
"
5860,"The way the price of firewood is increasing illustrates that supply of firewood is far too short of demand.
"
5861,"In spite of difficulties in collecting statistics on the demand and supply of firewood it has been extremely necessary to increase the forest area for firewood production.
"
5862,"According to the opinion of the experts, 43 % of the land area of the country should be covered by good forest in order to maintain the greenery in the country and improve the situational balance.
"
5863,"But, in the present circumstance, more than 1 lakh (100,000) hectares of forest area has been, destroyed every year and so, if the afforestation activity cannot be undertaken as a campaign the  will be completely disappearing and desertification process will increase within the next 20 to 25 years.
"
5864,"On the one hand the situation is very critical and if we review the efforts and achievements of the two periodic plans though top priority was given in these two plans only 47,000 hectares could be covered by afforestation. Thus in two plans or in 10 years if 47,000 hectares have been afforested on the one hand, on the other side the destruction. of the forest in one year is more than 2 times that of the afforestion in 10 years.
"
5865,"By controlling the depleting forest on the one hand, it its necessary to maintain situational balance again, on the other it is obligatory to fulfil the daily needs of timber, firewood, grass etc. and raw materials for the industry.
"
5866,"Otherwise the country will loose the flaura and fauna because of the situational imbalances along with the adverse effect on the economy of the hills from the loss in productivity, lack of forest products, etc.
"
5867,"With these problems in the coming years forest products will be a sort of rare commodity.
"
5868,"Because of increasing practice of burning cowdung cake and constant land erosion productivity in agriculture will drop miserably. To meet the immediate needs then small trees will be felled and forest products will get rarer and with the increase in land erosion every day calamities like floods, landslides will be a common sight.
"
5869,"It is obvious that the economic problem will enlarge out of proportion.
"
5870,"Small scale efforts would not solve this critical situation.
"
5871,"The most serious fact is that whatever forest is left it is not possible to meet the current needs of firewood and timber without destroying the forest wealth.
"
5872,"If afforestation is not carried out on warfooting the situation will go from bad to worse.
"
5873,"Hence in the Seventh Plan afforestation must be done in 200,000 hectares with full determination and confidence and it is necessary to fulfil the daily necessities by preserving the forests scientifically planting trees which are fast growing and of suitable variety with the people's participation.
"
5874,"Similarly in the problem-laden locations pioneering efforts have to be put in maintaining situational balance by preserving the existing natural resources by land protection and other methods.
"
5875,"On top of it, it is necessary to produce the basic medicines using the herbs, a part of the forest products, export the forest products in the finished and semi -finished forms; it is necessary and desirable to carry out all the activities related to forest development with labour intensive methods like increasing the employment opportunities in the rural areas, for bringing improvement in the social upliftment and economic situation of the country. Objectives
"
5876,"On the basis of the above background the following objectives are set in the Seventh Plan.
"
5877,"1. To fulfil the people's daily needs of forest products keeping in view of supplying major portion of the daily needs of forest products of the people like firewood, timber, grass, etc. forest development will be effected by giving top priority to the worst forest areas.
"
5878,"2. To maintain the situational balance
"
5879,"To re-establish the deteriorating situational balance through different prorammes of afforestation and watershed preservation,
"
5880,"3. To derive maximum economic gains from the forest products
"
5881,"To increase the economic gains by exporting herbs and other forest products available in the country.
"
5882,"Policies of the Seventh Plan
"
5883,"1. By encouraging maximum participation of the people in the afforestation programme for fulfilling the needs of daily life such as timber, firewood, leaves and grass, afforestation will be carried out wildly and afforested areas protected.
"
5884,"Target of the Seventh Plan
"
5885,"Programme of the Seventh Plan
"
5886,"A. 	Afforestation
"
5887,"Afforestation will be carried out in 175,000 hectares in the plan period in order to implement the afforestation programme widely for fulfiling the objective set by the Plan.
"
5888,"According to the target set afforestation will be carried out in 65,000 hectares at the Government level and in 110,000 hectares through the people by motivating them. For this the following working policy will be adopted:
"
5889,"1. 1 	In the districts where the management plan is ready high yield afforestation will take place according to the set plan by avoiding low value or unproductive forest.
"
5890,"In the district where the management plan is not ready the district forest office will determine the unproductive forest and naked hills for carrying out afforestation every year.
"
5891,"1.2 	First priority will be given in afforestation in the hills and districts with precarious forests.
"
5892,"1.3 	District forest offices will set up nurseries and produce saplings for afforestation. 1 .4 	Consideration will be given to preservation without using barbed wire fence in afforestation.
"
5893,"2. For fulfilling the daily needs the approach of maintaining the forest area by re-afforestation by corporations like the T. C. N., Fuel Corporation and the Department of Forests in the areas where they have carried out felling operation.
"
5894,"Under this approach afforestation will be carried out in 25,000 hectares with fast growing species and preserved accordingly.
"
5895,"The following working policy will be adopted.
"
5896,"2. 1 	District forest offices will provide necessary technical assistance and manpower for afforestation by the corporations for this.
"
5897,"2.2 	With the consideration of preservation of afforestation without barbed wire fence local people will be hired for this works.
"
5898,"Wherever fencing is necessary local materials like stones or tree branches will be used in order to increase employment opportunities and saving of foreign exchange. Afforestation through Motivation of People
"
5899,"With the outlook of having maximum afforestation by motivating people more than by government sector direct involvement, afforestation will be carried out in 110,000 hectares of land.
"
5900,"With the aim of providing assistance for motivating people for all afforestation works, one nursery in each area of the 9 areas of the district will be established in addition to the existing nurseries and the responsibility will be given to the local panchayats individual or service centres.
"
5901,"To increase awareness in the minds of the people for the afforestation and preservation works and with the aim of preparing manpower for the future, by selecting one interested teacher in each of the primary or middle schools throughout the country, training will be given on afforestation and preservation. Through the selected teachers the importance of establishment of nurseries and afforestation will be explained to the students and afforestation will be started in the selected places.
"
5902,"On top of it arousing interest on programmes like forest preservation community forest and afforestation programme publicity and promotion will be carried widely, and the teachers will have a big role in motivating the rural private sector in afforestation.
"
5903,"The concerned teachers will not only be encouraged but attractive rewards will be given to the efficient and excellent teachers and students.
"
5904,"The following afforestation activities will be carried through the motivation of people.
"
5905,"1. With the aim of making the rural people self-sufficient in timber, firewood, dried leaves, wide afforestation and preservation will be carried by handling over the government forests to the community.
"
5906,"In addition to the preservation of the existing forests under this programme afforestation will be carried out in 65,000 hectares as Panchayat and Panchayat preserved forests.
"
5907,"1.8 	A contact person or group will be nominated in each panchayat where programme will be implemented and encouragement will be given for providing assistance to the panchayat or individuals for formulation and implementation of the programme in developing forests and bringing imp rovements in the environment by working in their respective domestic fields. 1.9 	In such afforestation programmes 15 to 20 % will be dalegrass plantation.
"
5908,"2. Afforestation will be carried out in a total area of 20,000 hectares in all the five development regions of the country.
"
5909,"The following working policy will be adopted for this : 2.1
"
5910,"Arrangement will be made to have afforestation by creating private forest areas at the rate of five hectares in five year period in each panchayat. respective schools for growing saplings, afforestation and developing manpower for future and encouraging participation in afforestation activity by establishing nurseries in the Panchayats where the school is located.
"
5911,"On top of it if industries wish to have their own forest they will be allocated forest areas for afforestation.
"
5912,"Just like the private sector afforestation programme, encoura gement will be given in making available technical and financial assistance under this programme.
"
5913,"4. Afforestation and preservation will be carried out by making saplings and technical advice available throughout the country for afforestation around the res idential areas, school compound, offices, etc, Under this programme for lalegrass, timber, firewood, etc. throughout the country a total of 24,000,000 saplings will be distributed for afforestation in 10,000 hectares.
"
5914,"The following working policy will be adopted for this:
"
5915,"4. 1 	The practice will be adopted for production of saplings adequately for the annual programme while producing spa lings for every year distribution programme of the previous year will be reviewed.
"
5916,"4.2 	Saplings will be freely distributed by the district offices and publicity and promotion will be one in the districts about this programme.
"
5917,"4.3 	 office will keep a constant vigil whether saplings are planted or not and whether preservation is carried out or not every year.
"
5918,"4.4 	Arrangement will be made to reward in order of first, second and third on the basis of survival rates, when 50 or more saplings are planted by the family or school or office.
"
5919,"4.5 	By extending agro-forestry process interest of the people will be aroused.
"
5920,"4.6 	Among the saplings to be distributed 25 % will be dalegrass.
"
5921,"Distribution will be made in coordination with the agriculture office.
"
5922,"B. 	 Preservation Programme
"
5923,"The following working policy will be adopted for the preservation and maintenance of forest:
"
5924,"1. Management systems will be adopted for preservation of each forest area.
"
5925,"2. As far as possible barbed wire fencing' for preservation work will be discouraged and the approach will be taken to select some individuals among the local inhabitants who have direct connection with the forest entrusted with the responsibility for its preservation.
"
5926,"By paying wages to the preservation workers as an incentive employment opportunities will be increased and the outlook will be to maximise mobilisation of people's participation.
"
5927,"The outlook will be taken to have maximum preservation of forest through people's participation. 3. District forest office will observe periodically as to whether proper preservation is done or not in the afforested area and existing forest, and adopt the practice of preservation in all ways.
"
5928,"4. Loss in the forest by grazing will be minimised by encouraging the people to follow stall feeding through publicity and promotion about its importance for feeding the cattle.
"
5929,"5. To carry out publicity and promotion about the importance of the panchayat forest, panchayat preserved forest, private forest, contract forest, government sector and disseminate the management principles in simple language and arouse awareness about the availability 	of 	forest 	products continuously if managed accordingly.
"
5930,"6. To implement the necessary publicity and promotion programmes about the importance of preservation of forest by taking the outlook of mo bilisation of people's participation in the preservation works.
"
5931,"7. It will be the programme to let the people know about the contribution on maintaining natural balance and social upliftment from the results of implementing forest preservation programme as a sample by selecting one area in the headquarter of each development region.
"
5932,"Programmes like source of water, habitation farming, check dam in the watershed area on either side of the important roads, gally control, landslide control, terrace improvement, etc. will be implemented for protection keeping in view of the situation of depleting of natural flaura and fauna and dropping of agricultural productivity of the country because of destruction of ecology if land erosion is not controlled in time.
"
5933,"By conducting studies every year on the areas where formidable forms will be taken due to land erosion, on areas identified as worst and bad watershed areas protection programmes will be implemented on countrywide basis by giving top priority.
"
5934,"The following working policy will be adopted for implementing this programme:-
"
5935,"1. Under the watershed protection programmes, erosion prone areas will be given highest priority than areas where land erosion has taken abnormal proportions.
"
5936,"2. Countrywide protection programmes will be implemented through the local people by making them conscious and active on this instead of the government office selecting and implementing the project.
"
5937,"From this consideration the approach will be taken to see that government institutions will function like an instrument to implement the programme through the people by making them conscious rather than the institution which implements the programme directly on its own.
"
5938,"3. Watershed .protection committee will be established consisting of local teacher, ex-military personnel and well-known persons for deriving direct benefits of watershed protection programme.
"
5939,"By making arrangements for training, study tours, etc. on watershed protection to the members of the committee they will be made efficient, aware and conscious.
"
5940,"Protection works will be carried out through these committees by providing technical services and making equipment available to them in connection with protection.
"
5941,"4. Attractive rewards will be given to the panchayats, committees and individuals Who prove to be excellent in land and watershed protection works.
"
5942,"5. One project in each of the headquarters of the development region will be established as a sample to demonstrate how economically and easily watershed protection can be carried out.
"
5943,"6. Education on protection, publicity and information will be imparted to the local people about the necessity of becoming austere in the use of natural resource, of carrying out scientific land use and of becoming self- sufficient in production of natural resources.
"
5944,"D. National Parks and Wildlife Preservation Programme
"
5945,"The programme will be to preserve, promote and manage properly the wildlife which are rare, important and in the verge of extinction, in parks established in different geographical areas and wildlife sanctuaries.
"
5946,"Working Policy
"
5947,"The programme will be implemented to add essential facilities normally, required for running national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and hunting sanctuaries established in the Sixth Plan.
"
5948,"E. 	Herbal Farming, Extension and Processing Programme
"
5949,"The programme will be to process 1,550 metric tons of herbs by extending herbal farming to 250 hectares.
"
5950,"The following working policy will be adopted for this :
"
5951,"1. Farming of herbs which are successful in the experimental farming and which can derive economic benefit will be extended at the government, non-government and commercial levels.
"
5952,"2. Necessary seeds, saplings and technical assistance will be provided to farmers who are willing to take up herbal farming.
"
5953,"3. Farmers will be provided with the know-how and techniques on farming after carrying proper research on appropriate techniques and varieties of herbs for inter-cropping with the agricultural crops in the important areas which appear different from the consideration of climate, soil and altitude.
"
5954,"4. Publicity and promotion of herbal farming will be expanded and people will be informed about the price and gains from herbal farming.
"
5955,"5. Attractive rewards will be given to the farmers who prove to be pioneers in the field of herbal farming.
"
5956,"6. By extending herbal farming in the existing farms they will be made self-sufficient. F. 	Botanical Preservation and Development Programme
"
5957,"Studies and research activities will be carried out on plants collected from different parts of the country.
"
5958,"Basic statistics will be collected by conducting surveys on economically useful plants and scientific facts will be published and necessary preservation of rare plants will be attempted. The following working policy will be adopted for this :
"
5959,"1. To produce seeds and saplings which will be economically beneficial, techniques will be developed for conducting research on development of vegetation connected with the people's life and for using them.
"
5960,"G. Medical Research and Technique Development Programme
"
5961,"Programmes such as research on pharmaceutical production, analysis and testing of medicines and development of techniques based on the medical value and economically important Nepalese botanical species will be carried out.
"
5962,"The following working policy will be adopted for this :
"
5963,"To supply medicines to the people at reasonable price, to maintain the quality of necessary medicines required for effective health services, and to produce effective medicine by using most modern pharmaceutical techniques the Royal Drugs Limited will be permitted to produce 35 varie ties of new medicines in the Seventh Plan.
"
5964,"Training Programme
"
5965,"For the successful implementation of forest development, land and watershed protection and related programmes necessary training programmes will be conducted.
"
5966,"Research Programme
"
5967,"Research programme will be implemented in order to solve the problems such as lack of forest products, land erosion calamities faced by the country and to support different programmes.
"
5968,"The following working policy will be adopted for this :
"
5969,"1. Research will be carried out for planting fast growing saplings and plants suitable to the areas having different altitudes, soil and climate and developing techniques for growing and management systems.
"
5970,"2. Research will be carried out for techniques for protecting the land and watershed economically.
"
5971,"3. Research will be conducted for developing techniques related to agro forestry for the areas which appear to be different from the consideration of climate, soil and altitudes.
"
5972,"K. 	Other Programmes
"
5973,"1. Timber, Firewood Production
"
5974,"Production and marketing of timber and firewood will be done by the corporation and committee on the basis of markings done by the Department of Forests, Ministry of Forest and Land Protection in the specified spot of the forest keeping in mind the environment balance.
"
5975,"2. Turpentine Industry
"
5976,"By completing the constructions works of the turpentine industry initiated in the 'Sixth Plan production of rosin and turpentine will be started.
"
5977,"L. Rehabilitation Programme
"
5978,"With regard to the rehabilitation executed by clear felling of invaluable forest resources, the forest area has been reduced to less than the minimum required for maintaining the natural and ecological balance and, hence, there is no room for rehabilitation by converting the forest land to agricultural land by clear felling in the hills or terai.
"
5979,"Programmes will be imple mented in the Seventh Plan according to the policy of giving a or land allocation just enough to engage in small industrial undertakings for settling the victims of natural calamities by giving training in the hills and terai. The following working policy will be adopted for this :
"
5980,"1. Rehabilitation will be carried out by establishing rehabilitation centres at feasible places and by allocating land for residential plots for industries and trades.
"
5981,"2. The victims will be handed in skills for associating them in some vocation or small scale industries.
"
5982,"3. Services will be made available to the victims from the rehabilitation centres for a definite period only.
"
5983,"(A) Road Transportation
"
5984,"As a result of top priority given in the initial periodic plans to launching and implementation of projects related to development of transport sector, providing physical infrastructure for all-around development of the country, most parts of the country are now interlinked internally without the compulsion of having to use foreign land for transportation. The achievements made in the field internally without the compulsion of having to foreign land for transportation.
"
5985,"The achievements made in the field of road transportation over the last three decades of planned development are certainly encouraging.
"
5986,"The length of road in the kingdom by fiscal year 1976/80, the final year of the Fifth Plan, came up to 4,940 kilometer as compared to mere 624 km, is fiscal year 1955/56, the first year of the First Plan period.
"
5987,"By the end of fiscal year 1983/84, the fourth year of the Sixth Plan (19979/80-1984/85), a total length of 5,717 km. roads of different kinds have been constructed in the country.
"
5988,"While analyzing the current situation of roads, it can be observed that black-topped roads have taken crucial position. gradual increase in the length of roads has bolstered not only the linkage of north-south and east-west parts of the Kingdom but also contributed to the formation of necessary infrastructures for socio-economic development of the country.
"
5989,"The situation of roads by development regions has also envisaged gradual improvement following the implementation of projects relating to roads development.
"
5990,"The length of roads in Eastern, Central, Western, Mid - Western and Far-Western Development Regions by fiscal year 1979/80, the final year of the Fifth Plan, was 1,052 km, 190 km, 679 km and 358 km respectively.
"
5991,"The length of roads by this period (fiscal year 198384) is 1,322 km in Eastern, 2,109 km in Central, 1,097 km in Western, 725 km in Mid-western and 464 in Far-western Development Regions respectively.
"
5992,"The situation of roads in accordance with their standard in different development regions is presented below.
"
5993,"Of the total length of 5,717 km. roads by the fourth year (1983/84) of the sixth plan, the highest length of roads on zonal basis is in Bagmati zone, both in quantity and kind.
"
5994,"Of the above total length in the kingdom, Bagmati zone has 1,109 km, (19.40 percent).
"
5995,"Lumbini zone, with second position, has a length of 792 km roads.
"
5996,"Mechi, Koshi, Sagarmatha, Janakpur, Gandaki, Rapti, Bheri, Seti and Mahakali zones have 570, 388, 364, 429, 305, 454, 271, 183 and 281 km. roads respectively. The following table presents the comparative situation of road in different zones.
"
5997,"The slash in road length is due to elimination of Pokhara-Kunchha road. The above table shows that except for Karnali and Dhawalagiri zones, the situation of roads in other zones is improving step by step.
"
5998,"Progress Review of the Sixth Plan
"
5999,"The current Sixth Plan had proposed to construct a number of roads and bridges and launch other related programs with the objectives of consolidating national and regional integrity by linking different parts of the country, bolstering economic and social uplift with the maintenance of regional balance, linking tourist resorts and project sites of national importance and, developing and expanding rural transportation.
"
6000,"Programs and projects for the development of roads were incorporated in the Sixth Plan keeping in mind the above policies and working policies.
"
6001,"Likewise the working policies related to suspension bridges and improved  over streams and rivulets on village trails also remained incomplete. As for the physical progress achieved during the plan, altogether 1,516-kilometer road was constructed by the fourth year of the plan against the plan period.
"
6002,"Keeping in view the target set for the final year of the Sixth Plan (fiscal year 1984/85), altogether 1,749-km. road is expected to be constructed during the plan period. The progress as per target would come up to 89.69 percent.
"
6003,"The following table presents the target and progress relating to roads construction during the Sixth Plan.
"
6004,"On analyzing the process achieved in road sector in the Sixth Plans period, it becomes clear that the implementation level of back-topped road was the best.
"
6005,"O the total target of constructing 672 km. back-topped road in the whole plan period,601 km. has already has been constructed in the first four years achieving a progress of 89.44 percent as per target.
"
6006,"The progress in this direction, hence, seems to go as per target.
"
6007,"The progress of gravel led road seems to fall short of target whereas that of fair weather rough motorable road is expected to exceed the target.
"
6008,"The entire roads project implemented in the Sixth plan with the objective of achieving the above physical targets were categorized under three main programs, namely highways, feeder roads, and main urban and headquarters roads.
"
6009,"Accordingly, 562 km. of highways, 797 km. of feeder roads and 157 km. main urban and headquarters roads were constructed during the first four years of the Sixth plan.
"
6010,"The following table presents the achievements made in the first four years of the Sixth Plan in roads construction on the basis of their kind.
"
6011,"As for projects implementation, blacktopping has been carried out on the remaining 38 km portion of
"
6012,"Hetauda-Narayangadh road, 154 km of Butwal-Kohalpur road, and among north-south highways. 40 km of Dharan-Dhankuta road, 61 km of Gorkha-Narayangadh road and 30 km of Mahendra highway (Charili) Kanyam- Illam road.
"
6013,"In addition the 73. km Illam-Fidim road has been improved for truck transport ation.
"
6014,"Likewise the construction of Dadeldhura-Baitadi-Darchula road is expected to proceed as per target.
"
6015,"Construction of the 84 m Dadeldhura-Dipayal-Doti road in the Far-Western Development Region is to be completed to suit one-line truck transportation.
"
6016,"But Kohalpur-Mahalkali road and Mahendra highway (Kohalpur)-Surkhet road is not likely to be completed as per target.
"
6017,"Feeder roads such Mahendra highway-Sanischare, Mahendra highway-Ggauriganj, Mahendra highway- Shripur, Trishuli-Gandaki, Nepalgunj-Baghada, Nepalganj-Gulariya have remained initial phase.
"
6018,"Evaluation the progress during the last four years vindicates that the promotion of panchayat roads to feeder roads and construction of roads under integrated rural development projects are to fall short of target.
"
6019,"Bottlenecks and Problems
"
6020,"The reasons for gap between target and progress in the current plan are attributed to failure to reach agreement on projects such as Kohalpur-Mahakali road on time, failure to carry out feasibility study, lack of timely distribution of contract, shortage of construction materials and equipment negligence of contractors to carry out works on time and the like.
"
6021,"Bridges and Suspension Bridges
"
6022,"Of the 15 motorable bridges including those on Tribhuvan highway and Pathlaiya-Dhalkevar portion of Mahendra highway targeted to be constructed in the current Sixth plan, six bridges have been completed and a maximum of three expected to be completed in the fiscal year1984/85, the total bridges to be constructed coming up to nine only.
"
6023,"The Duhabi bridge (Sunsari), Man bridge (Bardia) and the bridges on Hetauda-Narayangadh portion were completed during the period.
"
6024,"As for reconstruction of bridges, the  (nearing completion), the bridge leading to Mahendra Gufa (Kaski) and the bridge on Pathalaiya Dhalkebar portion of Manendra highway were completed.
"
6025,"Of the targeted 300 suspension bridge to be constructed during the Sixth Plan, 99 suspension bridge have been constructed in the fourth year (1982/84) of the plan period and an additional 56 are expected to be constructed in the final year (1984/85). Thus the number of suspension bridges constructed in the Sixth Plan is expected to reach 155.
"
6026,"The reasons for not fulfilling the target of motorable bridges are lack of timely designing, problem problems relating to constructs and also low efficiency in Department of Roads to construct bridges.
"
6027,"Likewise the bottlenecks facing suspension bridge sector, are lack of timely awarding of constructs, transportation problem of construction materials, shortage of technicians and problem of choosing project site.
"
6028,"Financial Progress
"
6029,"The Sixth Plan had targeted to spend Rs 3020 million at fixed price for the conduction of roads development programs including bridges.
"
6030,"Of the total sum of Rs 3020 million Rs 2390 million was allocated for roads (including foot trail, mule trail and motorable road) and Rs 630 million for bridges and suspension bridges.
"
6031,"By the end of the Sixth Plan, in fiscal year 1984/85, the expenditure in the current ma rket price is to reach Rs3235.5 million.
"
6032,"The particulars of expenditures are given in the table below.
"
6033,"Objective, Policies and Programs of the Seventh Plan More attention has to be paid to development of roads and bridges, which occupy important place in transportation.
"
6034,"Although the total length of roads is to reach 6,000 km by the end of the Sixth Plan in fiscal year 1984/85, works to link hilly areas to terai and to eliminate inaccessibility of most of the hilly districts by providing roads transportation have yet to be done.
"
6035,"It is more evident in the context of increasing demand by panchayat units and local people.
"
6036,"Keeping in mind our past experiences in this field, more alertness is called for in roads construction as well as in rendering the roads constructed inn the plan periods economically more used.
"
6037,"A study report carried out in 1983 showed that the density of vehicular traffic and some of the important highways was 500 km vehicles per days, while that on some other roads 200 to 300 vehicles per day.
"
6038,"Lack of congenial environment to render roads, especially highway, more useful from economic point of view is responsive for low traffic density.
"
6039,"On the other hand maintenance of roads is a very expensive task in a country like Nepal Roads which give very low economic benefit are neglected in maintenance, too, and investment in such roads is fruitless.
"
6040,"In view of these facts, more alertness is called for Seventh Plan concerning the programmes in road development.
"
6041,"Working Policy
"
6042,"The following working policies will be adopted to achieve the above objectives and successful implementation of above policies.
"

"
6201,"F. Feasibility Study, Design and Survey Works
"
6202,"The Seventh Plan target is to conduct feasibility studies and detailed survey works on the highways included in the Sixth Plan and those that are deemed important from the transit and foreign trade point of view under the central level program. Some of the major roads proposed for the feasibility studies are 1) Sindhuli-Kvre 2) Ridhi-Dhorpatan and other roads, which are important from national viewpoint.
"
6203,"G. Miscellaneous Under this heading, the programs included are traffic survey and research, land acquisition and compensation, construction and repair of mule track in Darchula Tinkerbyas and other stray works.
"
6204,"Tariff Survey and Research are important in order to reduce and control traffic accidents on various roads in the Kingdom.
"
6205,"Therefore, Traffic survey and research will be conducted on various roads during the Seventh Plan
"
6206,"Land Acquisition and Compensation
"
6207,"Construction of highways and feeder roads claims private land of individuals.
"
6208,"Therefore acquisition of such land and payment of compensation thereof will be continued during the Seventh Plan also.
"
6209,"Darchula Tinker Mule Track
"
6210,"The mule track linking Darchula and Tinker in the Far-western Development Region is one of the national priority projects.
"
6211,"The mule track construction was initiated by the Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development during the Sixth Plan.
"
6212,"The remaining work will be completed during the Seventh Plan.
"
6213,"Bridge and Suspension Bridges
"
6214,"In the context of , it is but natural that bridge, suspension bridge and other means of crossing rivers assume great importance while formulating transportation development program.
"
6215,"Therefore top priority was given to the construction of bridge and suspension bridges in the previous plans.
"
6216,"An analysis of our achievements in bridge construction during the past years indicates that more efforts are needed in this regard and a separate bridge construction unit is required within the concerned department in order to implement bridge construction.
"
6217,"On the one hand, there has been an unprecedented growth in the demand for the construction of motorable bridges in various parts of the Kingdom due to the problems created by the numerous rivers especially during the rainy season. On the other hand, various projects included in the Plan have remained incomplete.
"
6218,"Several bridges, launched during the Sixth Plan, could not be completed due to the lack of increased capability in bridge designing at the Roads Department.
"
6219,"Keeping in mind the capability of the Roads Department and limited resources available, the target of the Seventh Plan has been fixed to construct 23 bridges.
"
6220,"Construction work on Jamara river (Kailali), Bhada bridge (Bardia), Sirsia bridge (Parsa), Keshlaya bridge (Morang), Bakraha bridge (Morang), Red bridge (Jaleshwar) will be completed during the Plan period.
"
6221,"Concerning reconstruction of bridges, the red bridge on Shankhamul and Dhobikhola rivers, and other bridges in Babar Mahal, Siphal and Handigaon will be reconstructed. Similarly construction of bridges on the Bishnumati river across Bhimsen Than, Shobha Bhagati and Dallu will be completed.
"
6222,"Five bridges on the road from Naubise to Raxual section will also be reconstructed.
"
6223,"Necessary feasibility study and survey for the bridge construction will be continued during the Seventh Plan also. The bridge over   (Kailala) will be designed and constructed under the feeder road project within the Plan period, Besides, study will be conducted to construct a motorable bridge around Teku between  and Lalitpur.
"
6224,"Backlog projects from the Sixth plan are also targeted for completion on priority basis.
"
6225,"Suspension Bridges
"
6226,"As Suspension bridges are one important means of rural transportation system, the center should provide technical back-up for the successful completion of suspension bridge programs being undertaken by local panchayat.
"
6227,"In this background, steps will be taken strengthen suspension bridge division at the center.
"
6228,"In the context of Decentralization Act and Regulations the role of central level agencies will be re-oriented to provide necessary technical backing to the rural transportation program rather than involve directly in construction works.
"
6229,"The Seventh Plan also envisages for the development of rural transport system (1) preparation of directory manual for the training of technical personnel of the districts engaged in the construction suspension bridges, and (2) research and studies to development cable crossing of rivers and streams in the rural hilly areas.
"
6230,"Financial Targets
"
6231,"The fiscal outlay set-aside for the district level road development program for the Seventh Planis Rs 394.50 million.
"
6232,"Though a small country,  has numerous rivers and streams due to the diverse geographical structures.
"
6233,"A large area of  consists of hills and high mountains in Himalayan region. The absence of bridges and suspension bridges in most of the rivers and streams has created problems in transportation across different places and villages.
"
6234,"This problem becomes especially that bridge and suspension bridges are essential to provide transportation facilities in the hilly and remote districts, which have numerous rivers and streams.
"
6235,"In view of the limited available resources under our disposal, it will still require a long time to provide motor road transportation network in al parts of the country.
"
6236,"In this context the construction of bridge and suspension bridges on major rivers along the main foot tracks in the hilly and remote regions will also greatly facilitate the movement of common people in rural areas.
"
6237,"Keeping this fact in mind, the construction of bridges and suspension bridges as an integral part of rural transportation was accorded top priority since the Fifth Plan.
"
6238,"The Sixth Plan emphasized the suspension bridge construction as one of the basic needs of the people.
"
6239,"The achievements made in the suspension bridge construction during the past periodic plans reveal that only 10 projects were completed during the Fourth Plan while the figure for the Fifth Plan was 61.
"
6240,"The target for suspension bridge construction for the Fifth Plan was set at maximum and minimum targets were 91 and 145 percent respectively.
"
6241,"During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, the Suspension Bridges Division had completed 98 suspension bridges.
"
6242,"Thus during the first four years f the Sixth Plan, 33 percent of the target has been fulfilled. The regional distribution of the 98 suspension bridges constructed by the Suspension Bridge Division is: Eastern Development Region 15 and Far Western Region 8.
"
6243,"The annual progress recorded during the first four years of the Sixth Plan was: fiscal year 1980/81:30; F.Y.1981/82:26; F.Y.1983/84:16.
"
6244,"The suspension bridges completed by the Suspension Bridge Division during the first four years of the Sixth Plan are follows:
"
6245,"In addition to the Suspension Bridge Division, number of suspension bridges constructed during the first four years of the Sixth Plan under the Remote Area Development Programme of Ministry of Panchayat and Local Development was 39 and 107 bridges under IRD Projects.
"
6246,"Therefore, in consonance with the Decentralization Act and Principles, the centrally administered suspension bridge construction programme will be formulated on the basis of the felt needs of the district and implemented accordingly.
"
6247,"The following policy consideration will be stressed while formulating suspension bridge programme under the District Level Plan: 1.
"
6248,"Complete the backlog projects from the Sixth Plan.
"
6249,"2. Accord priority to the construction of suspension bridges over the rivers on the way to Development Centres and district headquarters. 3. As cable crossing of the rivers in rural areas can be constructed at less cost compared to the suspension bridges, consideration will be given to construct safe cable crossing in the streams and rivers along the foot and mule track which have less movement of people.
"
6250,"4. Undertake pilot programmes to construct suspension bridges, utilizing ocal skills, techniques and manpower while constructing intra -village and low span suspension bridges, and emphasize low cost programmes benefiting a larger number of people.
"
6251,"Based on the above policies and objectives, the centrally administered suspension bridge programmes for the districts during the Seventh Plan have been classified into the following five headings: 1) Suspension bridge construction. 2) Reconstruction and repair of suspension bridges, 3) Feasibility study, and survey.
"
6252,"4) Development of cable crossing, and 5) Miscellaneous.
"
6253,"(1) 	Construction of Suspension Bridges During the Seventh Plan, 373 suspension bridges will be constructed in different districts.
"
6254,"Of this, 40 are backlog projects and 332 will be new projects.
"
6255,"Emphasis will be given to construct suspension bridges on the main foot track and over the rivers on the way to district headquarters.
"
6256,"(2) 	Reconstruction and Maintenance of Suspension Bridges:
"
6257,"This project has been included to ensure reconstruction and maintenance of suspe nsion bridges constructed in the districts, Maintenance of various district suspension bridges will be carried out during the Seventh Plan.
"
6258,"(3) 	Feasibility Study and Survey: Surveying and designing of bridges are important before construction.
"
6259,"Feasibility study projects have been included to evaluate necessity and select suspension bridges in the districts.
"
6260,"There cannot be two opinions about the potential for the development of rope-line, waterways and electric powered transportation system for a hilly country like  with a large number of rivers and streams.
"
6261,"However, even after three decades of planned development process, the progress made in this sector has made little impact on the National Transportation System.
"
6262,"The Seventh Plan has given special emphasis on these programmes for their potential benefit to the national economy.
"
6263,"Background of the Seventh Plan
"
6264,"Besides roads and air transport development,  has yet to accomplish a lot in the development of railways, ropeways, waterways and other means of transportation. A review of past achievements and the current situation shows that these means of transportation should be developed in a complementary: way with attention given to curtail the growing reliance on petroleum products.
"
6265,"In view of the better potential of electric powered transportation system in , concrete steps were taken in this direction is expected to yield positive impact on the nation's balance-of-paymants situation. As a land-locked country,  is facing various difficulties in transit of goods, bothin export to and import from the other countries because of the lack of suitable means of transportation. port is important for 's trade with the third countries.
"
6266,"During the Fifth Plan, the volumes of export passing through various border customs offices were 62%, 12%, 9% and 3% through Biratnagar, Birgunj, Kakarbhitta and Bhadrapur respectively.
"
6267,"A total of 71  percent of imports passed through Birgunj customs office followed by Biratnagar (11 percent), Bhairahawa (8 percent) and Nepalgunj (3 percent). thus, both  and  are likly to benefit if Indian cooperation could be secured to convert meter gauge Indian rail head into broad guageline upto one of the important customs offices on  side considered important from transit view point.
"
6268,"Similarly, concerete steps should be taken to better organise domestic transport development programme related to transit purpose.
"
6269,"In this context, various studies have indicated that the development of inter model containerized transportation system will reduce transit expenses considerably.
"
6270,"The objectives, policies and programmes for the development and expansion of the transport systems were formulated in this light.
"
6271,"Objectives
"
6272,"The objectives for other transport development during the Seventh Plan are as follows:
"
6273,"Financial Targets and Progress
"
6274,"The Sixth Plan had provided the financial outlay of Rs 780 million for various programmes and projects concerning air transport development.
"
6275,"During the first four years of the Sixth Plan, a total of Rs 476.6 million was expended at the current market price and the estimated expenditure for the last year of the Plan 1984,185 was Rs 171.2 million; this makes the total expenditure of Rs 646.8 million at the current price for the entire plan period.
"
6276,"Problems and Constraints Experienced during the Sixth Plan
"
6277,"During the Sixth Plan period, a number of problems were encountered while executing air transport development programmes which pushed the national priority projects like  and Nepalgunj airport project behind the schedule.
"
6278,"Some of the problems encountered were delay in construction work and tender processing, failure to deliver construction materials to site on time and delay in land acquisition for projects.
"
6279,"Excessive delay in processing contract documents on the international terminal building of  has created a massive problem of price escalation.
"
6280,"Moreover, a lot of construction projects are undertaken without detailed feasibility studies and on the basis of rough estimates of cost which results in various problems.
"
6281,"Therefore, the programmes of the Seventh Plan are formulated keeping in mind the problems and constraints experienced so far.
"
6282,"Classification of Airports Satisfactory progress has been made in the number of airports constructed in the country since 1950.
"
6283,"It is apparent that these airports have varying degree of significance in terms of their location and services.
"
6284,"Therefore, a classification of these airports is in order.
"
6285,"The existing basic physical facilities and communication and navigational aids are not uniformly available in all the airports.
"
6286,"The airports have been classified as outlined in the Sixth Plan into A, B, C and D category keeping in mind the priority of installing additional facilities in certain selected airports.
"
6287,"Thus, the air ports in various categories are: A- Tribhuvan International Airport, ; B- Biratnagar, Pokhara, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj; C- Bhadrapur, Janakpur, Simra, Meghauli and Dhangadi; and D- remaining all other airports and stol airfields.
"
6288,"POSTAL SERVICE
"
6289,"It stood at one post office for every 9,238 population in 1983.84 the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan.
"
6290,"In view of the expected achievement in the establishment of 30 sub-post offices and 40 additional post offices in 1984/85- the last year of the Sixth Plan, 471 post offices, which makes 98.00 percent of planned target, are expected to be established with in Sixth Plan period.
"
6291,"Similarly, regarding mail service improvement and expansion, the Sixth Plan envisaged the establishment of 30 postal lines with 24 postal lines already established during the first four years, the said target is expected to be fulfilled by the Plan period.
"
6292,"As part of support for mail delivery four delivery vans, four scooter vans and 650 cycles were procured in the first four years of the Plan period against the target of six mail vans, 11 mail scooter vans and 500 cycles for mailmen respectively. It is expected that 100 cycles will be procured to the final year.
"
6293,"Regarding construction and expansion programs of post office buildings 85 buildings (75.89 percent) buildings are completed in the first four years of the Plan against the target of constructing 112 buildings.
"
6294,"In view of the expected construction of 23 such units, it is expected that 108 buildings would have been constructed by the end of the Plan period thus making 96.43 percent in achievement of planned target.
"
6295,"New construction of eleven post office buildings, expansion of 10 postal offices buildings, 45 aid -buildings and 19 carry-over building projects from the Fifth Plan have been completed in the first four years of the Sixth Plan.
"
6296,"Against these targets, money order services have been provided t hrough 109 post offices and savings banking service through 50 post offices. In view of the target of money order service through. 25 post offices additionally in the final year, i.e. 1984/85, the achievement is expected to surpass the target in this project.
"
6297,"However, no cash on delivery service is made available through any post office.
"
6298,"Against the target of extending postal training to 600 postal employees under miscellaneous programs, 480 persons received training in the first four years of the Plan period.
"
6299,"In view of expected training of 120 persons in 1984/85, the planned target in postal training is expected to be achieved in the Sixth Plan period.
"
6300,"The targets of establishing additional 2500 post boxes and 1500 mail boxes under the postal strengthening project are likely to achieved.
"
6301,"But the establishment of central postrage stams emporium is not likely to be completed.
"
6302,"While the Sixth Plan envisaged the target of extending p ostal service at the rate of one post office for every 8,711 population, it is likely that there will be one post office per 8,987 population by 1984/85, the end of the Plan period.
"
6303,"Presently, there is one post office per 8,926 population by the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, i.e. 1983/84.
"
6304,"Against the target of availing of postal service at the rate of one post office per 77.83 square kilometer on average, one post office per 80.82 square kilometre has been accomplished by 1983/84. Financial Achievement:
"
6305,"The sixth Plan envisaged a total expenditure of Rs 30 million in different programs for post services development. Out of this, an expenditure of Rs 20.267 million at market price has been actually incurred at the end of 1983/84.
"
6306,"Details of expenditures according to programs and years is given below:
"
6307,"Problems in the implementation of various projects in postal services are mainly related i) delays in creating staffs positions and land acquisition, ii) the necessity to make repeated tend3er calls, and iii) frequent incidence of contractors, leaving construction works incomplete.
"
6308,"Objectives, Policies and Programs of the Seventh Plan: The basic objective of postal services in the Seventh Plan is to render postal services efficient and reliable with regional balance.
"
6309,"The efforts will have to be directed at helping support development process by extending to village levels traditional ordinary and registered mail services as well as different economic services related to general peoples.
"
6310,"The following policies will be pursued in order to achieve various objectives related to the development of postal services: 1.
"
6311,"Special emphasis will be given to qualitative improvement in postal services with increased confidentiality and regularity.
"
6312,"Postal units will be increased in order to improve the ratio between post offices and population.
"
6313,"The aim it to establish at least one postal unit in every 'Ilaka' (region) of all districts.
"
6314,"Establishment of post office will be done on the basis of regional balance.
"
6315,"More attention will be given to better management of public post offices and semi-government additional post offices.
"
6316,"Postal Development Program
"
6317,"In order to achieve the physical objectives of the Seventh Plan, different projects will be launched under five programs such as a) establishment of post offices, b) expansion and improvement of postal delivery, c) construction and expansion of postal buildings, d) economic services and e)miscellaneous.
"
6318,"a) Program for the establishment of post offices:
"
6319,"In view of existing ration between the population and post offices, it is essential to bring about improvement in the quantitative situation of post offices.
"
6320,"The number of post offices has to be increased for increase access for more people to post offices.
"
6321,"Thus, the following projects will be implement to establish public and semi-public post offices.
"
6322,"1. Sub-post Office:
"
6323,"Sub post office comes nest to district post office among public post offices.
"
6324,"The sub post office is involved in the transportation of mail between district and additional post offices as well as sale and distribution of postal stamps, envelopes, airogramme ad other postal goods in the process of registration and delivery of mail.
"
6325,"Additional post offices receive stamps through it.
"
6326,"It offers internal money order service.
"
6327,"These district post offices are established on the basis of nine 'Ilakas' (regions) of the district and the extra workloads in different places.
"
6328,"Generally, additional post offices are upgraded to sub post offices.
"
6329,"It is estimated that there would be 397 sub post offices established by 1984/85 the last year of the Sixth
"
6330,"It is envisaged that 175 sub-post offices will be established additionally during the Seventh Plan period.
"
6331,"Thus it is expected that there would be 572 sub post offices by the end of the Seventh Plan period, i.e. 1989/90.
"
6332,"They would be established on the basis of Development of Regions with 35, 35, 35, 35, 45 and 25 units in the Eastern Region, Central Region, Western Region, Mid-western Region, and Far-western Region respectively.
"
6333,"2. Additional Post Office
"
6334,"Additional post office is the lowest level post office and is operated on semi-public basis.
"
6335,"An additional post office consists of one agent and one delivery agent as well as a carrying agent according to need.
"
6336,"Generally it covers 6,000 population within one mile of its distance in mail transportation and distribution.
"
6337,"Additionally, such an additional post office offers sale of stamp aero grammes, money order, carrying insurance order and registration of mail.
"
6338,"It is generally operated on the basis of peoples' participation and is open for two top three hours a day.
"
6339,"It is envisaged that 474 additional post offices would be established during the Seventh Plan period. As a consequence, the number of additional post offices in the country would reach 1863 by 1989/90 in the country.
"
6340,"b) Expansion and improvement of mail delivery:
"
6341,"Improvement and expansion of mail delivery routes, serving as postal lines, and the related means for transportation are important for fast delivery of mail.
"
6342,"Included under this program are: i) 	expansion of postal lines and ii) the system for the means for mail delivery.
"
6343,"1. Expansion of postal lines
"
6344,"Postal lines are the route postmen use for the delivery of mail. It is essential that they are short and direct routes.
"
6345,"Existing direct route across villages, districts and zones will be used for postal lines for fast mail delivery.
"
6346,"There are 62 postal lines in various parts of the country, especially, in the hills and mountain areas.
"
6347,"Mail service has been in operation through airlines and vehicles, whether they are feasible, for fast delivery of mail.
"
6348,"The follow projects will be undertaken in this respect.
"
6349,"Among there are on in Eastern Region, two in Central Region, three in Western Region, two in Mid -western Region and four in Far-western Region.
"
6350,"During this Plan period it is envisaged that addition of stories, room etc. will be completed in ten post offices in different districts in the country.
"
6351,"Two post office buildings will be expanded in each development region. iv) 	Post office building construction with contribution
"
6352,"In view of the need to bring about large increase in the construction of post office buildings at the people's level's with some subsidy (contribution) from the government. Altogether such construction work in 35 post offices have been completed by the end of the four years of the Plan period.
"
6353,"It is expected it will reach 65 units by the end of the period. Thus, because the progress achieved in this field with people's participation has been encouraging, construction of post office building with supplementary government contribution is incorporated in the Seventh Plan too with the objective of constructing additionally such post office buildings.
"
6354,"There will be ten in Eastern Region, twelve in Central Region, ten in Western Region, nine in Mid -western Region and nine in Far-western Region
"
6355,"a. Economic Services
"
6356,"Postal services have not been limited with simple transportation and distribution of letters and goods but have also included economic services such as money order and savings bank that render direct assistance to national development.
"
6357,"These economic services are mainly limited to district headquarters and business centers.
"
6358,"Presently, these services are available only through district post offices and some sub-post offices.
"
6359,"Therefore, i) Money Order Service and ii) Savings Deposit Service are included under economic services in the Seventh Plan.
"
6360,"1. Money Order Services:
"
6361,"Money order service plays an important role in a country like  with large population in lower and medium-level-income groups and limited banking facilities.
"
6362,"Therefore, this service has been continued since the Fifth Plan to facilitate transfer of small amounts of money through post offices from one district to another for the general people.
"
6363,"There is an arrangement for the transfer of up to one thousand rupees between  and  and across different districts of the country.
"
6364,"This service was available in 63 district post offices during the Fifth Plan period and, additionally 109 district post offices provided this service by the end of the four years of the Sixth Plan. This service is now available in all the districts of the country but only through limited number of district post offices.
"
6365,"In view of the money ord er service operating with neighboring country, , there is the need to expand internal money order service to more places.
"
6366,"But, considering the geographical situation and limited resources and manpower, it is but natural that it should take still some time to extend this service to rural areas in the country.
"
6367,"The objective is to extend this service to rural areas without banking facilities although it is presently limited mostly in district headquarters.
"
6368,"It is envisaged that money order service will be made available additionally through public post offices of which there will be 30, 30, 35, 40 and 15 in Eastern Region, Central Region, Western Region, Mid-western Region, Mid -western Region and Far-western Region respectively
"
6369,"2. Postal Savings Bank Service:
"
6370,"This service, offered by the post office, has an important role in inculcating the habit of saving on the part of people in lower level income groups.
"
6371,"Under this service, the minimum deposit accepted is Rs 5 and the maximum at Rs 30,000. Interest offered is as the one offered by other banks.
"
6372,"Started during the Fifth Plan period, this service is gradually extended to different districts of the country.
"
6373,"This service will be expanded during the Seventh Plan too.
"
6374,"e) Miscellaneous:
"
6375,"Several other factors are important for the development of postal services.
"
6376,"The upgrading of the standard of training of postal staff, use of modern equipment and improvement in the collection and distribution of mail have important roles in increasing the efficiency of postal staff.
"
6377,"Therefore, projects related to i) postal training management, ii) postal strengthening iii) establishment of the sorting center and iv) postal master plan have been included in the Seventh Plan.
"
6378,"1. Postal training management:
"
6379,"Postal training management project has been implemented with a view to improve the efficiency to postal staff.
"
6380,"Indeed, the qualitative improvement of postal serv ice depends on this kind training activities.
"
6381,"Training activities with the development of suitable curriculum in order to produce lower and medium level manpower for postal service are undertaken through this center.
"
6382,"This center has been involved in the training of staff of non-official level. This Seventh Plan has envisaged the training of officer-level staff too through this center in various fields and the training of 750 staff during the Plan period.
"
6383,"2. Strengthening of the postal system: There has been significant quantitative increase in the development of postal service in .
"
6384,"However, in view of the limitations in the physical facilities of most of the existing post offices, there is the need for the project, strengthening the postal system.
"
6385,"Capital and non -durable goods are regularly required for the efficient functioning of the postal service. Therefore, institutional reforms regarding Central Stamps Emporium, Stock ledger/Central Money order office, etc., together with essential supplies of capital goods and non-durable goods such as lac, jute thread and sealing stamper are envisaged in the Seventh Plan.
"
6386,"Besides these, strengthening of the Central Post Office on the basis of mechanized technology will be also undertaken.
"
6387,"3. Establishment of the sorting center
"
6388,"Arrangement of the sorting of mail at the proper place enables economical and fast distribution of mail.
"
6389,"A sorting center will be established during the Seventh Plan period in Chitawan district as this district stands at the central po int for surface mail delivery in the country.
"
6390,"4. Study and formulation of the Master Plan
"
6391,"Studies for the qualitative improvement and planned development of postal service will be continued in the Seventh Plan too.
"
6392,"Beside this, formulation of a master plan for the postal service is also envisaged.
"
6393,"Financial Investment:
"
6394,"The following table shows investment in various programs under postal service.
"
6395,"INDUSTRY Background
"
6396,"Prospects for overall economic development will be brighter only if the present structure of the economy, with predominate dependenc3e on traditional agriculture, can be gradually transformed through the process of industrialization.
"
6397,"A desired rate of growth can only be maintained in the national economy only if different economic activities can be expanded and diversified as sustenance of desired rate of growth can only be maintained in the national economy only if different economic activities can be expanded and diversified as sustenance of desired rate of growth is not possible through increase in agricultural production dependent on limited arable land.
"
6398,"On the one hand, the impact of past development endeavors on the growing population has been limited whereas, on the oth4re hand, it has not been possible to accelerate, in pace with growing expectations, the process of development through industrialization. If the trend of inordinate dependence on imports continues, it is likely that a situation will be created whereby the economy will always be characterized by negative effects.
"
6399,"The size and growth of the economy will always be limited and efforts to strengthen the economy through increase investment will yield only marginal results. In this context, industrial development can play a highly meaningful role n replaining unemployment, substitution of imports through increased domestic production and in bringing about a change in the balance of payments situation in favour of the country.
"
6400,"In addition, industrial development can contribute to greater revenue surplus and to higher internal savings. Thus, the importance of industrial development in generation of employment, increase in income, development and extension of traditional skills and technologies, realizing the potentials of latent entrepreneur capabilities and in the utilization of resources and facilities not fully utilized hereto need hardly any elaboration.
"
6401,"In short, the economy can reap significant positive benefits through proper development of the industrial sector.
"
6402,"Delays in the expansion of transport networks and power generation and distribution system, limited size of internal market and the landlocked situation of the country still continue to act as the major impediments in industrial development.
"
6403,"Supply of raw-material for expansion of industrial development has been hindered mainly by the lack of significant increase in agricultural production, decreasing forestry products and by the lack of development and commercial promotion of production of mines and quarries.
"
6404,"As it has not been possible, as yet, to bring about the desired positive changes in the transit system, the prices of both imports to and exports from  are relatively high, thereby rendering Nepalese goods relatively costly in the competitive external markets.
"
6405,"The balance of payments situation shows signs of worsening every year mainly because goods and construction materials have to be imported in increasing volume even at higher prices to sustain the pace of development whereas, the other hand, Nepalese exports have, by and large, stagnated over the year because of their relative costs.
"
6406,"This situation calls for sustained efforts on industrial development only through which the economy can be self-sufficient in production of different commodities and thus substitute imports and for efforts to reduce production and transit cost to significantly boost exports.
"
6407,"Deposit the significant role that the private sector can play in the process of industrial development, it has to be accepted that the potentials of the private sector in establishment and operation of large industries has not been encouraging.
"
6408,"This trend has a limiting effect on the process of industrialization, which still has to depend on the government sector only. Recent indications show that investments of the private sector has somewhat shifted towards industrial ventures from real estates and commerce.
"
6409,"But, even th3en, this shift in investment seems to be concentrated in industries which promise very quick returns and which have a high propensity to use imported raw-materials.
"
6410,"Industries of this type, while providing certain benefits in the short terms, seem to have had only limited role to play in terms of long-term contributions to the process of industrial development, signs of improvement in the process of industrialization can be attributed mainly to the increasing demands of industrial products in the country, extension and expansion of services from financial institutions, gradual expansion of the improvements in transport, power and other facilities, commodity development and to the efforts on skill and entrepreneur development.
"
6411,"Caparison of the results of industrial censuses of 1976/77 and 1981/82 show that the member of industrial units increased from 3528 to 4903, an increase by 72.8 percent.
"
6412,"Likewise, member of person employed has also increased by 64 percent, from 50, 120, to 81,050.
"
6413,"The total value of the products of these industries has also increased from Rs 3940 million to Rs 5920 million.
"
6414,"Review of the Sixth Plan
"
6415,"Through the progress during the plan period in the industrial s ector seems to be generally satisfactory, it cannot be divided that there have been many shortfalls in the specified goals.
"
6416,"Despite the goal to promote 168 industries, it seems that only 57 industries have been promoted even if the estimated for fiscal year 1984/85 is taken into consideration. The goal to establish mineral-based industries under joint-investment program has not yielded any result.
"
6417,"Likewise, hand-over of public sector industries to the private sector has lagged behind.
"
6418,"The contribution of the industrial sector to the gross domestic product still does not show a consistent increase (annex 1).
"
6419,"The contribution of this sector to gross domestic product still hovers around 43 percent, as was the case in fiscal year 1979/80.
"
6420,"In the industrial production front, the picture is, on the whole, satisfactory.
"
6421,"Capacity utilization of the public sector industries, during the period 1980/81 to 1984/85, show an increasing trend.
"
6422,"The average capacity utilization has increased from 56.6 percent in 1980/81 to 66.55 percent in 1984/85.
"
6423,"Capacity utilization of Hetauda Textile Factory has increased from 28.75 percent to 68 percent, Janakpur Cigarette Factory from 58 percent to 90 percent, Birgunj Sugar Factory from 44.90 percent to 73.3 percent, Harisiddhi Brick and Tile Factory from 50.0 percent to 72.5 percent and the capacity utilization of Himal Cement Company increased from 70.7 percent to 83.3 percent.
"
6424,"It seems unlikely that cement production will see significant increased during the Sixth Plan period because: i) Hetauda Cement Factory, which is under construction will produce in small quantities as it is still under trial production, ii) there have been long delays in expansion of production capacity of Himal Cement Factory and iii) there has been hardly any progress in matters relating to establishment of Udayapur Cement Factory.
"
6425,"However, there are strong indicators to suggest that the country is approaching total self-sufficiency in the production of goods and commodities like biscuit, confectionery, laundry soap, vegetable ghee, wheat-flour, polythene pope, cigarette, matches, rubber slipper, noodles, beers, soft-beverages, alcoholic beverages, sugar, currugated-sheet and paints.
"
6426,"Dependence on imports for writing and printing papers still does not show any signs of change.
"
6427,"Regarding production of paper, Bhrikuti Paper Factory is not likely to come into production and even the construction works of the Nepalgunj paper Mill has not yet started. Hence, there is not likelihood of increase in paper production during the plan period.
"
6428,"On the policy-level, there has been some significant progress in the direction of formulating a set of concrete and mutually reinforce policies to encourage industrial development.
"
6429,"Implementation of Industrial Enterprise Act, 1981; Foreign Investment and Technology Act, 1982 and the promulgation of 1983 ordinance show signs that the process of industrial development can be organized and directed towards set goals and objectives.
"
6430,"Progress achieved by N.I.D.C., the only institution involved in extending loans to the private sector for industrial investment, is also not that encouraging.
"
6431,"During the Sixth Plan period it was estimated that this corporation will be extend financial assistance to the private sector to the tune of Rs 502.7 million where as corporation has invested only Rs 204.3 million during the period covering 1980/81 to 1983/84.
"
6432,"Including the estimated investment of Rs80 million in fiscal year 1984/85, the corporation could have invested a total amount of Rs 284.3 million which comes to about 56.5 percent of the target specified by the Sixth Plan.
"
6433,"Short-fall in loan investment during the first four years with yearly investment amounting on an average to only Rs 51 million or 40.6 percent of the targeted amount has been the main reason for this rather unsatisfactory performance.
"
6434,"The fact that implementation of Industrial Enterprises Act, 2038, implementation of the new trade policy introduced in 2039 to promote industrial development and the promulgation of the ordinance of 2040 contributed significantly in boosting-up the export of goods and commodities like leather, carpet and ready-made garments is born out by the increase in export of manufactured goods experience in fiscal years 1983/84 and 1984/85.
"
6435,"Agriculture Tools Factory is extimated to produce agricultural tools and implements equivalent to an amount of Rs36.6 million whereas the original target was to produce and implements worth Rs 45.0 million. In the same way, Agricultural Lime Industry was estimated to produce 10 thousand tons of agricultural lime, 55 thousand tons of chemical lime -stone and 9 thousand tons of miscellaneous construction materials but it has produced an estimated 2.3 thousand metric tons of agricultural lime, 28.4 thousand metric tons of chemical lime -stones and 5.2 metric tons of miscellaneous construction materials. Regarding projects under construction and/or under expansion, works on increasing the production capacity of Himal Cement Factory from 160 metric tons to 400 metric tons daily are still under-way.
"
6436,"Delays in completing the construction of Hetauda Cement Factory which has a production capacity of 750 metric tons per day suggest that the Factory will not be able to produce cement commercially during the plan period through it undertake traial-production in the last four-months of fiscal year 1984/85. Construction works of Bhrikuti Paper Factory with a daily production capacity of 10 tons is expected to be completed by the end of the plan period and, likewise, Nepal Orind Magnetite Industry and Ganesh Himal Lead Industry are also still in construction phase.
"
6437,"In the area of industrial estates, Small industrial Estate in Bhaktapur, Prime-mover Industries Project in Surkhet and Butwal Industrial Estates are still under-construction and preliminary works on the establishment of Industrial estates in Dhankuta, Dhangadi and Rajbiraj have been completed. On the development of industrial raw-materials, Tobacco Development Company was to produce 18 thousand metric tons of tobacco through its extension and promotion services and the Cotton Development Board was to produce 2.3 thousand metric tons of cotton and 5.4 metric tons of cotton-seed under its extension and promotion program and cultivation of cotton was to be undertaken in 7.8 thousand hectares.
"
6438,"Signs of positive changes are indicated in the process of industrial development, in utilization of production, capacity employment generation and in exports during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6439,"However, it can not be denied that certain fundamental aspects of industrial development and its potential contributions to the economy have not received their due and timely consideration. The need to focus due attention and to develop and following aspects are very cogent: 1.
"
6440,"Management, on a well-coordinated and timely basis of delivery of facilities and services provided to entrepreneurs for industrial development by different acts and regulations has not been effectively developed.
"
6441,"2. Efforts to increase productivity of raw-materials produced with in the country, ensure adequate and timely supply of imported raw-materials, provide necessary loans, foreign exchange and other financial assistance and increase the productivity of local labour have not resulted in success to the desire extent.
"
6442,"3. There has been hardly any success in increasing the size of the limited internal market through development of agricultural sector which could increase the income of the majority of population engaged in agriculture.
"
6443,"4. Transport and power facilities, which could provide an added impetus to the process of industrialization, have not been developed in different parts (especially in central and other mountainous) of the country.
"
6444,"6. Effective measure have not been developed to protect industries from the competing with goods that flow in the country because of the open border.
"
6445,"7. Development of manpower, expertise and management capabilities have not yet been undertaken in a planned manner.
"
6446,"Though there were indications of positive change in the last tow years of the plan period, mainly because of implementation and promulgation of certain acts and ordinance, it is not likely that an atmosphere congenial to the healthy growth of industrialization process can be effected without bringing-in significant changes inn the points mentioned above.
"
6447,"In addition to these measures that had to be taken at the government level, the Sixth Plan had also accorded priority to the need to expand the role of the private sector in industrial development.
"
6448,"Financial institutions have cordial role to play in expanding the involvement of the private sector in industrial development. Looked at from this point of view, the present practice of extending credits to 'priority sector' from the commercial banks seems to have facilitated the development of cottage industries.
"
6449,"But N.I.D.C which was established with the basic object of extending assistance in the establishment of medium and large-scale industries, has bot been able to achieve desired results.
"
6450,"However, it has to be admitted that there has been no increase in the capital base of N.I.D.C. commensurate to the needs brought about by the increased attraction of the private sector to industrial ventures and by the increase in project size and outlays
"
6451,"Increase in production of agricultural, forestry and mineral sectors is essential to establish industrial sector as the leading sector of the economy. Growth in these sectors will lead to an improvement in the purchasing capacity of the mass and it is the increase in the purchasing power of the mass that leads to an increase in the demand for industrial products and in the production of raw materials.
"
6452,"Thus, increase in production from agricultural and other sectors are the pre-requisites without which there can be no industrial development.
"
6453,"The fact that a balanced and well-coordinated development of other productive sectors of the economy will greatly facilitate the development of industrial sector is yet to be translated into meaningful practice.
"
6454,"The following objectives, policies and programs have been identified and developed, on the basis of the achievements and experiences of the Sixth Plan, for implementation in the Seventh plan.
"
6455,"Objective
"
6456,"1. From among the non-agricultural sectors, to increase the contribution of the industrial sector to gross domestic production.
"
6457,"2. To expand and expansion and development of cottage industry as a means to increase productive employment opportunities.
"
6458,"3. To emphasize the expansion and development of cottage industry as a means to increase productive employment opportunities.
"
6459,"4. To increase both the production and productivity of certain industrial products to promote exports and to substitute imports.
"
6460,"Policy
"
6461,"1. Industries which have a direct linkage with domestically produced raw-materials and which can contribute positively to the gross domestic productive will be promoted and optimum utilization of production capacity of already established industries will be stressed.
"
6462,"2. System of incentives and other related provisions related to the increased participation of individual entrepreneurs and to attract foreign investments will be reviewed on a regular basis to incorporate necessary changes, if needed.
"
6463,"3. Industrial estates presently run in the government sector will gradually be handed-over to the private sector.
"
6464,"4. Priority will be accorded to promote industries, except for those related to defense production, in the private sector.
"
6465,"5. Necessary protection, but no monopoly rights, will be granted to industries involved in production of goods substitution imports used in daily consumption and of construction materials.
"
6466,"However, due care will also be taken that protections do not result in adverse effects on the consumers.
"
6467,"Working Policy
"
6468,"1. A long-term plan for the development of industrial sector will be formulated and implemented in coordination with the sectoral needs and priorities of other sectors such as agriculture, forest and mining to main overall sectoral consistency and complimentary.
"
6469,"2. Necessary improvements in areas such as strengthening, management and financial resources will be undertaken to facilitate capacity utilization and to achieve greater productivity in industries both in the private and public sectors.
"
6470,"3. Internal competition and other appropriate measure will be undertaken to discourage monopoly practiced which generally affect the consumer adverse.
"
6471,"4. Programs directed as productions of goods to meet the basic needs of the people such as food grains, clothes, construction materials, medicine, teaching materials and at production of small agricultural tools and implements and both small machines to be used in factories to substitute import and to direct the economy towards self-sufficiency will be implemented on a priority basis.
"
6472,"5. The policy to create employment opportunities through expansion of industries will be followed and implemented. Necessary training will be provided to improve the qualitative standard and productivity of the extent layout force.
"
6473,"6. Industries which can substitute imports and this contribute towards self-sufficiency of the economy in the first two and the last three years of Seventh Plan will be identified and promoted on a priority basis.
"
6474,"7. Conforming to the priorities already stated, a list of industries to be promoted in the private sector and their promotion program will be developed.
"
6475,"If the private sector does not come forward to the desired extent, as has been the case in the past, then efforts will be made to promote highly essential industries from among those in the priority list either directly in the public sector or in collaboration with the private sector.
"
6476,"But even then, an outlook to hand -over these industries to the private sector will be maintained.
"
6477,"8. Shares of industries which are operating well at present will be sold and distributed through  to develop industrial finance markets.
"
6478,"Interest of the general public will thus be mobilized towards industrial financing and investment from the private sector gradually promoted.
"
6479,"9. Processes involved in issuing licenses, financial assistance and other services necessary for industrial promotion will be simplified and made less time-consuming and a one-window system will be developed.
"
6480,"The present policy and process of industrial financing, import customs and duties and valuation practices, price control policy, labor policy, sales tax and excise duty will all be reviewed to incorporate timely changes.
"
6481,"One the main reason which has hindered operation of industries in their materials and semi-processed goods. Hence, efforts will be made to implement effective programs to ensure regular and adequate supply of these inputs after an evaluation of present institutional and private arrangements.
"
6482,"A detailed study on the capital base and resource needs of N.I.D.C. will be undertaken and appropriate steps, as suggested by the study, will be initiated. 15.
"
6483,"Especial efforts will be made expand the market and promote exports of industrial products like noodles, soap, vegetable ghee, cigarette, polythene pipe and plastic goods which already show signs of meeting total internal demands.
"
6484,"To further intensify efforts on different activities such as industrial planning, promotion, research, consultancy services, engineering services, entrepreneur development and increase in productivity, Industrial Services Center will be strengthened and transformed to a high-level National Productivity Council so that these activities are run in a campaign-like basis.
"
6485,"The pace of implementation of Small Industry Development Project presently operating in Bagmati and Gandaki Zone will be further improved.
"
6486,"Such programs will be implemented in other districts as well in addition to intensifying the implemented in other districts as well in addition to intensifying the implementation efforts of such components under integrated rural development projects. 19.
"
6487,"To promote exports and to increase foreign-exchange earnings, productivity or following products of small and cottage industries will be raised in addition to their standardization i)  Woolen carpets
"
6488,"ii)  Paper and metal handicrafts
"
6489,"20.
"
6490,"To promote the development of cottage and small-scale industries, a policy will be followed to discourage the establishment of certain industries except at the level of small and cottage industries. 21.
"
6491,"A system whereby information on licenses provided for new industrial ventures and their salient feathers and an up-to-date registration data can be published and provided to the general public and potential investors will be developed. 22.
"
6492,"To further facilitate the process of handling-over the industries in the public sector to the private sector, a set of criteria guiding the handing over process will be changed to private ownership. 23.
"
6493,"Shares and land -ownership of in dustrial estates presently operating will be sold to industries only.
"
6494,"Participation of the private sector will be sought and encouraged in developing land and in construction of sheds - in view industrial estates.
"
6495,"To this effect, new system of management of industrial estates will be developed.

The present capacity utilization of established industries is estimated at 50 percent.
"
6581,"It is estimated that the capacity utilization of industries to be promoted and improvements in capacity utilization of industries presently operating will raise the overall capacity utilization of industries to 70 percent in the Seventh Plan period resulting in an increase by Rs 6980 million in the production of industrial goods in the last year of the plan year of the plan period.
"
6582,"Likewise, with value-added estimated to increase by Rs 1396 million (Twenty percent of the increase in production), industrial production is estimated to grow at 12.7 percent per annum during the plan period.
"
6583,"If gross domestic product continues to grow at the present rate in the Sixth Plan period and if the estimated rate of growth of 4.5 percent is attained in the Seventh Plan, then the contribution of the industrial sector to the gross domestic product will reach 6 percent in the last year of the plan. This will have positive effects on the balance of trade as well.
"
6584,"It is estimated that exports will increase by Rs 3579 million if the estimated increase of Rs 6980 million in industrial production materializes. however, as increase in production of this order is likely to need an import component of Rs 3845 million, net increase in export is estimated as Rs 814 million and net substitution of imports at Rs2291. the level of bigger-scale industries, 28 foot-related, 14 clothes and garments, 10 housing and construction materials related, 10 education materials related and 15 light-engineering industries and 23 export-oriented industries to a total of 123 industries are expected to be promoted. Likewise, at the level of cottage and small- scale industries, a total of 7,500 industries are to be promoted.
"
6585,"In addition to thes e, 36 industries at the bigger scale and 3500 production-related and 7500 service-related cottage and small-scale industries will also be promoted.

"
6587,"COTTAGE INDUSTRY
"
6588,"Taking into consideration the scarcity of capital, technology, skilled manpower and the limit ed internal market in addition to the lack of infrastructural and power facilities, it is not likely that reliance on only large and medium scale industries will lead to industrial development.
"
6589,"On the other hand, development of cottage industry is likely to make significant contributions to the economy as this industry can generate employment in the rural sector, meet the needs of local markets and utilize locally available raw materials to a great extent.
"
6590,"That cottage industry can be developed through the mobilization of domestic resources itself makes it obvious that industrial development and expansion of an economy like ours is possible through the development of cottage industry.
"
6591,"Moreover, given the direct positive effects in increasing the income of the rural mass, this industry has the potential to bring about positive changes in the whole of economy.
"
6592,"Development of proper institutional support to the units scattered all over the country, therefore, is likely to yield benefits both from a short -term and a long-term consideration.
"
6593,"Cottage Industry in the Sixth Plan
"
6594,"It has be accepted the there have been some concrete achievements during the sixth Plan in policy developments and program-action related to cottage industry.
"
6595,"Changes in the rule and regulation pertaining to the establishment of cottage brought about by the implementation of the Industrial Enterprises Act, 1981 B.S. has resulted in significant expansion and diversification of facilities for establishing and operating cottage industries, especially in terms of raw-materials and other inputs.
"
6596,"In all, 13,360 cottage industries were registered during the Sixth Plan period. Of this total registered units, only 584 (or 4.4 percent) units were dependents on imported raw material.
"
6597,"Average per unit production of these units is estimated at Rs 2 million per annum with a total yearly production estimated at Rs 1170 million.
"
6598,"Value-added per unit industry is estimated at 8 million with total value-added from all the unit being estimated at Rs 467 million per year.
"
6599,"These consideration lead to the conclusion that cottage industries have made significant contributions gross domestic product, per capita income and in generation of employment.
"
6600,"During the Sixth Plan period, intensive industry program was implemented in twenty district.
"
6601,"Under this program nine districts in Bagmati and Gandaki Zone where cottage and small industry program and integrated village development program were underway with the assistance of World Bank were also covered.
"
6602,"For the development and expansion of cottage industry, Sixth Plan has specified a target of training 13,170 persons under the general program whereas 15,780 persons were to be trained under the intensive program. Thus, the total number of persons to be trained in different technical and vocational fields was set ant 28,950 persons.
"
6603,"In the area of handicrafts promotion, 300 new designs were to be developed, 60 models prepared research in 15 areas related to handicraft to handicrafts were to be undertaken and fifteen exhibitions organized during the Sixth Plan. 973 different designs have been developed and 00 models prepared whereas research in only for areas were completed and only 12 exhibitions were organized during this period.
"
6604,"A targeted figure of Rs 120 million was to be distributed as loans for the development of cottage and small industries in the private sector. This program was implemented in three districts of  valley and six district of Gandaki Zone with loan assistance from the World Bank. Loans amounting to Rs 66.9 million were approved for 1413 industrial units and an amount of s. 46.4 million was already disbursed by the end of the foruth year of the Plan.
"
6605,"During the plan period, raw materials and implements worth Rs 141.4 million were made available to different industries and goods worth Rs 24.2 million were procured from entrepreneurs engaged in cottage industry. The original target of the plan was to supply raw-materials and other implements worth Rs 60 million and to procure Rs 90 million worth of goods from entrepreneurs.
"
6606,"Likewise, goods worth Rs 170 million were to be produced from different production units operating within the Department of Cottage Industry whereas the actual production of different goods has bee valued at Rs 186.9 million.
"
6607,"The following objectives, policies and programs have been identified by the Seventh Plan for the development and promotic of cottage industry. Objectives
"
6608,"1. To create employment opportunities to check the problems of unemployment and under-employment both in the rural and urban areas and to increase direct incomes in the rural areas.
"
6609,"2. To develop this sector as an important source of foreign exchange earnings through improvements in productivity and quality of the products.
"
6610,"1. In the process of expanding the coverage of intensive cottage industry program to other parts of country as well, small industry development project will also e implemented to cover additional districts.
"
6611,"2. Coverage of intensive banking program will be extended and programs will be developed and implemented through commercial
"
6612,"3. Appropriate curriculum and other bases will be developed to make skill development training program implemented through Cottage industry Department and Cottage Industry Development board more meaningful in the context of the needs of specific districts.
"
6613,"4. Services of cottage industry Handicrafts Sale Emporium will be further expanded to ensure regular supply of raw-materials.
"
6614,"5. Production of exportable products of cottage industry will be further expanded and such products will be standardized by coordinating efforts on production and market-development through agencies involved in export promotion.
"
6615,"6. Supply of adequate credit-facilities, implements and skills will be given especial emphasis to promote tourism- oriented industries based on trade traditional skills and technologies and using local raw-materials.
"
6616,"7. Instead of specifying independent targets for each of the different services, e.g. promotion, consultancy, financial assistance, registration and licensing, supply of raw-materials, designs and market development service required for the promotion and operation of cottage industries, a new process whereby targets are s pecified in a unified and coordinated manner will be developed and implemented.
"
6617,"8. Industrial villages based on local resources, raw materialsss and skills will be established and operated in districts which are still relatively less-developed.
"
6618,"9. Cottage Industry Development Board will implement short -term training program such as skill-development and entrepreneur-development in districts where intensive programs are already underway.
"
6619,"However, in district and areas not covered under the intensive progra m, Department of Cottage Industry will be involved in running training courses.
"
6620,"10. A new project will be formulated and implemented to develop middle level manpower and to fully utilize the infrastructural bases that have already been developed within the Department of Cottage Industry.
"
6621,"Program
"
6622,"Programs for the development of cottage industry in the Seventh Plan have been categorized under three headings namely, general, intensive and promotional. A.
"
6623,"General
"
6624,"All activities and programs to be implemented through Department of Cottage Industry will be implemented under general program.
"
6625,"Activity components such as technical training, industrial services, handicrafts promotion, ready-made garments and hand-made paper project, training for prison inmates, industrial data project and the operation of four regional centers will be included within this program.
"
6626,"1) 	Department of Cottage Industry will organize training programs to create additional manpower at the entrepreneur, artism and mechanical worker's level and to enhance the existing level of knowledge and skills of such manpower. In all, 1340 persons will be trained for a period of two years on general technical subjects, 345 persons will receive advanced training, 210 persons will be trained on hand-made paper, 410 on ready made garments, 4,600 persons will be covered under mobile training and 275 prison-inmates will be trained on vocational subjects.
"
6627,"2) 	For the development and expansion of handicrafts industry 360 designs will be developed out of which 120 models will be prepared and 240 designs will be distributed. In addition, fifteen-research project will be undertaken and ten exhibitions will be organized.
"
6628,"3) 	Likewise, industrial surveys in fifteen new district will be undertaken, reports on thirty district already covered under industrial survey will be published, 500 schemes distributed, technical assistance to 380 industries will be extended, four pilot-projects implemented, five feasibility studies and research on five topics undertaken and 20 pairs and exhibitions will be organized to develop and cottage industries. Under the production program, goods and commodities worth Rs 12.5 million will also be produced.
"
6629,"4) 	Ten statistical profiles will be prepared and 500 industrial units will be observed and checked, 35 seminars and twenty refresher training course will be organized under industrial statistics and administration.
"
6630,"B. Intensive Program
"
6631,"Intensive program for industrial expansion and development will be implemented through Cottage and Small industries Development Board.
"
6632,"This program will cover projects like cottage and small-scale project run under the World Bank assistance and Integrated Rural Development Projects, Industrial Village Project to be run under Swiss assistance in Dolakha and Sindhupalchok districts.
"
6633,"Under these project 5,500 persons will be trained on motivation, entrepreneur develop and management and 9,600 persons will be prepared and distributed, 1380 industrial units will receive technical assistance and raw-materials and implements equivalent to an amount of Rs 15.2 million will be supplied. Sales services will also be provided through direct procurement or products of such industries.
"
6634,"Ceramics project, entrepreneur development program and training for gainful rural activity will be covered and implemented under this program.
"
6635,"This program consists of mobile training under which 4,600 persons will be trained, another training program which will impart training on different skills to 1030 persons in addition to the establishment of a ceramics industry and initiation of related research in this area.
"
6636,"Raw materials and other implements necessary for local cottage and rural industries and sales service for the products of these industries will be provided through Cottage Industry Sales Center and through other institutional mechanisms. In all, thirteen projects in different parts of the country will be implemented under this program.
"
6637,"D. Program Under Decentralization
"
6638,"A total of 75 branch-offices in different districts run under the Department of Cottage and Small-scale Industry will be covered under this program Activities such as identification of industries which can be developed and established on a local basis, selection of trainees and promotion of people's participation in promotion of industries and in skill development training will be carried out under this program. Expenditures
"
6639,"Details on expenditures to be incurred on the development of cottage and small-scale industries during the plan period are presented as follows:
"
6640,"The above figures reflect only the expenditures to be incurred in industries to be promoted the government sector. In addition to his, private sector investment in 18,400 cottage industries including those related with service is estimated at Rs 825.6 million.
"
6641,"If 12 percent of the total loan investment during the plan period can be mobilized for the priority sectors as estimated by Nepal Rastra Bank, then resources to the tune of Rs 950.9 million can possibly the mobilized for the cottage and small-scale industry sector.
"
6642,"CHAPTER 34 TRADE
"
6643,"Introduction Trade occupies a prominent place in economic development of .
"
6644,"Lack of sufficient natural resource and endowments, delay in industrialization, limited market and limited market and limited investment capacity tend to suggest that development process is likely to hitghly time-consuming.
"
6645,"However, this dependence on imports is likely to have adverse effects on the balance of payments and give rise to new challenges. This kind of situation calls for a well- managed and regulated import policy and for a planned drive to increase exports so that the balance of payments situation is in favor of the country.
"
6646,"In this background, only through proper development of the trade and commerce sector will it be possible to increase foreign exchange earnings through increased exports to finance the imports of goods essential for development.
"
6647,"Increase in the size of population and the consequent increase in internal demand have led to domestic consumption of goods which were traditionally exported leading to a situation where export of such traditional goods is no longer possible.
"
6648,"But, on other hand, it does not seems possible to significantly expand the production of new exportable commodities without effecting major transformations, within a short period of time, in the economy dependent inordinately in agriculture.
"
6649,"Thus, in the present context, it has become necessary to increase the production of goods, which were traditionally exported.
"
6650,"However, it will also be possible through increased industrial production, to substitute imports and to effect significant savings in import spending.
"
6651,"This arrangement will also ensure that both agricultural products receive maximum prices. Foreign loans and assistance will certainly increase in the Seventh Plan period as compared as compared to the receipt of these in the Sixth Plan period.
"
6652,"In addition, principals, and interests of loans received in earlier plan periods have also to be repaid. This situation again reinforces the need to increase foreign exchange earnings through increased exports and also signifies the important role of trade and commerce in the overall development of the country.
"
6653,"The geo-physical structure of the country has resulted in a contraction of the internal market whereas the land-locked situation of the country has made it very difficult to export Nepalese goods and commodities in the competitive international markets, especially in the context of absence of proper transit facilities. The need to strengthen and to render the transit system less expensive and to increase the numerical terms the transit facilities presently available.
"
6654,"In addition, to ensuring proper transit right in conformity with the provisions and agreements made by international bodies and under bilateral agreements is equal cogent.
"
6655,"In addition, the transit system has to be linked to the infrastructures created in the country to accelerate the pace of expansion of the national market.
"
6656,"Review of the Sixth Plan
"
6657,"Seen in the background of the fact that the annual rate of growth of exports had remained at 5 percent whereas that of imports was 14 percent during the Fifth Plan period, it has to be recognized that the objectives pursued by the Sixth Plan to reduce this imbalance through increased standardization and through additional financial and monetary incentives to strengthen and stabilize the export sector has yield positive results in terms of diversification gained in the commodity mix of exports and in the composition of trading partners.
"
6658,"Total foreign trade of the country stood at Rs 4630 million in fiscal year 1979/80, which was also the last year covered by the Fifth Plan period, the figure had nearly doubled to a total of Rs 8220 million and it is estimated to further increase to a total of the 9630 million by the end of the plan period.
"
6659,"Thus, it is estimated that the annual rate of growth in foreign trade will be 16.1 percent in current prices during the plan period.
"
6660,"Export earnings of Rs 521 million in base year 1979/80 has increased to Rs 1161 million in fiscal year 1983/84 and is estimated to increase further to Rs 1272 million in fiscal year 1984/85.
"
6661,"Thus, the average annual rate of growth of exports to  is likely to be 30.6 percent.
"
6662,"During the period in consideration, goods such as Jute, goods, solved extraction, dried ginger, ginger, big cardamon and other such goods seems to have found a good export market in India whereas export of items such as rice and raw jute seems to have declined. seems to have accounted for nearly sixty five percent of the total export trade during the period.
"
6663,"A substantial decline has occurred in the export of goods and commodities to oversea countries.
"
6664,"Export to overseas was equivalent to Rs 630 million in fiscal year 1979/80 whereas earnings from this source of exports declined continuously to r3each a total of just Rs 290 million in the third year of the plan. However, some improvements occurred in the fourth year as earnings totaled Rs F543 million.
"
6665,"It is estimated that export earnings from this sources will total Rs 888 million in the fifth year of the plan.
"
6666,"Jute occupied the most prominent place in the list of items exported to oversea countries. However, during the Sixth Plan period, this place has been occupied by woolen carpets.
"
6667,"For example, in fiscal year1983/84 exports of woolen carpets accounted for 48 percent of the total exports overseas.
"
6668,"Some improvements have also occurred in the export of leather and hides.
"
6669,"In addition, goods such as catechu solvent extraction and ready-made garments have also shown strong export possibilities whereas export of items such as big cafdamon, rice, handicrafts, dried-ginger, raw-jute and jute goods to be losing ground.
"
6670,"Recession in international market, protectionist policy adopted by importing nations, keen competition and increasing transit cost have affected very adversely Nepalese exports to overseas countries during the period in consideration.
"
6671,"Likewise, waiving of the dual-exchange rate also seems to have lessened the attraction to engaged in export activities.
"
6672,"An exchange rate based on currency basket was introduced during the midterm of the plan to eliminate this situation.
"
6673,"In addition, the introduction of financial assistance in export of leather and hides, pre-export loan arrangement in addition to the provision to make available, a certain percentage of export earnings to the exporter and improvement and simplification in banking, financial administrative and other procedures favoring export trade as a result of the implementation of the nine-points export program have resulted in positive changes
"
6674,"Looking at the other side of the picture, import have consistently shown an increasing trend and the average annual rate of growth during the first four year of the plan period has been 17.1 percent.
"
6675,"Total imports had increased by 27 percent in fiscal year in 1980/81 as compared to the previous year and had stood at Rs 4428 million whereas the estimated spending on imports in fiscal year 1984/85 is likely to be equivalent to Rs 7470 million and this, is likely to register an increase of 14.7 percent over that of fiscal year 1983/84.
"
6676,"With imports form India totaling Rs 13380 million (45 percent) and imports from overseas totaling Rs 16276 million (55 percent), it is estimated that the total imports bill during the plan period will be equivalent to Rs 29656 million.
"
6677,"The annual rate of growth of imports, from  growing at an annual rate of 13.7 percent and imports from overseas countries growing 20.8 percent.
"
6678,"Imports from  accounted for 51.2 percent of the total imports in fiscal year 1979/80 whereas this share declined to 45 percent in fiscal year 1983/84 suggesting thereby an increasing rate of growth in imports from third countries and a relative decline in the growth of imports from .
"
6679,"Exports to  as a proportion of imports there from was 38 percent whereas the same in the context of overseas countries was just 15.7 in fiscal year 1983/84.
"
6680,"Thus exports seem to be  oriented whereas imports seem to be oriented from overseas.
"
6681,"In the background of increasing demands for imports, balance of trade deficit amounted to Rs 2330 million and to Rs2820 million respectively in the last year of the Fifth and the first year of the Sixth Plan but this deficit nearly doubled to Rs 4810 million in fiscal year 1983/84.
"
6682,"This has resulted in the balance of payments situation being adversely with a gradual decline foreign exchange savings.
"
6683,"The balance of trade deficit is estimated to reach a total of Rs 5310 million in fiscal year 1984.85.
"
6684,"During this plan period, certain changes in the composition and nature of export items have occurred for example, in fiscal year 1980/81, unprocessed and semi-processed goods accounted for 91 percent of the total exports to .
"
6685,"But by fiscal year 1983/84, semi-processed and unprocessed goods accounted for only 39 percent of the total exports to , Likewise, in the same period, share of unprocessed and semi processed goods declined from 33 percent to 2.5 percent of the total exports to overseas .
"
6686,"Foreign trade had to weather a number difficulty during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6687,"Export sector could not achieve the expected level of performance mainly because the basic structures needed to develop the export sector were lacking.
"
6688,"Export earnings declined substantially during the period in consideration mainly because of the recession in international market and the black of markets for primary products. In addition, there were only a few finished exportable commodities.
"
6689,"On the other hand, increase in prices of construction materials, petroleum products, chemical fertilizer and other such commodities essential for development programs exerted upward pressure in imports. This state of affairs foreshadows a situation in future whereby imports of not only construction goods but even if items needed for daily consumption will have to be controlled if foreign assistance can not be mobilized to the needed extent.
"
6690,"The progress of programs determined for the Sixth Plan period in the commerce and supply sector is briefly summarized in the following paragraphes.
"
6691,"This center studied the process involved from production to export of commodities such as carpets, big cardamon, tobacco, pulses, solvent oil, ready-made garments (cotton) and handicrafts and has prepared an export plan for these commodities during the first four years of the Plan period.
"
6692,"Likewise, a program to develop four exportable items, namely, dried ginger, catechu, vegetable seeds and paper products has also been prepared during the same period.
"
6693,"Furthermore, it is estimated that there will be fifty seven participation in international trade fairs during the plan period either of this center or of the private sector.
"
6694,"This center also undertook outside study of market for four oversea countries, prepared254 company profiles of exporters in addition to collection 54 projects profiles and prepared a directory of foreign importers in the first four years of the plan.
"
6695,"2. Transit and Godown Company Limited:
"
6696,"This company had targeted at the construction of a loading and unloading platform at  port during the plan period which, however, is likely to remain unattained.
"
6697,"A godown with 2,000 metric ton capacity has been constructed at the railway head of Raxaul and another godown in the premises of customs at Birgunj is under construction.
"
6698,"In addition, land has been taken in lease for construction of a godown in Haldia port in  and the establishment of a transit information service center has also been completed.
"
6699,"3. National Trading Limited:
"
6700,"This institution is estimated to import foods and commodities equivalent to Rs 679.4 million during the plan period in addition, to undertake construction of godowns at Prokhara with a 2,000 MT capacity, at Nepalgunj with 7,000 MT capacity and Birgunj and at Tribhuvan Airport in Kathmandu with a capacity of 4,000 MT each to a total capacity of 17,000 metric tons.
"
6701,"An office building with a staff quarter and a show room in Pokhara is also expected to see the completion of construction works.
"
6702,"4. Jute Development and Trade Corporation:
"
6703,"During the Plan period, this corporation is likely to complete 60 percent of the construction works of the research center building, produce 905 MT. of improved variety jute seeds and 199 thousand mt. of jute forms, sale 784 MT. of improved seeds and exported 123 thousand MT. of jute in addition to completed the construction woks on seed -processing godown.
"
6704,"5. Nepal Oil Corporation:
"
6705,"This corporation is expected to complete construction works of 43 fuel storage tanks to a total capacity of 949 K.L. in Biratnagar, Kathmandu, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj in addition, to these at Dhangadi and Amlekhgunj which were yet to be completed by the end of the Fifth Plan period. The corporation is also expected to complete the construction of pipe-line, pump-house, tank-lorry sheds and state water tank and other requisite works.
"
6706,"In addition, the corporation is expected to import petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, bitumin and other like products to an estimated total of 6,29,521 M.T. during the plan period.
"
6707,"6. Cottage Industry Exports Development Project:
"
6708,"Implemented since fiscal year 1982/83 this project has entered into work-service agreements with five private sector entrepreneurs to produce woolen and cotton textiles for export in Kaski, Syanja, and Gorkha districts of Gandaki Zone in addition into run training programs on production of woolen products, established a sales promotion officer under the name of ""Production of Nepal"" in  and arranged for sales promotion and observation tour in  and Asian countries for two teams of exporters.
"
6709,"7. Salt Trading Corporation Ltd.
"
6710,"This corporation is estimated to supply 3,81,211 M.T. of salt and 1,02,921 M.T. of sugar during the plan n period.
"
6711,"The above considerations suggest that though the targets specified for the export sector net and though the foreign exchange earnings from the sector has been increasing in current prices it has to be admitted that net earnings have not increased compared to the earnings have not increased compared to the earnings in the base year.
"
6712,"Increasing imports from third countries and the big gap between exports and imports have erodeal the positive contributions from increased foreign exchange earnings from export as a consequence of the revaluation of U.S. dollars.
"
6713,"Expansion of development progra ms on the one hand and delays in the process of industrialization which could lead to the economy towards self-sufficiency on the other call for a concentration of efforts to reduce the excessive dependence on imports which characteristics the present situation. To reduce the excessive dependence on imports which characteristics the present situation.
"
6714,"To reduce the excession dependence on imports it has become necessary to increase the pace of industrialization to substitute imports, and to develop and expand the export sector to provide foreign exchange earnings for imports of essential commodities.
"
6715,"The new trends, observed during the Sixth Plan period, characterizing exports to be  oriented whereas imports tend to originate from the third country can not be accepted as sign of healthy development in the foreign trade sector.
"
6716,"Increase exports to  will indeed help reduce the deficit in Indian currency holdings but this will not help finance the increasing imports bills which have to be paid U.S. dollars.
"
6717,"To change this situation, the structure of foreign trade has to be changed to favor greater imports from India or export trade has to be expanded to be diversified both on a country wise and commodity-wise basis to intimate the adverse effects on balance of payments situation.
"
6718,"Transit costs and transit facilities also play a very significant role in the smooth and free conduct of import and export trades.
"
6719,"The country still has to face many of the problems arising from the land-locked situation of the country as the program implemented with a view to reduce transport costs and to make the transit systems more efficient during the Sixth Plan have not yielded the expected benefits.
"
6720,"However, during the plan period many developments on an institutional basis have been made in addition to the completion of different studies in this area which should pave the way foe a more efficient transit system in future.
"
6721,"These achievements have to be focused on furthering effort, to ensure the rights to transit facilities and to reduce transit cost to make Nepalese exports more competitive
"
6722,"Objective
"
6723,"1. To gradually make the balance of payment situation more favorable through expansion and development of the export sector.
"
6724,"2. To go on creating necessary infrastructures to make the imports of goods and commodities essential for national development more smooth and well managed.
"
6725,"3. To maximize the benefits of foreign trade to the national economy by making the transit system more efficient and less-expensive.
"
6726,"Policy 1. A plan will be formulated and implemented in a coordinated manpower to expand the export sector through increase in domestic production and through standarization of the produced goods and commodities.
"
6727,"2. A process to diversify and expand export trade will be initiated on the basis of periodic evaluation of emerging trends.
"
6728,"3. 	necessary steps will be taken to ensure proper use of the facilities provide under bilateral and multilateral agreements to make export sector more responsible to the needs of the nation
"
6729,"4. The role of the private sector will be expanded in the export sector and safe-gurads will be provided to the interests of the private sector involved in export activities with out prejudice to the national interest.
"
6730,"5. Necessary amendments will be incorporated in the present acts, rules and regulations governing export trade on the basis of periodic review of such acts, rule and regulations.
"
6731,"6. Protection necessary for the establishment and operation of industries geared towards expansion of exports of towards achieving self-sufficiency will granted through the instrument of appropriate trade policies.
"
6732,"7. Imports priority will be accorded to goods and commodities essential for national development and for daily consumption where imports of other goods and commodities will be discouraged.
"
6733,"8. Necessary improvements will be introduced in the present system of appointment evaluation and incentives to improve the performance and expertise of the public corporations involved in import trade.
"
6734,"9. The structure of import trade will be changed both on a commodity-wise and county and country-wise as may be required in conformity with the trends identified in the balance of payments situation.
"
6735,"With a view to reduce transit cost, new transit facilities will be introduced in addition to the existing areas. 11.
"
6736,"Institutions involved in the management of transit facilities will be further strengthened and made more efficient.
"
6737,"1. Efforts will be focused on formulating and implementing an integrated five years plan to increase the production, productivity, quality and volume of exports of industrial and agricultural goods and commodities which are presently exported or which show promises for export to neighboring countries or to third countries on a selective basis.
"
6738,"2. There will be no restrictions on the free movements within the country of goods and commodities identified for promotion of expert and either the price nor the quantity of such exportable commodities will be controlled or restricted.
"
6739,"3. An effective system to resolve problems related to production. Productivity, quality and exports of goods and commodities identified in the course of periodic reviews will be developed and implemented.
"
6740,"4. A system will be devised whereby exporters automatically receive the concession and facilities provided for expanding and promoting export trade.

"
6762,"Chapter 35
"
6763,"TOURISM
"
6764,"Inroduction
"
6765,"The contributions of the tourism sector in the overall national development have been quite significant.
"
6766,"Specially, this sector has contributed significantly in the balance of payments situation through foreign exchange earning and in the creation of employment opportunities. is endowed with unique cultural traditions, majestic panoramic scenes and with the highest snow-capped mountains which do not fail to tempt and challenge the courageous ones.
"
6767,"The need of the day is to develop tourism sector not only as a medium of foreign-exchange earnings but also as a catalact which can contribute positively to the whole development process.
"
6768,"The number of visitors increased by only 0.4 percent and by 0.8 percent respectively in the first and second years of the Sixth Plan period whereas there was an encouraging increase by 8.5 percent in the number of tourists visiting  in the third year.
"
6769,"Data on the number of tourist arrival suggest that a total number of 6,79,420 tourists visited  in the first four year of the Sixth Plan period. The average rate of increase during the first four years of the Fifth Plan was 15 percent whereas the rate of increase has declined to only 3 percent during the same period of the Sixth Plan.
"
6770,"Of the total number of tourists who visited Nepal in the last year of the Fifth Plan period (1979), 12.04 percent came from North America, 1.1 percent from Central and South America, 42.0 percent from West Europe, 10 percent from East Europe, 0.20 percent from Africa, 36.50 percent from Asia, 5.7 pecent from Australia and the Pacific and 0.10 percent came very areas during the first four years of the Sixth Plan (up to 1983) suggest a slight incre ase for almost all the sources, the trend of yearly increase, by that except for Asia (in which the majority is from India). Europe occupies  was 43.2 percent of the total tourist arrivals whereas arrivals from over five percent.
"
6771,"Taking this fact into consideration, there still seem to be a number of possibilities in increasing the duration of stay of tourists.
"
6772,"Earnings from their source can also be significant by increased if tourist facilities could be extended to other areas of the country as well.
"
6773,"That mountaineering is also an attractive area for promotion of tourism is substantiated by the number of applications received for moujtaineering permits to scale the major peaks of Nepal.
"
6774,"Of the 1310 peaks higher than 6000 metres, Nepal has opened 115 peaks to mountaineering expeditions.
"
6775,"During theSixth Plan period (from autumn 1980 to 1985 spring) there were 411 mountaineering expeditions and it is estimated that these expeditions generated empllyment opportunities for about 2000 persons engaged in climbing.
"
6776,"Royalty from these expeditions totalled Rs 6,001,549 whereas these expeditions are estimated to have spent Rs 83,450,962 in their stay in Nepal.
"
6777,"In addition, those teams also paid a premium of Rs 2,076,838 on insurance of Nepalese climbers.
"
6778,"Thus, a total income of Rs 91,529,349 equivalent of foreign exchange is estimated to have accrued to Nepal from mountaineering expeditions during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6779,"The number of hotel-beds in Kathmandu in 1979 totalled 4925 which have registered an increase of 38.45 percent to reach a total of 6819 in 1983.
"
6780,"The occupancy rates, based on 1983 figures, came to 32.9 percent in the hotels of Kathmandu whereas it was only 28.9 percent for hotels outside Kathmandu. The average duration of stay of tourists in hotels was rather low with only 2.6 nithts per tourist.
"
6781,"For example, of the total numhber of 162,279 tourists who visited Nepal in 1979, 79 percent listed entertainment as the purpose of their visit. In 1983, 73.8 percent of the tourists also listed entertainment as the main purpose of their visit.
"
6782,"Of the total number of tourists visiting Nepal in 1979, 60 percent were male and 40 percent female.
"
6783,"Looking at the age composition of these tourists, we find that 36.2 percent belonged to the 16 to 30 year age-groups and 29.8 percent belonged to the 31 to 45 year age group.
"
6784,"In 1983, the percentage of tourists in 16 to 30 age-group was 23.8 with those in 31 to 45 age-group being 31.5 percent. Thus, the number of tourists on the younger age-group seems to be on the decline.
"
6785,"The implications of these decline on foreign exchange earnings perhaps merit deeper probings.
"
6786,"The total number of tourists visiting Nepal in the first six months 1984 was 91,233 which reflected an increase of 9.1 percent compared to the figures for the same period in 1983.
"
6787,"Of the total number of visitors in the first half of 1984, 9,320 were of American origin, 6930 were British, 7691 French, 4790 German and 3650 were from japan.
"
6788,"Foreign exchange earnings from tourism sector in fiscal year 1983/84 totalled an equivalent of Rs 586 million.
"
6789,"Foreign exchange earnings from tourism sector was an equivalent of Rs 617 million in fiscal year 1980/81 and equivalent of Rs 494 million in fiscal year 1981/82.

"
6872,"LABOUR
"
6873,"Introduction
"
6874,"An increase in per capita productivity with positive effects on the gross domestic product is possible only if the problems related to unemployment and underemployment can be fully tackled.
"
6875,"The unemployment situation does not present a really discouraging picture as only 5.62 percent of the labour force is estimated to be openly unemployed.
"
6876,"However, data on underemployment present an alarming picture as 63.7 percent of the labour force in rural areas and 44.7 percent of the labour force in urban areas are underemployed.
"
6877,"With annual growth rate of 2.66 percent during the 1971-81 decade, there has been an excessive increase in the size of the population with consequent effects on the size of the labour force.
"
6878,"During the decade, the number of those reaching the age bracket of economically active labour force increased by 51.05 in the hilly region and by 38.60 percent in the Terai region.
"
6879,"The labour force is estimated to grow by about 0.2 million persons per year, calculated on the basis of this rate of growth of the total population. The rate of increase, on the basis of the result of 1981 census is estimated at 1.36 percent in the mountainous region.
"
6880,"These figures suggest that as compared to the mountainous region, population pressure on the limited arable  is increasing whereas this pressure (which was rather high) seems to be gradually easing out in the mountainous region.
"
6881,"The easing of population pressure in the mountains could also be interpreted to indicate increased migration the Terai.
"
6882,"It can be accepted that a natural outcome of the relatively high level and pace of infrastructural development in Terai has been an increase in the pace of urbanization.
"
6883,"Increasing urbanization and migration have led to a growing concentration of population in the Terai area with significant increase in the size of the labour force which can not be fully mopped-up by the employment opportunities created thereby ongoing development works thereby suggesting that the pro blem of unemployment and underemployment are not getting any better even in this region whereas in the hilly region, given the relatively limited level of ongoing development activities and given the lack of the significant positive changes in the agricultural and non agricultural sectors, the unemployment and underemployment problems are getting worse. In the mountain areas, these problems can be assumed to be more acute as opportunity for gainful activities is limited to the monsoon season only.
"
6884,"However, it can be assumed that a large segment of the labour remains idle in this area due to the shortage of employment opportunities.
"
6885,"Thus, looking at the problem from a national perspective, it has to be accepted that the problems of unemployment and underemployment are pervasive in all regions and areas of the country.
"
6886,"The Sixth Plan had accorded ""increase in productive employment opportunities"" a prominent place in its objective essentially to emphasis the need to balance increase in employment opportunities with the increase inn labour force and to counter-act the negative effects of an idle labour force on the national economy.
"
6887,"Labour force in the 55-59 years cohort shows the least increase whereas the 20-24 years age-cohort shows an increase of 48 percent. There is a maximum concentration of the labour force in the 20-29 years age cohort.
"
6888,"Moreover, efforts to ease the excessive pressure of this labor force from agriculture to others sectors of the economy have net only with limited success during the decade under reference.
"
6889,"Only 3 percent of the population has shifted from agriculture to non agriculture sectors in 1981 as compared to 1971.
"
6890,"Though the increase in the number of persons employed under services sector has shown an encouraging increase of 10.7 percent, the gap between creation of employment opportunities and the rate of increase in labour force does not, however, show any signs of being bridge up, resulting in a situation full of challenges.
"
6891,"If there is a big shortage of employment opportunities in the rural areas, there is also a shortage of labour with necessary skills and qualities in the urban areas. Thirteen studies (of Jhapa, Biratnager, Dharan, Janakpur, Birgunj, Pokhara, Siddharthanagar, Dang, Surkhet, Darchula, Baitadi Illam and of Kathmandu) undertaken by the Department of Labour on certain aspects of the labour market suggst that demand for labour of these markets came to combined total of 48,438 persons whereas the actually supply was only 32,512 persons leaving, thereby, an unmet demand of 15,876 laborers.
"
6892,"With the above considerations in background, efforts to generate increased opportunities for productive employment have to be based on the following two strategies: - to increase investment in projects likely to have a direct impact in easing the unemployment and underemployment problems, and - 	to imp rove the quality and skills of indigenous labour force
"
6893,"In the context o increasing investment, concerned agencies and institutions have to initiate efforts in this direction after taking stock of different aspect of the economy.
"
6894,"Though efforts in this direction have to be made through a coordinated institutional approach, it would not be out of context to reiterate the fact that there can be no significant increase in the creation of employment opportunities in investments to increase production in both the agricultural and non agricultural sectors are not forthcoming.
"
6895,"On the other hand, efforts to improve quality and skills of labour, available within the country but remaining idle, in conformity with the demands of the labour market are also likely to pay high dividends.
"
6896,"The Department of Labour, within the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, is present by engaged in this area.
"
6897,"In addition to other considerations, labour has significant role to play in maintaining a peaceful working atmosphere in the industrial sector conductive to increased investment and production.
"
6898,"It is equally important to protect the interest of the labour and to maintain working discipline as it is to ensure that adverse developments do not disrupt the production.
"
6899,"It is in this contest that His Majes ty's Government has undertaken the responsibility of fixing minimum wages level of the industrial workers.
"
6900,"The following changes in the minimum wages levels were effected by the government during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6901,"Fixing minimum wage level has a salutory effect on the maintenance of peaceful working conditions though it has to be admitted that the diverse nature of different industries, their production characteristics and ownership patterns make it difficult to treat all workers as a homogenous group and provide equal benefits.
"
6902,"Minimum wage level have to be fixed in a way which does not have any adverse effects on the industries but in the meantime takes into consideration the welfare of the workers.
"
6903,"Thus, a policy whereby the minimum wage level supplements and encourages investment and productivity and takes into consideration the welfare of the laborers as well will be followed during the Seventh Plan period.
"
6904,"Looking from the demand side, there seems to be an acute shortage of semi-skilled and skilled labour in the Mid-western and the Far-western development regions whereas a surplus is limited to some districts, which have easy access and are relatively developed in the Central development region.
"
6905,"The private sector also can play a meaningful role in increasing the mobility of labour and in implementing projects, which encourage this mobility to improve up on the present situation.
"
6906,"The Seventh Plan has taken this consideration in full account.
"
6907,"Review of the Sixth Plan
"
6908,"Plan period.
"
6909,"Eight Labour supply Center (Table 2) some of which have been in operation from earli3er plan period with the objective of improving the quality and skills of domestic labour, were to run training programs on carpentry, masonry, press composition, boiler operation, brick-laying, knitting, cutting and tailoring and were to train a total of 17 thousand persons on these subjects during the plan period, of these eight, Labour supply Center had imparted training on different subjects to 4020 persons during the first four years of the plan period and are likely to train an additional number of 925 persons during the last year of the plan.
"
6910,"The Sixth Plan had also specified a target of holdings three seminars on population education in the organized sector and running of thirty-six motivation and intensive trainings. Only one seminar was organized where sixty-nine motivation and intensive trainings were run.
"
6911,"Only three additional labour supply centres in Jhapa, Itahari and Dhangadhi were established vis -à -vis the target of establishing five centers during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6912,"The total number of Labour supply Centers has now reached six as three center in Hetauda, Nepalgunj and Butwal were already established during the Fifth Plan period.
"
6913,"Objectives
"
6914,"1. To enhance quality and level of skills of labour with a view to mobilize, to the maximum possible extent, domestic labour and to raise the level of national productivity.
"
6915,"2. To strengthen and make more efficient the programs related to employment generation, both at the domestic and foreign level, on the basis of appropriate studies to generate greater employment opportunities and to resolve unemployment related problems.
"
6916,"3. To ma ke more effective the systems related labour welfare in conformity with the welfare needs of the labour.
"
6917,"4. To involve, to the maximum possible extent, Nepali labour in employment opportunities created by development efforts. Policies
"
6918,"1. The level of skills of labour will further be enhanced and necessary industrial and vocational training will be imparted to the members of idle rural labour force with the aim to mobilize ad supply labour to the non agricultural sector as per its needs.
"
6919,"2. Legal provis ions will be developed and made more effective so as to make it obligatory for industrial concerns to utilize domestic labour to the maximum possible extent.
"
6920,"In addition to this, apprentice training for Nepali citizens will also be made compulsory in industrial concerns where non citizens are presently engaged with a view to make more effective the programs directed at replacement of non citizen labour.
"
6921,"3. Programs on employment research and promotion will be further strengthened and implemented.
"
6922,"4. Labour exchange service will be extended and developed on an institutional setting and legal provisions necessary to this land will be devised and developed.
"
6923,"5. Private sector will be encouraged to develop an institutional mechanism to facilitate inter-sectoral mobility of labour.
"
6924,"Working Policy
"
6925,"1. A system hereby the management of an undertaking in the organized sector which employs hundred or more semi-skilled laborers will itself have to appoint a labour welfare officer will be implemented to safeguard the welfare of the laborers.
"
6926,"2. With the Industrial Training Act already effective, greater efforts will be directed at making the apprenticeship -training program in industrial ventures more effective.
"
6927,"10. Ministry of Labour Social Welfare will collect relevant information and arrange to run local training programs in areas where big projects are to be constructed and run by the government.
"
6928,"11.
"
6929,"A well-planned program will be implemented in a few selected industrial venturues to fully replace the non- citizen labour.
"
6930,"Skill-development training will be organized more widely and intensively as a component of this program.
"
6931,"Program
"
6932,"1. Labour Supply Centers
"
6933,"A. Current Projects
"
6934,"Labour supply Centers located in Jhapa, Itahari, Hetauda, Butwal, Nepalgunj and in Dhangadhi have been operating for a considerable period of time essentially to strengthen and expand the labour supply system and to enhance the productivity of labour through appropriate at site trainings.
"
6935,"Program in this area aims at a further broadening of the areas of activity of these centers to train 4740 persons including 650 women on subjects like cutting, knitting, tailoring, carpentry, press composition, masonry, machine-operation, milling, biri-making, apprenticeship, boiler operation, textile mechanics, tyring, wring, spinning, stone cutting and so on during the plan period. These centers, it is also envisaged, will undertake skill-surveys of 100 Panchayats.
"
6936,"2. Industrial and Vocational Training Program
"
6937,"A one-year training program for 300 trainers on subjects like fitting, lathe-operation, milling, welding, machine repair, wiring and electric installation, metal work and pipe fitting is expected to be implemented to enhance the skills of labour by the Vocational Training Center at Rani in Biratnagar.
"
6938,"The Vocational Training Project, located at , has a program to train 200 persons including 150 women on hair dressing the plan period.
"
6939,"3. Employment Research and
"
6940,"Established in the Sixth Plan period with the objective of undertaking research and developing policies on issues related to the development of productive labour force in an organized manner, this center has a program to further intensify and strengthen search project, to develop occupational classification of labour involved in industrial and development works in three sectors, prepare job inventory of one sector and to prepare ten pilot scheme, five manpower manuals and reports on the labour market of five sectors, namely, of transport, construction, mining, commercial enterprise and of tea garden.
"
6941,"4. Foreign Employment Service
"
6942,"Foreign employment service will be implemented in an organized manner and this program will have components such as collection of information on those workers who have migrated to foreign countries for seeking employment opportunities and those who are already in foreign countries with a view to safeguard their interest and welfare and development of manpower in conformity with the needs of foreign labour markets.
"
6943,"5. Labour Exchange Services
"
6944,"There a very cogent need to establish a training Center which can organize refreshers' training for trainers, who in the absence of such opportunity, tend to teach only what they have learnt during their own training and tend to be oblivious to the latest theoretical and practical additions.
"
6945,"The development of hydro-electricity was emphasized right from the beginning of planned development endeavors in view of the high potential of generating power from the massive water resource of the country and in view of the fact that other sources of energy like fossil fuel, coal or gas deposits were not yet identified.
"
6946,"Diesel plants for generating power have been developed, as a matter of fact, only as a short-term increase designed to meet the shortage of power.
"
6947,"In fiscal year 1979/80, that is the last year of the Fifth Plan, power generated for public distribution totalled 68,346 k.w., of which 52,588 k.w. was hydro-electric power and diesel power was 15,758 k.w., whereas in fiscal year 1955/56, that is before the First Plan, was launched, total installed generating capacity of the country was 6,280 k.w. with, 2,077 k.w. being hydro electric power and 4,023 k.w. being diesel power.
"
6948,"It is further estimated that the total installed capacity will reach 1,55,941 k.w. of which 1,29,509 will be generated power and 26,432 k.w. diesel generated power by the end of this Sixth Plan.
"
6949,"Thus, though the power generation, especially Hydro-electric power generation capacity of the country has increased substantially, it has to be admitted that the achievement in this area has always lagged for behind the power generation targets specified by the periodic plans.
"
6950,"The percentage achievements from the First to the Sixth Plans against the specified targets were respectively: 4.8, 13.8, 33.7, 70.3, 31.8 and 60.5 percent.
"
6951,"Looking at the supply situation of power, in inability to increase the supply at the same time rate at which the demand for it was growing was affecting adversely the developments of the industrial, agricultural, commercial and domestic sectors even by the end of the Fifth Plan.
"
6952,"The shortage of power had further worsened in the first two years of the Sixth Plan.
"
6953,"Since the third year of the plan period, when 60,000 k.w. of power was generated from Kulekhani Hydro-Electric Project and added to the sources of supply, the situation has much improved.
"
6954,"But now, it has also been noted that as the demand for power supply did not increase at the expected rate, more than 50 percent of the generating capacity of Kulekhani Hydro-Electric Project remains unutilized.
"
6955,"In the second year of this plan period, that is fiscal year 1986/87 Kulekhani II Hydro -Electric Project (32,000 k.w. )will be completed as will the Marsyandi Hydro-Electric Project (66,000 k.w.) by fiscal year 1988/89) or the fourth year of the Plan.
"
6956,"In the area of extension of power supply, only 41 districts have received power supply services so far whereas the 34 mountainous districts are yet to received the supply to the rural areas for the economic development of these areas in addition, to the rural areas for the economic development of these areas in addition, to strengthening and widening the coverage of the electricity services even in areas which presently are receiving these facilities.
"
6957,"It is in cognizance of all these facts and figures that the Seventh Plan has aimed at the development of the power sector.
"
6958,"Review of the Sixth Plan
"
6959,"The Sixth Plan had specified a target of generating 1,24,000 k.w. from big-hydro -electricity projects 5,833 k.w. from small hydel projects and 15,000 k.w. from diesel plants to a total additional generating capacity of 1,44,923.
"
6960,"However, the total increase in generating capacity was only 86,045 k.w. during the plan period. Of this increase, big hydro -electricity projects like Kulekhani and Devighat accounted respectively for 60,000 k.w. and 14,100 k.w. while eight small hydel plants accounted for 1271 k.w. and in the area of diesel generated power, Hetauda Diesel Plant accounted for 10,000 k.w. and other small diesel plants for 674 k.w.
"
6961,"By the end of this fiscal year (i.e. 1984/85) as additional supply of 1,500 k.w. is expected to be generated from Pokhara water utilization project and as one more small hydel project is expected to be completed, the progress in the area of generating additional power supply during the Sixth Plan will be 87,595 k.w.
"
6962,"In comparison to the specified target, this progress is only 60.4 percent of the target.
"
6963,"In the area of construction of transmission lines, a total of 238 km of extension lines is expected to be completed including the already constructed 90 km of 132 kv line and 38 km of 66 kv line and 110 km of 33 kv line which expected to be completed by the end of the fiscal year.
"
6964,"Thus, the actual progress comes to only 18 percent of the specified target. The 132 kv transmission line between Hetauda-Butwal, Butwal-Nepalgunj and Dumkebas -Dumre to a total 526 km and 33 kv transmission line from Dharan-Dhankuta, Trishuli-Dhunche-Somdang, Kharidhunga-Charikot and Ghorahi- Tulsipur to a total of 135 km, to a grand total of 671 km will remain under construction.
"
6965,"The progress in the construction of transmission lines between Hetauda-Biratnagar and Dumkebas-Butwal is expected to have reached around 90 percent. In the area of strengthening power supply system, works on both the first and second phase have been already completed in Kathmandu, while the first and second phase have been already completed in Kathmandu, while the first-phase strengthening program in Biratnagar is expected to be completed by the end of the plan period.
"
6966,"Extension of electricity services in the existing and new supply centers are being continued.
"
6967,"Pre-feasibility studies of Kali Gandaki II (4,80,000 kw), Budi Gandaki (6,00,000 kw) and Seti West (1,05,000 kw) and the economic and technical feasiblilty studies of Koshi river basin master plan, Mulghat Hydro-Electricit y Project (68,000 kw) and Sapta Gandaki Hydro -Electricity project (2,25,000 kw) have been completed during the Sixth Plan period.
"
6968,"However, there has been no progress in the completion of feasibility studies on a project identified as the most appropriate from the study on Koshi river basin master plan and on Rapti and Bagmati rivers as were specified by the Sixth Plan.
"
6969,"Impediments, Hindrances and Problems
"
6970,"Both external and internal factors have been identified as being responsible for the big gap between specified targets and actual achievements.
"
6971,"The following are the main problems and hindrances encountered in the course of implementation of programs
"
6972,"a) 	Most of the power projects have to rely on one or more than one source(s) of bilateral and/or multilateral financing. As a consequence, the delays in financing and procedural arrangements have adversely effected the implementation of these projects.
"
6973,"b) 	Lack of capable contractors has led to delays in works and to supply of inferior goods and services to the projects. Efforts will be designed and developed to pre-empt the occurrence of the same problems during the Seventh Plan period.
"
6974,"A system designed to activate the concerned agencies involved in the implementation of projects to be executed with foreign assistance in finalizing negotiations and other necessary arrangements to eliminate different proceductal delays will be developed.
"
6975,"Likewise, arrangements to the effect that works-contracts are finalized only after the identification and selection of the right and capable contractors will also be developed.
"
6976,"In order to achieve a satisfactory rate of progress in the Seventh Plan period, especial emphasis will be occurred to enhance both the technical expertise and the implementation capacity.
"
6977,"In addition to above mentioned problem, a number of difficulties arising from the following factors were also encountered in the course of implementation:
"
6978,"a) 	Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies of projects sufficient in numbers and different in kinds (eg those based on run -of -the and/or reservoir) have to be completed so that there is a large enough so that there is a large enough choice to choose from at th3e implementation stage and so that power can be generated at relatively cheap costs.
"
6979,"b) 	Transmission and distribution networks have to taken as an integral component of power-general projects and feasibility studies have to design to take the whole into consideration.
"
6980,"On the basis of these experiences, implementation of programs in the power sector will be based on more realistic, practical and appropriate considerations.
"
6981,"Projection of Demand
"
6982,"The Peak demand for fiscal year 1983/84 was calculated at 1,31,760 kw by the Fifth Plan and at 1,93,000 kw by the Sixth Plan.
"
6983,"In comparison to this projection, the peak-demand reached 76,000 kw in areas cover by the unified electricity system and 16,000 kw in other areas to total of 92,000 kw in fiscal year 1983/84.
"
6984,"Total hydropower generating capacity in the central unified system has reached 1,25,986 kw, but the utilization has been only 60 percent of this generating capacity.
"
6985,"Good return from projects can be expected if the projected demand for power-supply prove to be realistic.
"
6986,"This in itself, signifies the need to base projections on realistic considerations.
"
6987,"If the projections prove to base on highly conservative estimates then a shortage situation might emerge leading to shortage of power supply needed for different productive sectors and to adverse effects on economic development efforts whereas a very high projection might lead to misallocation of resources and again to negative effects on the economy.
"
6988,"These consideration again reinforce the need to make projection as realistic as possible. Projecting accurately the demand for electricity is indeed a difficult proposition.
"
6989,"It is desirable to up-date the projections on a regular basis especially in view of the complications involved in, and the importance of these projections.
"
6990,"New projections on the demand of electricity is presented in appendix 1.
"
6991,"Whereas the graph representing projections on demand and supply of electric power presented in appendix 2.
"
6992,"The practice of updating these projections will be continued during this plan period. On the basis of these projections, the demand for electric energy will increase at an annual rate of 13.9 percent and the peak demand for electricity power will increase by 13.6 percent during the Seventh Plan period (1985/90).
"
6993,"In the fiscal year 1984/85 which was the last year covered by the Sixth Plan, demand for electric energy and for electric power was respectively 492.2 gegawatt/hour and 115.6 megawatt whereas the present whereas the present projections suggest these to reach 943.4 gegawatt/hour and 218.9 megawatt by fiscal year 1989/90 which is the last year covered by the Se venth Plan.
"
6994,"Steps Needed to Increase Power Consumption
"
6995,"Though the increase in power consumption indicate an increase in the pace of economic activities and the supply electricity facilities to a greater number of the population, it has become necessary to devote attention to the measures which can lead to an increase in the demand for electricity, especially in view of the fact that there was significant shortfall in the actual demand for electricity in comparison to the projected estimates even though the power generating capacity was there in the country.
"
6996,"However, the following factors seen to be responsible for slowing down the target of increase in the demand for power supply.
"
6997,"a) 	Inadequate expansion of the transmission and distribution lines,
"
6998,"b) 	Lack of expected increase in demand for power in productive sectors especially in sectors such as industry, agriculture, tourism, transport and others; and,
"
6999,"c) 	Increase in electricity tariff rate with the rate being fixed at a level, which discourages increase in power consumption. Thus, in this situation, the following steps are necessary to increase the demand for electric power.
"
7000,"Produce cheap electric power:
"
7001,"It has become necessary to reduce, to the extent possible, the outlays involved in the production of electric -power, its transmission and distribution.
"
7002,"The step in this direction is the identification of the right project and this has received ample emphasis in the policy measure enunciated in the Seventh Plan.
"
7003,"In general, big projects tend to be more economic.
"
7004,"But as the power generated by big projects likely to be fully consumed only domestically, efforts and studies identifying export possibilities of surplus power will have to be continued.
"
7005,"Producting electricity at relatively cheap costs will help conserve forests to a certain extent by increasing the demand and consumption of electric power and will also result in substituting the imports of costly petroleum.
"
7006,"However, to produce electric power relatively cheaply it is necessary to enhance the level of national technical expertise and to expand gradually the production of goods and materials such as wires and cables, poles and other like equipment necessary for power projects.
"
7007,"1. Increase the Demand of Power in other Productive Sectors
"
7008,"Electric power is an essential infrastructure for the development of productive sectors such as industry, tourism, transport, agriculture and other.
"
7009,"However, formulation and implementation of different plans to increase the demand of electricity from these sectors seem to be required.
"
7010,"2. Revise the Electricity-tariff Rates
"
7011,"Revision to encourage higher utilization of electricity has to be effected in the present tariff structure rate, which discourages higher consumption by charging progressive higher charges.
"
7012,"If changes in the present tariff structure are made to this effect then the domestic and other sector will substitute other kinds of imported fuel for electricity and this will result in a significant increase in electricity consumption.
"
7013,"3. Increase Investment in Transmission and Distribution Systems It is not possible to increase the demand for electricity simply by increasing the power generation capacity but it is also essential to deliver the generated power to the customers to increase the effective demand.
"
7014,"Thus, to ensure adequate returns, it is essential to increase and balance the investments in transmission and distribution systems with the increase in generating capacity.
"
7015,"The policy to increase and balance investments in transmission and distribution systems will be adhered to in the plan period.
"
7016,"Thus, extension, improvements and necessary electrification activities to strengthen the distribution on system will be undertaken promptly as will be the construction of extension lines.
"
7017,"4. Study of the Internal Market
"
7018,"The Seventh Plan has identified the following objective, policy, working policy and programs for the development of the power sector.
"
7019,"Objective
"
7020,"1. To meet the increasing needs of different sectors such as industry, agriculture, commerce and transport and others by generating power from water resources available in the country.
"
7021,"2. To augment the development of cottage industry and of agriculture through the generation of power from small hydel projects in rural areas where the possibilities of supplying electricity facilities from big power projects do not exit.
"
7022,"3. To conserve the ever-decreasing forest area and to reduce the use of imported fuel materials by encouraging the different sectors of the economy to use electricity more extensively and by expanding its supply.
"
7023,"Policy
"
7024,"1. Projects adjudged appropriate will be executed to meet the long term and the medium term power supply needs of the country.
"
7025,"An inventory of hydro -electricity projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects will be developed for implementation after the selection of projects deemed attractive from an economic point of view.
"
7026,"2. Unified transmission system will be established by linking power generating centers to supply electricity in the main areas of consumption to ensure the development of regular and reliable distribution system.
"
7027,"3. Electrification programs will be made more extensive to augment the development and expansion of agricultural production and of cottage and small-scale industries in the Mountaineous and the Terai regions of the country.
"
7028,"For the implementation of these programs, small hydel plants will be developed whereas electrification can not be provided through the unified transmission system.
"
7029,"4. Research and studies on the technical and management aspects will be undertaken with the aim of reducing the construction and operational expenditures of small hydro-electricity projects.
"
7030,"Studies will also be taken up on the electricity-tariffs charged by these projects to fix these tariffs at the appropriate levels.
"
7031,"5. Especial attention will be devoted to develop electricity-based transportation to substitute the import of petroleum. 6. Hydro electricity projects will be executed to the extent possible, as multipurpose projects on the basis of other possible functions of these projects.
"
7032,"7. Especial efforts will be made to utilize to a maximum the generating capacity of projects which are already operating by properly and efficiently running these projects and to ensure that the supply and distribution of electricity in regular and reliable by discouraging leakage, necessary legal provisions will also be enacted to control leakage.
"
7033,"2. With the objective of producing electricity of cheap rates, projects identified as being attracted on the basis of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies will be implemented.
"
7034,"3. Especial importance will be accorded to extend the unified electricity system to supply electricity generated by different centers to the more area of consumption.
"
7035,"4. Expansion and strengthening of the distribution system will be stressed in view of the reality that it is possible to ensure adequate returns from past investments if the distribution system at different power generating centers are not sufficiently extended and strengthened.
"
7036,"5. Electrification programs will be implemented tin the district head quarters and other places of other places of the country to maximize the utilization of limited resources on the basis of the following consideration:
"
7037,"i. 	area with economic potentials,
"
7038,"ii. area with possibility of underground and pump irrigation and the development of cottage and small scale industries,
"
7039,"iii. area adjoining areas where electrification works have already been completed, and iv. area in proximity of hydro -electricity generating plant.
"
7040,"6. Studies and other measures will be undertaken to reduce the construction, operation and maintenance costs of projects.
"
7041,"7. The survey and design phases will receive special attention in the construction of small hydel plants.
"
7042,"In addition, the possibility maximum mobilization of local labour and other resources will also be taken into consideration while generating electrical power.
"
7043,"Highest priority will be accorded to encourage the utilization of power generated from small hydel project in project in productive uses.
"
7044,"8. To develop and expand the production capacity of mechanical equipment necessary for micro and mini hydeo-electricity projects and other goods and equipment necessary for electrification process and to improve the quality of these products, discussions and negotiations with the local manufacturing firms will be held on a regular basis and necessary incentives will also be provided to them.
"
7045,"Physical Targets of the Seventh Plan
"
7046,"Power Development Program
"
7047,"Projects to be implemented under this program in the Seventh Plan are classified along the following lines:
"
7048,"a) 	Large Hydro-electricity Projects
"

"
7086,"Keeping in view the projected demand for electricity supply, it is necessary to identify a project during the
"
7087,"Seventh Plan period, which can be developed at least to the construction phase. Thus, a detailed engineering study of a project from among Sapta Gandaki (2,25,000 kw) and Kali gandaki (90,000 kw) the feasibility study of which have alredy been clomopleted and of Arun III or of a project from other projects identified as feasible will be undretaken.
"
7088,"Necessary arrangement to construct the most feasible one from among these two projects will also be made.
"
7089,"2. Small Hydro-electricity Project:
"
7090,"Detailed designing of projects after necessary surveys, pre-feasibility studies for the establishment of small hydro-electricity project will be continued in the Seventh Plan, especially in those areas where supply of electricity through the development of transmission and distribution networks is likely to take a long time and those areas which have not been covered from surveys conducted earlier.
"
7091,"The following programs have been included under this in the plan period.
"
7092,"a) Projects with less than 100 kw generating capacity
"
7093,"With a view to encourage the establishment and operation of projects with a generating capacity of upto 100 kw in the private sector, a directory containing projects which have been found feasible after preliminary studies will be published on a regular basis. The preliminary studies will be undertaken as a form of technical assistance to the private sector.
"
7094,"To assist the private sector, an annual on the appropriate structure and standard equipment needed for the construction of such projects will also be published in a way which can be used even by the general public.
"
7095,"In addition, financial loan assistance and other technical assistance will also be available for such construction purposes.
"
7096,"b) Projects with generating capacity from 100 kw to 500 kw will be identified and feasibility study of projects from among these will be taken up.
"
7097,"Under this program feasibility study of a hydro-electricity project in Myagdi and Aruntar hydro -electricity project in Gorkha will be taken up and a project will also be constructed if found feasible.
"
7098,"3. Survey of Transmission Lines Generation of electricity was emphasized to great extent in the Sixth Plan period.
"
7099,"But to ensure adequate returns from investments made in producing electricity development of transmission lines is also necessary. Thus, development of transmission lines has been stressed by this Plan.
"
7100,"Survey of the 150-km long Nepalgunj- Dhangadhi-Mahendranagar transmission line will be completed to extend the transmission line will be completed to extended the transmission from the Anarmani in the east to Nepalgunj in the west to be constructed during this plan period.
"
7101,"In addition, survey of a 500 km long 33 kv transmission line to supply to different centers of consumption from the 132 kv transmission line stretching from the east of the country to the west will also be completed.

"
7103,"c) Miscellaneous
"
7104,"Multipurpose Projects
"
7105,"Multipurpose projects are those projects based on reservoirs which can supply irrigation water and help flood- control in addition to the generation of electricity.
"
7106,"Kankai, Bagmati, , Karnali (Chisapani) and Pancheshwore (Mahakali) projects fall under this category.
"
7107,"Especial priority will be accorded to develop projects like Karnali (Chisapani) and Pancheshwore (Mahakali) which have potentials to export electricity from among the projects listed above.
"
7108,"In addition, efforts will also be made to implement other Pro jects like Karnali and Bagmati.
"
7109,"Electricity projects which benefit a particular district only and not two or more districts and which are not operated under development boards are defined as districts and which are not operated under development boards are defined as district level projects. Projects related with electrification and extension, system improvement, construction of 33 kv line transmission lines and related with operation of diesel plants, are all projects at the district level.
"
7110,"A total sum of Rs 644.5 million has been allocated for these projects by the Seventh Plan. Expenditure

7112,"Chapter 38 (B)
"
7113,"ALTERNATIVE ENERGY
"
7114,"Introduction
"
7115,"At present, the per capita consumption of energy in  is 224-kg oil equivalent of which about 94 percent is met from traditional sources of energy and the remaining 6 percent from modern commercial fuels.
"
7116,"Price increase of the POL products in 1973/74 and in 1979/80 and the consequent crisis affected  as well and, indeed, led to a slow down in the pace of development in addition, to the adverse effects on the balance of payments.
"
7117,"On the other hand, forests are being denuded in the uncontrolled manner mainly for the supply of fuelwood and timber and for resettlement purposes. These factors have led to a worsening of the energy problems and have, at the same time, affected the ecological balance adversely.
"
7118,"Though water resources is one of the most important valuable and basic infrastructure for the overall development of the country having a high potential to generate surplus power for export, harnessing of this resources needs huge amounts of capital, numerous technical manpower and a long time horizon especially in term of export, harnessing of his resources needs huge amounts of capital, numerous technical manpower and a long time horizon especially in terms of pre -investment and feasibility studies and in terms of construction.
"
7119,"Development of forest resources, which represents another national asset, also needs huge financial and human resources in addition to the long time involved from planting of saplings to their fuel growth.
"
7120,"In the above background, it has become essential to promote and implement programs directed at the development of alternative sources, sources of energy, conservation of sources of energy and at the substitution of energy to ensure supply in the future.
"
7121,"In this connection, programs which aim at the development of bio-gas, solar and wind-power distribution of improved Chulo to conserve fuel-wood installation of cross-flow turbine and multipurpose power unit in the conventional water mill to increase its horse-power, research and analysis to identify cheap alternative source of energy and at providing necessary incentives to their producers, have to developed and implemented.
"
7122,"The proposed outline for the development of alternative sources of alternative sources of energy has been developed taking into consideration all these factors.
"
7123,"Review of the Sixth Plan
"
7124,"Sixth Plan had aimed at developing arrangements to provide necessary assistance and to facilitate programs designed at research and analysis of cheap alternative sources of energy and to programs designed to increase the productio n of these sources of energy.
"
7125,"However, the government sector could not provide the necessary assistance and support to these activities.
"
7126,"In the area of forest conservation and tree planting, conservation and planting activities in addition to the distribution of improved Chulo were undertaken under the community forest development project and some other projects.
"
7127,"Around 1620 bio-gas plants, at the family and community level, have been constructed in addition to the installation of 250 cross-flow turbines and multipurpose water-mills which have provided at concessional rates directly to the farmers and through the small farmers development projects by the Agricultural Development Bank under the loan assistance of Asian Development Bank. In addition, grants from UNICEF were also received for these activities.
"
7128,"Some private sector establishments also seem to be engaged in the production of solar water- heaters and solar-drier. Projection of Demand and Supply of Energy during the Seventh Plan period.
"
7129,"It has been estimated that the annual demand of the total energy needs will be 3781 kilo-ton, oil- equivalent by the end of the Sixth Plan period and this further estimated to increase to 4356 kilo-ton and oil equivalent per annum buy the end of the Seventh Plan.
"
7130,"Of this total demand, 93 percent is estimated to be accounted by domestic uses, 3 percent by commercial and industrial sector, 3 percent by transport sector and the rest 1 percent by other sectors.
"
7131,"In total consumption of energy, consumption of petroleum products, electrical-power, coal and lignite, fuel-wood and other traditional resources of energy is estimated as follows: The following objectives, policy, working policy and programs have been identified by the Seventh Plan for the development of the alternative sources of energy:
"
7132,"Objective 1. To meet the energy needs and to reduce the dependence on traditional sources of energy through the development of alternative sources of energy.
"
7133,"2. To encourage the wide spread use of improved and appropriate techniques to reduce the consumption of fuel- woods by the domestic sector. 3. To develop and expand the use of productive techniques through appropriate improvements in the traditional techniques in rural areas, especially in the context of the use of hydro-energy.
"
7134,"Policy
"
7135,"1. To encourage the development of alternative sources of energy, especially to the development of bio-gas plants, solar and wind energy and to accord a greater importance to the role of the private sector in this area.
"
7136,"2. To expand the distribution and use of improved Chulo in an extensive manner with appropriate encouragement to the private sector to the private sector to reduce consumption of fuel-woods.
"
7137,"In addition, research will also be undertaken to develop techniques designed to reduce the consumption of fuelwoods.
"
7138,"3. To undertake research activities to develop and construct cheap and appropriate bio-gas plants to suit the different climatic conditions of the different parts of the country.
"
7139,"4. The use of small water turbines and of improved water mills will be propagated and encouraged on a wide-scale in the rural areas, especially to augment the development of agriculture and cottage industry and to supply electricity to these areas.
"
7140,"Working Policy
"
7141,"1. Necessary assistance and incentives as may be justified will be provided to encourage the involvement of the private sector in the development and expansion of use of alternative sources of energy and to make the role of the agencies and institution involved in this area more effective.
"
7142,"Consumers will also be provided with financial assistance either in the form of grants or loans to promote the use of these alternative uses of energy.
"
7143,"3. Highest priority will be accorded to the production and distribution of bio -gas plants, improved Chulo and improved water mills as there is a great potential to increase there uses.
"
7144,"4. Data will be collected and analyzed and the available techniques propagated in an applied basis to develop solar energy and wind energy.
"
7145,"5. The use of local skill and technology, labour and resources will be encouraged in the development of alternative sources of energy.
"
7146,"6. Research, surveys and studies will be undertaken to develop alternative sources of energy.
"
7147,"Likewise, technical manpower will be developed through the mechanism of imparting training to the local people.
"
7148,"The following programs in the area of development of alternative sources of energy, energy conservation, energy substitution and in the area of research and analysis in the use of alternative sources of energy have been identified for implementation during the Seventh Plan.
"
7149,"1. Establishments of Bio-gas Plants
"
7150,"Gas from these bio-gas plants can be used for cooking purposes, for lighting purposes, for operating small mills for processing agricultural products and for electrification.
"
7151,"Bio -gas plants can be expected to contributed positively in the improvement of the environment in addition to usher pleasant changes in domestic life by providing clean, easy and smokeless sources of energy.
"
7152,"It has been found necessary to provide subsidy to the users and to provide encouragement to the products of bio-gas plants to promote the production of these plants. Thus, a provision to sell these plants at 25 percent less than the production cost and to provide the differential in the production and the sales price to the producer in the form of a grant will be implemented.
"
7153,"This grant to the producers has been calculated on the basis of savings accruing to the government through less use of fuel woods which will be thew case if the bio-gas plants are used. During this plan period, a total of 4,000 bio-gas plants will be established throughout the Kingdom, the breakdown of which on a fiscal year basis is provided as follows:
"
7154,"Establishment of the 4,000 bio-gas plants, ranging in size from 100 cubic feet, is expected to provided energy sufficient to meet the cooking and lighting needs of a population of 42,000. Savings of about 16,000 ton (22,000 cubic meters) of fuel wood and of 960 kilo liter of kerosene (for lighting purpose only are expected to be made form the use of these plants.
"
7155,"In monetary terms, these savings will amount to Rs 18 million needed to develop 3,000 hectares of land for productive forest to produce the above mentioned quantity of fuel woods and to Rs5.7 million in foreign exchange needed to import kerosene.
"
7156,"In addition, foreign exchange to the tune of Rs 16 million will also be saved, as these plants will produce about 2,800 metric tons of organic fertilizers.
"
7157,"2. Distribution of Improved Chulo
"
7158,"Significant contributions can be expected from the improved Chulo in reducing the consumption of fuel-woods and thus, to the conservation of forest as these Chulos are supposed to use only 50 percent of the fuelwood used by traditional Chulos.
"
7159,"Program on the distribution of improved Chulos is expected to ease the present pressure on forest and to reduce the need to plant saplings to significant context.
"
7160,"As an integrated component of this program, measures designed to increase the acceptability of the customers by seeking their choice and their approvals in design developments. In addition, regular review and evaluation of this program will also be undertaken.
"
7161,"The activities undertaken by different agencies will also be coordinated.
"
7162,"Under this program, improved Chulo will be distributed in  and other district facing fuelwood shortage free for charge.
"
7163,"However, transportation cost from the godown to the user's house and installation charges will have to borne by the users themselves.
"
7164,"Training programs to the polters producing the Chulos, to the workmen involved in their installation and to the users for repair and maintenance will also be undertaken.
"
7165,"During the plan period, a total of 160 thousand improved Chulos will be distributed as follows: If the distribution of 160 thousand improved Chulo is estimated to cost Rs 16 million, a saving of Rs 270 million is estimated to be made on the basis of the fact that these chulos require only 50 percent of the fuel wood required by the traditional chulo(cooking stove).
"
7166,"3. Installation of Turbines and Improved Water-mills There are about 25,000 traditional water mills scattered all over the country in .
"
7167,"If these water mills could be improved to produce even only 10 kw each then an addition 250 mw of power could generated. In present context, the private sector is manufacturing multipurpose power unit (MPPU) and cross-flow turbines of different capacity and these have the potential of substituting the use of traditional water mills.
"
7168,"In addition, these turbines and water mills produce more power that the traditional water mills, can process a more diversified ranged of agricultural products and can even generate electricity for distribution to the immediate neighborhood.
"
7169,"A system to subsidies 10 percent of the total installation charge will be developed to promote the use of multipurpose power unit and cross flow turbines.
"
7170,"In addition the practice of making available loans at concessional rates from the Agricultural Development Bank will be continued.
"
7171,"It is estimated that during the Plan period, 640 multipurpose power units (on an average, 5 horse-power) and 320 cross flow turbines (10-20 horse power) will be installed and HMG will have to provide grants to the tune of Rs 4.8 million.
"
7172,"4. Solar and Wind Energy Development Program
"
7173,"The scientific use of solar and wind energy has to be accepted as being negligible upto now in  despite the fact that the development of these sources of energy can be important sources of energy supply. In the area of solar energy, the private sector has been involved in the manufacture of solar water-heaters and driers.
"
7174,"However, as the process of transforming solar energy to electrical power involves relatively high costs we are yet to come to a stage where this technique can be used by the general people
"
7175,"Though the scientific use of both solar and wind energy is very limited in the present context, it is necessary to collect data and information in these area and to analyze them right from now on in view of the potential role of these sources of energy in future.
"
7176,"This, in this context, a program to establish around twenty stations with equipment to measure solar heat and wind speeds is expected to be implemented during the Seventh Plan.
"
7177,"To the extent possible, this equipment will be installed in hydrology and meteorology related stations.
"
7178,"The private sector will be provided with necessary incentives to promote and develop the use of solar energy, especially to encourage a more extensive and wind spread use of useful technologies, such as the solar water heaters and driers.
"
7179,"In addition, program aiming at tax-rebates to reduce the prices of these products and at providing necessary encouragement and incentives to the producers will also be implemented as the use of this source energy is likely to significantly reduce the consumption of electricity and fuel wood and of imported oil products.
"
7180,"In addition, programs will be implemented to encourage the use of this source of energy to develop irrigation and cottage industry in those areas, which are short of other sources of fuel.
"
7181,"Appropriate steps will also be initiated to develop this source of energy on the basis of surveys, studies, data collection and analysis and of the existing techniques.
"
7182,"At amount of Rs2.5 million has been earmaked for the implementation of this program.
"
7183,"5. Research and Development
"
7184,"There are numerous research and development opportunities in the area of alternative source of energy as this is a relatively new field.
"
7185,"Though there are a number of government, semi-government and private agencies involved in these activities, research and development works have not progressed much mainly because of shortage of necessary financial resources, lack of coordination and the lack of specified goals.
"
7186,"In this background, the Seventh Plan addresses itself to improving these identified deficiencies. to be more specific priority will be accorded to the research and development works in the following areas:
"
7187,"i. 	designing of less expensive solar water heater, cooker and direr,
"
7188,"ii. designing of less expensive and more effective bio-gas plants and developing techniques which will ensure the same quantity of gas even in winter season,
"
7189,"iii. designing of further improved Chulos, iv. designing of residential house which can maximize the use of solar heat, and
"
7190,"v. development of less-expensive, simple and easy to operate water mills and other water based equipment.
"
7191,"A total Rs 3.2 million has been ear-marked for this program.
"
7192,"All these considerations reinforce the need to develop water resource and energy in a planned and dynamic manner.
"
7193,"As mostly the government agencies are involved in the task of increasing the use of water resources, it was felt necessary that the activities of these agencies have to be well coordinated with clear and specific goals and a proper guideline has to be enunciated.
"
7194,"A national body to coordinate and guide the activities of these agencies was sorely needed.
"
7195,"Thus, keeping in view al these considerations, His Majesty's Government formed in fiscal year 1975/76, that is, during the Fifth Plan period, a Water and Energy Commission with the representation of all the concerned agencies. In addition, arrangements have been made for this Commission to be chaired by the Minister for Water Resources.
"
7196,"A permanent Secretariat with experts in related fields has also been established for effective operation.
"
7197,"It has become necessary to identify and develop programs for implementation by this Commission during the Seventh Plan as this Commission has significant potentials in carrying out studies, research and analysis, exploration and project formulation related tasks and in providing technical advice for the development of water resources.
"
7198,"The secretariat of the Water and Energy Commission has been involved in extending assistance in formulation of water resource and energy related projects, collection of basic data, research and standardization, determination of existing manpower, preparation of project profiles of different project, study of investment outlays for different projects, study on the allocation of investment and their benefits of large projects, evaluation of the general impact of such projects and in conducting studies on the development of alternative sources of energy.
"
7199,"In addition, the Secretariat has also been involved in the development of an economic impact model for water resource, in the application of the basic assumption of this model and in studies on national and international laws related to Nepal and of international arguments on, and management of, these laws have also been going on.
"
7200,"Canadian government is involved in extending assistance to the Secretariat.
"
7201,"Efforts will be directed at further strengthening the Secretariat during the Seventh Plan.
"
7202,"Objective
"
7203,"1. To facilitate the planned and rapid development of water resources by coordinating the activities of all the concerned agencies and by providing specific guide lines.
"
7204,"2. To orient the focus of the program on water resource control and conservation to the water use needs of the country as a whole.
"
7205,"Policy
"
7206,"1. Efforts to coordinate the activities of the agencies involved in water resource and energy sectors will be continued further.
"
7207,"2. National laws and rules and regulations related to water resource and energy will be devised and developed and programs will be formulated on detailed surveys and exploitation, studies on present and future needs, resource conservation and development and long and short -term projects related to the water resource utilization of the county.
"
7208,"Total sum of Rs 5.6 million has been earmarked for the programs of Water and Energy Commission to be implemented during the Seventh Plan period.
"
7209,"CHAPTER 38 (D) ENVIRONMENT
"
7210,"The objective conditions of land, water living organisms and biosphere, their pattern of utilization and interactions can be defined to constitute the environment as such.
"
7211,"The developmental activities organized by human beings are indeed an integral part of the environment.
"
7212,"In the interactions of different elements constituting the environment as such are balanced, then we have a table environment whereas the environmental conditions tend to deteriorate if these elements are not balanced. Likewise, a close relationship subsists between land-use and environment.
"
7213,"The changes made by man on land-use patterns tend to affect the ecosystem which in itself can affect the welfare of mankind. These consideration leads to the conclusion that environment has to be included as a determinant in the developmental efforts of human beings.
"
7214,"In the developed countries, environmental problems seem to originate from industrialization and modernization, whereas in a country like Nepal these problems can be attributed to ignorance, poverty and the rapid growth in population. maintenance of a balanced ecological system seems to get more and more difficult especially as the rapid increase in population pressure and rapid expansion of developmental activities seem to cause denudation of forests, land-erosion, floods, drying-up of water sources and shortage of fuel woods, grass and other like sources of energy.
"
7215,"In addition, industrialization, modernization, and tourism development also seem to be contributing to ecological disturbances.
"
7216,"The main objective of environment management will be to mitigate the adverse effects of the mentioned factors and to maintain a balanced environment. In addition, proper land-use patterns and a sound environment management system are the basic per-requisites to control the process of desertification, to increase land-productivity and to implement balanced development plans.
"
7217,"Formation of the Department of Soil and Water Conservation and of the Department of National Parks and Wild -life Conservation are the results of some of the steps taken by His Majesty's Government. Likewise, implementation of integrated rural development projects, watershed management, community forest development and other projects with afforestation component have contributed positively to the forest development program while the establishment of a Remote Sensing Center has helped generate data on environmental status.
"
7218,"In this background, the establishment of Mahendra Nature Conservation Fund and the establishment of International Center for Integrated mountain development (ICIMOD) with the assistance of UNESCO and other friendly countries can be expected to play a significant role, the latter not only in Nepal but also in regional context, in the conservation and development of a balance environment.
"
7219,"Study project on environmental impacts was also taken up by the Department of Land and Water Conservation during the second year of the Sixth Plan.
"
7220,"This Project has been involved in drafting a national policy and legal measures on environmental conservation, in study and evaluation of the impacts of developmental programs on environment and in organizing training, seminars and conferences in addition to publication of materials on conservation of nature.
"
7221,"Likewise, Nepal national Committee on Man and Biosphere has also been involved in conduction research on related issues.
"
7222,"This Committee in fact ushered in the right atmosphere for the establishment of ICIMOD.
"
7223,"As the formulation of a first phase national conservation policy has already been completed and the report already prepared with the assistance of IUCN, efforts to initiate works on the second phase during the Seventh Plan period are being made.
"
7224,"The election of Nepal to the governing council of united Nations Environmental Program for a three year period starting from 1984 can also be expected to facilitate exchange and inflow of information or conservation efforts made in the international context and to mobilize external resources for conservation efforts in Nepal itself.
"
7225,"In the above background, it has to be accepted that there are many a tasks to be undertaken in the area of land use and environment conservation but it has to be accepted that these tasks are by no means easy.
"
7226,"In addition, nature conservation and proper land use functions can not be the responsibility of a single agency, but needs a multi dimensional and multi institutional approach.
"
7227,"Thus, formulation and implementation of programs in these areas need multi sectoral approach and a good coordination. Problems in Implementation
"
7228,"a) 	The National Resources Conservation Commission, formed in the Sixth Plan to provide necessary guidelines at the national level to the concerned agencies, has not been able to function effectively as desired. One of the main reasons for this has been to keep this commission as an agency of the Ministry of Forest and Land Conservation.
"
7229,"b) 	The Sixth Plan could not arrange for the training and development of manpower and expertise in conformity with the multidimensional nature of environmental management. c) 	Study and evaluation programs have suffered mainly because no system has been devised and developed to specify a nationally acceptable minimum level of pollution and to develop the manpower necessary to undertake these activities.
"
7230,"d) 	Continued collection of data and their interpretation and research and analysis are very essential for the development of a sound environment management program.
"
7231,"Forgoing ahead in this area has proved difficult mainly because of the absence of a central-level body to look in this area, though there are some agencies presently engaged in these activities.
"
7232,"In the above background, the Seventh Plan has identified the following objective, policy and program for implementation in the area of environment and land use.
"
7233,"Objective
"
7234,"1. To control environmental degradation caused by developmental activities and other factors and to bring about and maintain a positive relationship between development activities and environmental management.
"
7235,"2. To preserve the interest and welfare of the common people by reducing the level of water, air and sound pollution.
"
7236,"The process of conservation of important and sensitive watershed areas through afforestation, flood control and other measures will be continued.
"
7237,"Program 1. Necessary steps will be taken to further strengthen the present National Natural Resource Conservation Commission so that the Commission can play a more effective role in maintaining a proper balance between man and natural resources and environment.
"
7238,"2. Necessary arrangements will be made guidelines on these arrangements will be prepared in conformity with the policy to incorporate elements of environmental factors right from the formulation stage of developmental plans and projects so that there are no adverse effects of these plans projects on the ecological system.
"
7239,"In addition, studies to evaluate the effects of industrial, tourism, water-resources, transportation, urbanization, agriculture, forest and other developmental programs on environment will also be undertaken.
"
7240,"3. Scientific research and analysis will be continued in an unceasing and effective manner in areas related to resources conservation and development in addition to specifying a minimum standard of environmental cleanliness.
"
7241,"4. Pilot projects exhib iting balanced environment of different geographical and ecological regions of the country will be implemented.
"
7242,"5. Exchange of information and knowledge on major achievements in the area of resources conservation and management will be promoted at an international level by establishing and developing relations with the concerned agencies. In addition, information on resources conservation and management will be disseminated within the country through the medium of studies, exhibition and education.
"
7243,"6. The present rules and regulations on resources conservation and utilization will be implemented effectively in addition to formulating acts on conservation of national ecology and environment.
"
7244,"7. Study of environmental aspects will be made compulsory at the school and college levels and necessary steps to prepare a syllabus and textbook in this subject will also be taken.
"
7245,"8. Study and training opportunities, both within the country and outside, will be developed to develop necessary manpower on resource conservation, utilization and management. In addition, the program in national development service will also be oriented to the area of natural resource and environment conservation.
"
7246,"9. A report on the status of environment will be prepared during the Seventh Plan period in addition to the preparation of a yearly report on the quantity of natural resources and environmental situation at a regional and the national level.
"
7247,"Individuals, social institutions and organizations, non-governmental agencies, class organizations and local panchayats will be encouraged to be more active and necessary arrangements to award reco9gnitions and assistance as incentives will also be made.
"
7248,"Efforts on the formulation aspect of a national conservation policy and programs will also be developed and implemented after the finalization of national conservation policy.
"
7249,"Education materials are being made available increasingly at the school level. Improvements are being made in the distribution of education materials. Besides, the extension and consolidation of school level education is being emphasized in remote areas.
"
7250,"Arrangements are being made for extra-curricular activities in may y schools. In the national education plan, priority has been assigned to meeting the need of technical manpower, Some substantial achievements have been made in this direction during the Sixth Plan period.

"
7254,"(a) 	School Education
"
7255,"Comparing the situation of primary, lower secondary and secondary education in the final year of the Fifth Plan 1979/80 with the final year of the Sixth Plan 1984/85, it becomes clear that the number of school, students and teacher at all the three levels has increased satisfactorily.
"
7256,"Annual statement about this is given in the attached table.

"
7271,"An education project was launched in Seti Zone with a view to bring about qualitative improvement in education by adopting new techniques for various aspects of education, such as, teachers' training and supervision, curriculum design, preparation of text books and education materials.
"
7272,"Science education project was started in order to make provisions for imparting science education of good standard by improving the teaching and learning process in science, mathematics and English subjects.
"
7273,"Similarly, primary education project was undertaken to improve the quality of education at this level. Primary education is the foundation stone of higher education.

"
7285,"Teachers training was not considered necessary for permanent appointment. Number of trained teachers could not be increased according to target.
"
7286,"The supervision system also could not be made effective. For the formulation of education plan, reliable statistics are still not available on schools, teachers and students.

"
7667,"HEALTH
"
7668,"Health service is the basic needs of the general people. The production of healthy manpower has an important role in the health sector.
"
7669,"The periodical plans have been giving attention to develop the country's health sector in a consistent and planned manner and to raise the level of health standard.
"
7670,"With a long-term view in the development of health sector, a 15 year perspective plan was adopted with effect from the Fifth Plan.
"
7671,"Accordingly, special emphasis was placed on providing basic health services to the maximum number of people during the Fifth and Sixth Plan periods; During these periods, important achievements have been made according to targets specified by the plans.
"
7672,"In some areas, implementation has not been able to proceed as specified.
"
7673,"Therefore, during the Seventh Plan period, health service needs to be made more service oriented by means of primary health care and it is equally important to ensure implementation to reach targeted goals and fulfil objectives specified in the plan.
"
7674,"The Seventh Plan which is the final plan in the IS-year perspective of the long-term health plan is based on the same context. Further, the long-term objective of providing health services to everybody by the year 2000 has been taken as the main basis of the Seventh Plan.

"
7702,"Family planning services were made available to 1,504,035 couples, including permanent vasectomy service to 276,196 and temporary family planning devices to 1,227,839 families.
"
7703,"This includes the progress recorded by various bodies that provide family planning services including the Family Planning Association, Maternity and Child Welfare Projects and Integrated Community Health Services Development Project.
"
7704,"For maternity and child welfare, the targets were to provide antinatal health services to 150,000 women and post-natal health services to 1,000,000 women and children. Under the family planning and maternity child welfare project, health services were provided to 521,568 women and 1,897,230 children.
"
7705,"In order to make family planning programme effective, seminars, radio programmes, publications of papers and brochures and training works were also undertaken under information and publicity programme.
"
7706,"The population growth rate was estimated to remain at 2.3 percent during the Sixth Plan period. The census of 1981 revealed the rate to be 2.66 percent during the 1971-81 decade.
"
7707,"In order to control this unexpected rate of population growth, permanent vasectomy and distribution of temporary devices were emphasized and steps like wage compensation, development bonds, educational facilities and maternity leave were also implemented in this direction.
"
7708,"Under the nutrition programme during the Sixth Plan period, 150,000 children below the age of 5 years were provided nutrition care, and under nutrition children were treated. About 11,900 children with mal-nutrition, 20,000 children with anemia, 15,500 children with diahrea and 70,971 children with worms were also provided treatment.

"
7710,"Under this, iodine v8.ccine was provided to prevent goitre in 29 districts in Himali and hilly region where throat diseases were widespread.
"
7711,"Further, the distribution of iodized salt has been continued.

"
7715,"For the prevention of junotic diseases, necessary survey was undertaken of vice encephalitis disease, blood samples of affected persons were collected for seriological test, and studies were made also of plague and poisonous snake bite.
"
7716,"Noteworthy progress has been made during the Sixth Plan period in the production of manpower fo_ health.
"
7717,"This has led to the increase in middle level and high level manpower.
"
7718,"The health programmes implemented during the Sixth Plan period have exerted a favourable effect on estimated longevity, infant mortality rate and crude death rate which are the indicators of health status of the people. The target of the Sixth Plan was to reduce crude birth rate fro1l' 19 to 17 per thousand and infant mortality rate from 150 to 130 per thousand.
"
7719,"By the end of the plan period, crude birth rate is estimated to have been reduced to 16.57 and infant mortality rate to i11.52 per thousand.
"
7720,"These are the main problems relating to construction. For these reasons, construction works on health post, hospitals and various buildings of health organizations at central and district level have lagged behind every year.
"
7721,"Because of hospital construction lagging behind due to delay in construction works, the work of establishing 15-bed hospitals as specified in the Sixth Plan was adversely affected.
"
7722,"Problems have come up also in the production of higher and middle level technical manpower necessary for conducting and cohsolidating health services according to specified health post and hospital programmes.
"
7723,"Further, because of the lack of medicines, equipment and appliances in health units, the program of providing basic health services to general public in rural areas as specified in the Sixth Plan could not be implemented effectively.
"
7724,"Other problems relating to the development of health sector relate to management difficulties.
"
7725,"The policies and working policies in the Seventh Plan have been designed with a view to gradually solving the problems that came up during the Sixth Plan period.
"
7726,"Background of the Seventh Plan
"
7727,"Encouraging progress has been made in the health sector as a result of the efforts made during past plan periods for the development of this sector. However, in view of the indicators of health status of the general public, Nepalese health standard is very low as compared to the standard of developing countries.
"
7728,"During the Sixth Plan period, some improvements have been made in this direction. It is however, self-evident that more efforts are necessary in coming years to raise the health standard of the country.
"
7729,"The Seventh Plan envisages targets to reduce crude de[1.th rate to 12.8 per thousand and infant mortality rate to 98.3 per thousand live births and to raise average longevity to 55.4 years.
"
7730,"For this purpose, it becomes necessary to provide effective health services in a major part of the country.

"
7770,"Basic health service is being provided through the medium of health posts at present at the rural level in an integrated manner under integrated community health service development project. In those districts where the services have not been integrated, these services are being provided through different projects.
"
7771,"The objective of gradually integrating health projects and providing basic health services will be continued in the Seventh Plan and program implemented under various projects will be gradually integrated.
"
7772,"a) Integrated Community Health Service Development
"
7773,"Health posts have been established in the form of basic unit of health service with a view to making available minimum health facilities to the maximum number of people in rural areas.
"
7774,"It is estimated that by the end of the Sixth Plan period the total number of health posts in the kingdom will be raised to 794 and each district area will have a health post.
"
7775,"In accordance with the policy to gradually integrate health posts and to provide Promotional, preventive and general health services through a single unit, 450 health posts in 23 districts are providing integrated health services so far partially and fully.
"
7776,"Under this, family planning service, collection of blood samples of malaria patients, treatment of tuberculosis and leprosy patients are provided in an integrated form along with various vaccines to children of 0-5 years and nutrition and other services.
"
7777,"While implementing integrated programme, the existing system of conducting in an integrated form selected health posts within the district will be ended and in the Seventh Plan integration will be adopted as a process to be implemented on a district wide scale.
"
7778,"Accordingly, only after the various projects conducted at the district level are integrated, all the health posts of that district will make available integrated service.
"
7779,"After the commencement of the decentralization plan, in close contact with the population and health coordination committee to be organized in district, the preparation of district health plan and health administration will be undertaken by district level units.
"
7780,"The target of the Seventh Plan is to study the services that will be integrated while implementing the interpretation programme, the need for technical and administrative manpower following the integration programme and to implement fully integrated service in additional 27 districts in a planned way during the plan period.
"
7781,"Thus, inclusive of the 10 districts where the integrated service was implemented during the Sixth Plan period, the integrated service will be in operation in 37 districts by the end of the Seventh Plan period.
"
7782,"In these districts, under the integrated programme during the Seventh Plan period, family planning service, vaccination to children, vaccination against malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, nutrition and other services will be made available.
"
7783,"According to the programme to impart training to health technicians under health posts, training of community health cadres will be conducted at the ward level.
"
7784,"In order to make available to the rural people less expensive and effective health services in the context of mobilizing people's participation, the Seventh Plan has programmes to establish sub-health posts in addition to health posts that operate at area level.
"
7785,"Accordingly, in consolation with district panchayat, among health posts in the district one health post will be arranged as area level health post in every area.
"
7786,"In order to make effective the health services to be provided by rural health workers at door steps at the Parichayat level, provision will be made for sub -health posts.
"
7787,"Other health posts operating in the area will be converted into sub-health posts.

"
7789,"These sub- health posts will serve as intermediatery between the area health post and the rural people and according to need, will provide service also at door steps in coordination with ward level health volunteers.
"
7790,"While determining the site of health posts, the place with service centre will be chosen.
"
7791,"In remote Himali and hilly districts it is difficult to establish health centre is and arrangements will be made for health sub-posts. Priority will be given to remote Himali and hilly areas for the establishment of health sub-posts.
"
7792,"In order to develop health service from the community level on the basis of more people's participation, arrangements will be made for ward level community health cadres in districts where the integrated program has been in implementation since the Sixth Plan.
"
7793,"These health cadres will be provided short-term training. Since they have been helpful in increasing health consciousness at the ward level, during the Seventh Plan provision will be made for community health cadres with priority in districts where new health sub-posts will be established as necessary.
"
7794,"For the fulfillment of the objective to prove health services to everybody by the year 2000, community participation will be given highest role to provide primary health service at the rural level and these sub-posts will serve as intermediatery between the community and health posts.
"
7795,"Local construction materials will be used as far as possible in constructing and maintaining health post buildings.
"
7796,"Programmes for the development of health sector have also been included in Mahakali, Karnali, Bheri, Rasuwa Nuwakot, Sagarmatha and the Kosi Hill are integrated rural development projects.

7994,"In the Seventh Plan 133 thousand population will be benefited by drinking water supply after completing 9 on-going projects of the Sixth Plan and additional 5 deep tubewells.
"
7995,"3. New Rural Pipe Drinking Water Projects
"
7996,"During the plan period, the piped water from 13 new drinking water projects will be supplied to 1,325 thousand population.
"
7997,"While implementing new projects of pipe water supply in rural areas, priority will be accorded to the feasible projects out of the projects studied for feasibility. In addition, projects for which feasibility studies have not been conducted, such studies will be conducted and feasible projects will be gradually implemented.
"
7998,"In the implementation of such projects, rural areas with scanty supply of drinking water will be ordered priority.
"
7999,"Efforts taken by the got is not sufficient to provide the drinking water supply to the maximum number of people from the limited resolution. Therefore in the implementation of such projects, local labor, skill, resources and technology will be mobililsed to the maximum.
"
8000,"Consumers, committees and local panchayats will be involved in this endeavor.
"
8001,"From the government level necessary construction materials and technical services will be made available for the implementation of such projects.
"
8002,"4. Reforms, Renovation and Extension
"
8003,"The traditional natural sources like taps, ponds, wells were meeting some of drinking water requirements in many parts of the Kingdom. It is necessary to conserve and improve these traditional sources and maintain their services.
"
8004,"Thus during this plan period 50,000 populations will be benefited by the supply of drinking water from the conservation and improvement of the on-going taps, ponds, wells and constructing others at suitable places.
"
8005,"Necessary measures will be taken to control contamination of water from then sources.
"
8006,"Besides, completed projects will be modified, reconstructed and extended to supply drinking water to additional 90 thousand populations.
"
8007,"Only if these completed projects can be properly maintained, these projects can better contribute over a long time.
"
8008,"The responsibility of maintaining these projects should be handed over to local units. Only then the government's limited resources and means can be utilised for the implementation of new projects and maximum number of people served.
"
8009,"Therefore, the responsibility of operation of small and medium-scale projects will be handed over to the local level units.
"
8010,"Besides, these provisions will be made for the renovation, extension and modification of the completed projects.
"
8011,"5. Feasibility Study
"
8012,"If probable projects for the coming years could be identified along with their economic and technical feasibility studies, feasible projects can be incorporated at the time of plan formulation and then implemented. As such detailed feasibility studies will be conducted for 500 projects in the Seventh Plan.
"
8013,"In addition to the pure drinking water, sanitation has equal importance in public health.
"
8014,"In real sense it is the duty of all people to keep home surroundings neat and clean, But due to lack of publicity of public health and people awareness, most of the people have not paid due attention to hygiene.
"
8015,"Hence, importance of hygiene on health will be widely publicized to awaken peoples consciousness in co-ordination with the Ministry of Health during the Seventh Plan.
"
8016,"In order to arouse mass awareness towards sanitation programmes, 25 thousand low-coat toilets will be constructed as models.
"
8017,"Necessary technical assistance and construction materials will be made available by the government for the construction of low-coat toilets.
"
8018,"Of this, 10 thousand toilets will be constructed in the different schools to habituate people to use toilets.
"
8019,"The remaining 15 thousand toilets will be constructed in the necessary places of the semi-urban and densely populated rural arms.
"
8020,"This project will benefit 200 thousand populations.
"
8021,"Sewerage will be installed in densely populated urban areas and low-cost sanitation programmes launched in other urban areas.
"
8022,"Up to the end of the plan, sewerage facility will be extended to 164 thousand population in the densely populated urban was of the .
"
8023,"Similarly sewerage will be gradually introduced in the main urban areas of the kingdom like Nepalgunj, Bhairahawa, Butaul, Birgunj, Janakpur, Biratnagar and so forth.
"
8024,"7. Drinking Water Supply Programme in Urban Area
"
8025,"In order to improve the drinking water supply situation in the urban areas, the Department of Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage and the Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation are actively involved.
"
8026,"For the fulfillment of the drinking water needs in urban areas, Greater Kathmandu, Pokhara, Biratnagar and Birguni drinking water projects am under implementation with IDA loans and expected to be completed in the Sixth Plan.
"
8027,"Under the very International Development Association Loan, third phases of Greater Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Dharan, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Birguni, Hetauda, Pokhara, Butwul, Bhairahawa,,and Nepalganj are targeted to be completed in the fiscal year 1986/87.
"
8028,"After completion of this project the condition of the drinking water supply in these urban areas will greatly improve.
"
8029,"By the end of the Sixth Plan 109 litres of water will be available in the urban areas per capita per day in average.
"
8030,"The problem now facing the drinking water supply in Greater Kathmandu we the lack of surface water sources.
"
8031,"To solve this problem effort is being made to tap the ground water resources.
"
8032,"After completion of third phase project in 1986/87 an additional 83 thousand cubic meter of drinking water will be available and will fulfill the water requirements of the population up to the fiscal year 1991/92.
"
8033,"Regarding the supply of drinking water requirement after the year 1991/92, provision will be made in this plan to study and implement alternative ways and means.
"
8034,"Furthermore a long-term plan of drinking water supply will be prepared for the Kathmandu Valley in this plan period.
"
8035,"In the context of the fast increasing urbanization along with the development works, feasibility studies for the renovation and extension of drinking water facilities are being conducted, for other urban areas like Mahendranagar, Dhangadhi, Birendranagar, Tribhuvannagar, Bharatpur, Rajbiraj, Lahan, Dhankuta, Dhadrapur, Illam and others in addition to the urban areas with on-going projects.
"
8036,"In this plan period an additional 338 thousand population in the urban areas will get the benefit of the drinking water facility.
"
8037,"Of this, 300 thousand populations will benefit from the Drinking Water Supply and Sewerage Corporation and 38 thousand populations from the Department of Water Supply Water Sewerage.
"
8038,"The quality and quantity of drinking water will be improved, in addition to the provision of the drinking water will be improved, in addition to the provision of the drinking water facility to the additional population and the plan aims to supply 200 liters of drinking water per capita per day.
"
8039,"8. District Level Project under Decentralization
"
8040,"During the Seventh Plan, the district level projects will be implemented according to decentralization plan.
"
8041,"In the district level drinking water project, fall projects and impact of which is limited to a district and not within the domain of development committees.
"
8042,"Within this category comes the pipe water projects, shallow tubewells, sanitation programme, supervision and maintenance, while formulating and implementing district level products priority will be given to those urban, semi-urban and rural areas devoid of water supply facilities.
"
8043,"And approach will be to implement these project at the local level mobilizing local labour, skills and resources and with the support of construction materials and technical services.
"
8044,"This will increase the interest of the local panchayat and consumers in project implementation resulting in the completion of the projects a t low cost and within a short duration.
"
8045,"Only if appropriate arrangements are made for the operation and maintenance of completed projects, services from them can be derived for a long time.
"
8046,"Hence, the responsibility of operation and maintenance of the completed projects will be handed over to local panchayats and local consumers themselves.
"
8047,"The technical support locally unavailable will be made available from the central level. Thus, the role of local participation will be vital in the foirmulation, impleme ntation, operation, and supervision works of the district level projects.
"
8048,"Rs 111.94 million has been set aside in the Seventh Plan in tune with the decentralization plan. Although, projects now incorporated at the central level, which should be incorporated at the district level will gradually be incorporated in the district level programmes.

"
8411,"In the Seventh Plan period, attention will be focused on strengthening some ministries charged with the implementation of economic and productive development programmes.
"
8412,"In technical services, groups have been classified and job descriptions prepared for some services, but their implementation has not been so satisfactory.
"
8413,"A study will be undertaken to see how and to what extent position-oriented services can be instituted to create an effective personnel system for the present day governmental operations.

"
8425,"It has become essential, however, to check in time the possible environment of dissatisfaction among the employees, through sheer ignorance of ever growing complexity of personnel administration.

8547,"SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
"
8548,"In the process of country's development capital, labour and materials have significant roles to play, so is the role of science and technology in the modernization of the country.
"
8549,"Nepal being a small country, scientific and technical proficiency inherent in our country is almost know, knowledge of our latent capacity is important to know also from the standpoint of information as to the areas of technologies we have to import from other countries.
"
8550,"We have to deliberate on the types of technology we import. No matter traditional or modern, we must have the knowledge of machineries of the technology and their component and their operations. If we also possess the capacity to repair them in case of breakdowns, we won't have to face the difficulties due to these machineries for development.
"
8551,"Even among technologies, cast and benefits are of short and long term durations wand worth our attention . In a predominantly agricultural county like , technological development should directly benefit the peasants class.
"
8552,"In researches on other sectors, too, there should be frequent interactions between the researchers or innovators and actual users.
"
8553,"This way results from the researchers or innovators and actual user.
"
8554,"This way results from the researches would be such that could be utilized for the development words. The country today faces difficulties in various areas, and research regarding their science and technology aspects is to be conducted.
"
8555,"However, in view of the economic capability of the country the research and only to be limited to critical areas.
"
8556,"If the research were not oriented to certain addition, programmes in these plan should be so formulated that they support determined national level policies of the Seventh Plan.
"
8557,"Achievement of the sixth Plan
"
8558,"Though area of science3 and technology was accorded a separate place only from the Sixth plan, one or other kind of work in this area had been taking place for the last six decades.
"
8559,"Within last 25 to 30 years some educational and training organisations in the field of science and technology, organisations dedicated to the survey and analysis of country's means and resources, infrastructures, research laboratories and policy making bodies have been set up in the ;process of country's socio-economic development.
"
8560,"With these programmes long dependence on foreign countries for the training of medium and high level technicians has been curtailed and high level manpower in some scientific and technological fields is being produced within the country.
"
8561,"Collection of analytical statistics about some means and resources of the country had been accomplished.
"
8562,"Similarly works have been started to arouse people's consciousness in science and technology.
"
8563,"Thought some efforts had been made to some extent in the country by various organisations in the field of science and technology, may more efforts are, of course, still to be done in this direction.
"
8564,"In the review of the efforts and achievements in the country made in this short duration, some thought provoking issues and a few problems have cropped up.
"
8565,"In the talk and discussion programmes mainly following issues have been raised: development and application of science and technology has yet to help raise production and productivity and an appropriate relations still to be developed between the researchers and the users; reliable analytical data regarding country's means and resources is still to be made available; and in no-industrialization of the country, the continuing supply situation of necessary technologies in almost all sectors of development through imprecation, and without choice, evaluation and their modifications.
"
8566,"Keeping in view of this situation in science and technology, Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST) established in November 1982 with a mandate of integrated development and extension of science and technology has been conducting programmes of national laboratory development, research and development promotion of science and technology, infrastructure for science and technology etc. since its inception.
"
8567,"Similarly, National Council for Science and Technology instituted in 1975 began to integrate and implement programmes of science and technology and thereby coordinate them with the process of country's development. Subsequently in the Sixth Plan it had been conducting, under the programme of appropriate technology development and extension, policy research & studies in various areas like agriculture, forestry, industry, power, construction materials that contribute to the basic needs fulfillment of the general public.
"
8568,"Under survey and research of natural resources, survey of different natural resources (like cereal crops, building construction, solar energy) that are likely to fulfil the basic needs of the people.
"
8569,"Under the choice of technology and evaluation system development programmes, evaluation of traditional industrial technologies, study of specialty of local equipment applicable in various productive areas, and choice and evaluation of foreign technologies that are in need of country's development are being carried out in addition to this, books on various aspects of science and technology have been published.
"
8570,"Objectives of the Seventh Plan
"
8571,"Compatible with the overall development objective of the country, objective will be to aid in raising the standard of living of the people through the maximum and better use of the country's means, resources and skills through the medium of science and technology and by meeting the basic needs requirements of the people .
"
8572,"Policies
"
8573,"Programmes
"
8574,"Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology and National Council of Sicence and Technology will implement national level policies of science and technology.

8578,"Aims of these laboratories arte to aid in the activities of governmental and non-governmental organizations, practical works of higher level science students and also in its own research programme of the Academy.
"
8579,"In addition to this, these will also contribute to the supply of basic needs requirement, savings in the foreign exchange, development of modern technology, transfer of appropriate technology (modification of imported technology to local conditions) and capacity enhancement of science and technology.
"
8580,"Stress will also be laid on strengthening the existing ones while setting up such laboratories.
"
8581,"2. Under research and development, scientific and technological studies and research on different areas like chemical fertilizers, bio-fertilizers will be conducted and integration in these works set up.
"
8582,"Such schemes have great significance in the context of the declining productivity of the land when Nepal is a predominantly agricultural country.
"
8583,"Research will be so conducted that will enable to mainly fulfil the short them and long0term national requirements. '
"
8584,"3. Under promotion and motivation programme, various activities like publicity will be undertaken to familiarize science and technology in the general public.
"
8585,"4. Necessary steps will be taken for dissemination of national and international information and knowledge on science and technology.

"
8592,"POPULATION
"
8593,"In order to strike out a balance between gross domestic production and population, to raise the per capita income in proportion to the growth in GDP and thereby, to upgrade the standard of living of the nesses it is utmost necessary to regulate the population growth in a planned manner.
"
8594,"Efforts to thrash out a balance between increasing population and economic development in the country were initiated since the Third period with the implementation of family planning programme. However, the past efforts and studies made in the field of population have pointed out to the bare necessity of intersectional and multi-dimensional approach in connection with the regularization of population growth, besides family planning.
"
8595,"Accordingly, population policy with intersectional approach was first evolved in the fifth plan, but in the Sixth Plan, along with the population policy, population programmes were formulated with intersectoral approach, and implemented integrally with other sectoral programmes.
"
8596,"Special efforts were made on the population front in the Sixth plan to curb the present unprecedented growth of population in .
"
8597,"National Commission on population that has existed as a central Level Organisation to formulate population policy and to oversee the implementation of population programmes in confirmity with the national development objectives and policies, has been reorganized.
"
8598,"Achievements of population -related programmes under National Commission on population and different ministries/departments in the Sixth plan are mentioned below.
"
8599,"According to the aim of the Sixth plan to educate about the population growth and its impact on different target classes and groups of people through population information, education and communication, seminars, newsletters, analysis of research articles and reports, radio information, video move show etc. have been conducted.
"
8600,"Taking into account of the favourable impact, the women's development has on the success of the population control measures, pilot education programme along with scholarship was implemented in order to increase the number of female students in Kalikot, Jumla and Mugu district under women education programme. Similarly prize to schools enrolling more femal student at primary levels have been arranged in 4 zones and training programme for women's employment conducted in Jhapa district.
"
8601,"In tune with the Sixth plan's set objective of integration population and development due to the unfavorable impact of population growth on development, population programmes multipurpose pilot projects and training have been implemented in various productive sectors.
"
8602,"In addition to this computer analysis of population statistics has started for the dependable analysis of population data. according to the objective ot monitoring progress of fvarious population programme and of institutional development and strengthening of evaluation system of the Sixth plan, progress monitoring and evaluation project has been implemented.
"
8603,"In addition, trainigs, seminars and studies on population have been conducted.
"
8604,"In view of the impact, the internal and international migration have on population growth, detailed study on migration has been completed and report with recommendations published.
"
8605,"For the control of population it was targeted to provide family planning service to 900,000 couples in the Sixth Plan.

8606,"Family planning and Maternal Child Health project, the main organization of family planning services, Integrated Community Health Services and Nepal Family Planning Association had provided family planning services to a total of 1,503,035 couples of which permanent serves were provided to 1,227,839 couple.
"
8607,"According to the targets of the Sixth Plan, population education were imparted through the Panchayat Training Centre, the labour Department, the Sajha, the Cooperatives and the Ministry of Education and Culture.
"
8608,"In order to know the exact condition of country's population vital registration system was to be extended to additional 29 districts according o the target of the Sixth Plan, it was extended, however, to only 19 districts to make it more effective.
"
8609,"Background of the Seventh Plan
"
8610,"On projcetion of population on the basis of 1981 census, if no programme of fertility reduction were impllemented, population of Nepal would register 26.4 million after seventeen years or by the year 2000 and by 2030 this is estimated to increase to 72.3 million as this unprecedented population growth has every likelihood of having unfavorable impact on agriculture, forests, education, drinking water facility, employment and thereby on the very development process, inclusion of population control and multisectoral approach for it in the system of Nepal's development has become more pertinent.
"
8611,"According to the long term perspective of national population policy adopted to control population growth, demographic targets of zero growth rate by the year 2030. On assumption of 's population of 25.1 million by that time, reduction of total fertility rate (TFR) to the replacement level or TFR 2.5 by the year 2000 is envisaged.
"
8612,"Population policy and programmes in the Seventh plan are guided by these long term policies and programmes.

"
8656,"VITAL REGISTRATION SYSTEM
"
8657,"Population Censuses, population sample survey and registration of vital events as births, deaths and personal event are the main sources of demographic statistics.
"
8658,"Though censuses are the main source to-date to derive demographic data, vital registration system has been introduced since the Fifth Plan to assist in this area. As vital population events are recorded everyday in this vital registration system, data from this source are up-to- date and provides an important basis to make the censuses taken every decade more reliable.
"
8659,"Achievement of the Sixth Plan
"
8660,"Till the end of the fifth plan, vital registration had been introduced to additional 28 districts.
"
8661,"While the target in the Sixth plan was to extend this programme to additional 29 districts, it was introduced in 12 additional districts in the second and third years of the plan period.
"
8662,"Towards the progress of registration in the Sixth plan period, 17 percent of the crude births, only 10 percent of crude deaths were registered and marriage, divorce and migration are registered in insignificant number.
"
8663,"With a view to run this programme more effectively, efforts were directed to make it more effective than to extend to additional districts in the remaining years of the Sixth Plan.
"
8664,"Accordingly, special programme was conducted in 50 wards of 25 Panchayats of 10 districts selected on the basis of sampling, from among the districts with vital registration system.
"
8665,"Objectives, policy and programmes of vital registration in the Seventh Plan are as follows.
"
8666,"Objectives
"
8667,"To obtain the factual information of changes in the structure of population through the systematic collection and analysis of personal events as births, death, marriage, migration, divorce etc.
"
8668,"Policy 1. As events like births, deaths, marriage, migration, divorce are significant locally and from the viewpoint of the nation, local panchayats will be mobilised in order to extend the registration of such events and make it more effective.
"
8669,"2. In order to arouse maximum of consciousness about the contribution of vital events, Panchayate, class organizations, social unions and associations also will be motivated and mobilized.
"
8670,"Strategies
"
8671,"1. Vital registration system will be made more effective and extensive.
"
8672,"2. Present legal basis will be modified and amended as needed to make the registration more effective so that vital registration can also become a legal compulsion
"
8673,"Programme:
"
8674,"This programme started in 1977/78 and since then was implemented in 40 districts till the end of the Sixth Plan.
"
8675,"Under this registration of births, deaths and other personal events continued, study and modification of programme implementation continued, and tabulation and analysis o statistics undertaken.
"
8676,"To make the demographic data from the system more reliable, present registration of births, deaths and vital events will be developed into local level programme in the seventh plan.
"
8677,"As necessary demographic statistics also can be obtained from this source of process to formulate district and Panchayat level programmes in accordance with the decentralization plan, registration system will be implemented gradually as an integral part of village panchayat programmes in all districts of the kingdom.
"
8678,"Enlisting maximum participation this registration system will be made effective.
"
8679,"For the conceptual change of mind of the masses for the registration of vital events, legal bindings will bwe introduced for the issue of relationship certificates, citizenship, certificates, for enrolment of children in schools, for sale and distribution of land etc. on the basis of registration of vital events as births, deaths etc.
"
8680,"For the monitoring and supervision of the registration system, monitoring and evaluation of activities of a district will be conducted, the problems there in studied and solved, and the system gradually consolidated.
"
8681,"Budget
"
8682,"For the registration programme of births, deaths and vital events, Rs 6.4 million has been allocated in the Seventh plan

"
8684,"SOCIAL WELFARE
"
8685,"For the uplift and welfare of the socially and economically weak sections of people, of different regions, social welfare programme has an important role in fostering development through the implementation of appropriate programmes and on the basis of the principle of social justice.
"
8686,"Social welfare programmes can on the one hand arouse people's consciousness in uprooting social crimes, superstitions and malpractices and in discouraging exhibitory trends in social dealings, on the other can also offer social protection to the weak and the helpless in the social protection to the weak and the helpless in the society and provide concrete support to enable them to live on their own.
"
8687,"Along with the government organization, active involvement of the social associations and societies and mobilization of local labour and resources and significant in themselves in th social welfare activities. As such with an objective of activating different organizations involved in different aspects of social welfare, stress will be given to coordinated development of social welfare sector in the Seventh Plan.
"
8688,"Social Welfare programmes will be implemented under the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in the government sector and under social Services National Coordination council in the non government sector.
"
8689,"Government Sector Achievement of the Sixth Plan
"
8690,"Social Welfare activities were being conducted in the country through different government offices and other organizations. With an objective of large scale operation of these programmes, Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was instituted in the second year of the Sixth Plan .
"
8691,"After the institution of the ministry, various social welfare activities have been incorporated and implemented in the government sector since the F.Y 1981/82.
"
8692,"Of the programmes implemented in the Sixth Plan under the Ministry of labour and social Welfare, Programmes of job-training social security career development, group marriages, survey, seminar and women's welfare are the main ones.
"
8693,"Under the social security career development programme, 430 students studying in the schools of traditional tribes as Koche, Meche Chapang, Chhantel, Jirel, Gaine, etc. have been awarded scholarships In order to conduct a socio -economic study of backward and weak sections of the society and submit recommendations to alleviate their living conditions, socio -economic studies of Raute, Majhi(fishermen), Dum and others have been conducted.
"

8708,"1. Consolidation and Expansion of Social Welfare Centres ;
"
8709,"Social welfare homes are being run in Taulihawa, Fajbifaj and Birgunj for the management of shelter and fooding of the helpless, crippled and the disabled persons of the society.
"
8710,"In past years efforts were initiated to strengthen these centers.
"
8711,"These will be continued in the Seventh Plan, too.
"
8712,"In addition, education and job related training will be arranged for physical and mental development of the children in those social welfare centers in the Seventh plan.
"
8713,"Due to the difficult economic condition of the country many aged people have to go hungry and suffer in their old ages. As such, free food is being distributed to 200 old people at panch Dewal.
"
8714,"In the Seventh Plan, those 200 helpless old people living at panch Dewal without any supporters will be shifted to an appropriate place with minimum of facilities.
"
8715,"Similarly, a feasibility study will be undertaken to set up an old age home with payment of fees, in the form of welfare homes for the aged women.
"
8716,"Since the F.Y. 1983/84 women welfare home was run with the objectives of providing shelter, of importing vocational training vocational training to the socially displaced women and making them productive citizens.

"
8864,"1. to give priority to the development of the agriculture sector,

"
8869,"6. to improve the absorptive capacity of the economy, and
"
8870,"7. to control population growth rate.
"
8871,"The objectives set in the Sixth Plan are long-term ones. They stand as much valid to day as they did then.
"
8872,"Six development plans have been completed in the process of all-round development of the country.
"
8873,"Implementation of the Sixth Plan began with the fiscal year 1980/81 ending by the close of FY 1984/85. 
"
8874,"An attempt is made in the present chapter to assess the achievements and the kinds of problems faced in the implementation of the Sixth Plan.
"
8875,"The main objective of plan evaluation is to identify the main constraints in the process of implementation of the plan so that they are not further repeated. 
"
8876,"Such a review helps identify the strengths (the successes) as well as failures in plan implementation. 
"
8877,"This helps us to identify policies and sectoral programmes that are warranted of the economy in subsequent future.  
"
8878,"The objectives of the Sixth Plan were set against the background of the principal economic problems prevailing then in the country and in consideration of the earlier constraints in plan implementation. 
"
8879,"And with the view to make development objectives mom realistic, the following objectives were set for the Sixth Plan.
"
8880,"Extensive poverty is the main problem of the economy. 
"
8881,"And increasing production is the only solution for gradual removal of prevailing poverty from the country. 
"
8882,"An attempt is made in this chapter to assess the changes that have been brought about in the process of the implementation of set objectives and policies during the Sixth Plan. 
"
8883,"The analysis is based on actual figures of the first four years and estimates for the fifth year of the Plan period.
"
8884,"GDP, Investment and Saving
"
8885,"Gross domestic product increased at the rate of 2.30 percetnt only during the Fifth Plan period.
"
8886,"Against the backdrop of the existing population growth rate, the target growth rate of GDP was set at 4.3 percent during the Sixth Plan. 
"
8887,"In order to attain this growth rate, targets were set to increase agricultural production by 3.20 percent and that of the non-agricultural sector by 5.60 percent.
"
8888,"As population growth rate was assumed at 2.30 percent, per capita income was assumed to increase at 2.00 percent annually.
"
8889,"While GDP decreased during FY 1979/80 due to adverse weather conditions, it increased abnormally by 8.30 percent in FY 1980/81 i.e. the first year of the Sixth Plan. 
"
8890,"It increased again by 3.80 percent in FY 1981/82. M FY 1982/83.
"
8891,"There was a decline in total production by 1.4 percent due to fall in agriculture production because of drought. 
"
8892,"In FY 1983/84, weather conditions improved and national product increased by 7.40 percent. 
"
8893,"In the last year of the Sixth Plan period i.e. FY 1984/85 weather condition remained normal and GDP is expected to increase by 4.00 percent. 
"
8894,"Thus the average growth rate of national, product in the Sixth Plan has been estimated to be 4.40 percent. 
"
8895,"During this period, growth rate of the agricultural sector has been estimated at 4.70 percent and that for non-agricultural sector at 4.00 percent. 
"
8896,"Against the growth rate of population by 2.66 per cent, per capita is estimated to have increased by 1.70 percent. 
"
8897,"Total population is expected to be 16.686 million by mid-July 1985 as against 14.633 million in mid-July 1980.
"
8898,"It is clear from the foregoing explanations that the agriculture sector has a major role to play for the increase of overall GDP. 
"
8899,"And even until now, agricultural production depends mainly on weather. 
"
8900,"Because irrigation facilities are not yet available on an extensive scale, improved method of cultivation has remained limited, resulting in low agricultural production.
"
8901,"Looking at the structure of GDP, it could be observed that substantial change has taken place in the pattern of the economy. 
"
8902,"The table below shows that the economy is still heavily dependent on agriculture. 
"
8903,"Since there was no progress in the non-agricultural sector as expected, no meaningful change has taken place in the structure, of the economy. 
"
8904,"In FY 1979/80 the contribution of agriculture to. GDP at constant prices stood at 59. 00 percent, This has remained so in FY 1984/85.
"
8905,"Progress Review of the Sixth Plan
"
8906,"The progress made during the Sixth Plan in the development of rope-line, railways and other means of transportation is given below:
"
8907,"Under the ropeway strengthening and development programme, the strengthening of the 42 km Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway is expected to be complete per target. 
"
8908,"However there has been no progress in the construction of Surkhet-Dailekh ropeway project. 
"
8909,"Similarly the work envisaged to construct rural ropeway in the hilly region is likely to remain incomplete. 
"
8910,"Under the railway strengthening and development programme, the 53 km Jayanagar-Janakpur-Bijalpur railway is expected to be completed. 
"
8911,"But regarding the feasibility study for the proposed railway development programme related to Jogbani-Biratnagar, Nautanawa-Bhairahawa-Butwal and Rupaidia-Nepalgunj, only preliminary study could be completed. 
"
8912,"Feasibility study was undertaken to review Birgunj-Amlekhgunj railway and to convert Birgunj Raxual section to a suitable gauge system.
"
8913,"Concerning the expansion of electric powered trolley bus services, the target was to carry out necessary improvement on the 12.73 km Kathmandu-Bhaktapur trolley bus rout and extend the bus route from Suryabinayak of Bhaktpur to Shahid Gate Ratnapark and Tribhuvan University in Kirtipur.
"
8914,"During the plan period only some arrangements were made to initiate works on Tripureshwar-Shahidgate section. 
"
8915,"Feasibility study was proposed to introduce trolley bus services in Biratnagar-Dharan, Bhairahawa Butwal and other highways. Only preliminary studies could be initiated.
"
8916,"Concerning the development of urban transportation system, bus terminals and waiting stands were constructed in and 30 buses were obtained for Nepal Transport Corporation. 
"
8917,"Under the waterways development programme, the target was to carry out detailed economic and technical studies on the major rivers like the Koshi and Narayani to use them as waterways but only preliminary study has been completed and potential points for the waterways system have been identified on the Koshi, Narayani and Karnali rivers.
"
8918,"The target for introducing modern boat services on the Narayani river for the safe and regular traffic is likely to require more time. 
"
8919,"Concerning the development of containerized transportation services, some container trucks were made available to Nepal Transport Corporation.
"
8920,"The meagre achievement as against the target and programme was due to weakness in internal administration on the one hand and the limited technical know-how in the development of most of these transportation means on the other.
"
8921,"1)  Systematize and regulate transit system of the kingdom.
"
8922,"2)  Gradually develop and strengthen other means of transportation like ropeways, railways and water ways.
"
8923,"3)  Systematize public transportation services.
"
8924,"Policies:
"
8925,"The following policies will be pursued to fulfill the above objectives during the Seventh Plan: 
"
8926,"1) Internal transportation development programmes related to  transit services will be conducted in an integrated manner.
"
8927,"2) To accord priority to explore cooperation from the neighbouring country in order to carry out feasibility study and construction of broad gauge rail links to port from one of the suitable customs offices from the viewpoint of import and export.
"
8928,"3) Initiate necessary measures to develop containerized transport services especially to help move goods in trade with the third countries.
"
8929,"4) In order to reduce the costly import of petroleum products which are largely used for transportation purposes, the policy of gradually developing and expanding electric power based transportation system such as ropeway, trolley bus services and others will be continued.
"
8930,"5) The programme for inland river transportation system in the major rivers will be continued. 
"
8931,"And the possibility for utilizing external waterways system will also be explored.
"
8932,"6) Rules concerning public transportation system will be reviewed in order to unify the service conditions of the public transportation system and ensure better service and safety to the public. Private sector will be encouraged to play more active role in this regard. 
"
8933,"The role of Nepal Transport Corporation will be gradually restricted.
"
8934,"7) Necessary reforms will be effected in various departments and and corporations related to other transport development system on the basis of structureal studiies. 
"
8935,"Steps will be taken to construct gravity ropeways in the hill areas, in a manner suitable to help transport necessary goods in related district. 
"
8936,"Policies will be adopted to mobilize private enterpreneurs to develop ropeway transportation.
"
8937,"Working Policies
"
8938,"The following working policies will be adopted during the Seventh Plan to strengthen the stated objectives and policies:
"
8939,"1) Necessary measures will be taken to utilize the full capacity and improve service conditions of rail, ropeway and trolley bus services being operated under Nepal Transport Corporation.
"
8940,"2) Agencies responsible for transport system development will be strenghtened and activized in order to develop ropeway, railway and other public transportation  system  and  organise  them systematically.
"
8941,"3) More private sectoral investment will be encouraged in public transportation service, especially in the bus services. 
"
8942,"Necessary reforms will be made on provisions like road permit. 
"
8943,"In urban areas, public transporttation services will be emphasised along with other steps according overall urbanization plans and programmes.
"
8944,"4) Priority will be given to conduct studies on the development of inter model containerization to strengthen transit facilities for foreign trade. 
"
8945,"If found suitable, steps will be taken to set up container port station on  side along Nepal-India border.
"
8946,"5) Emphasis will be given to develop physical facilities in and around customs region of Birgunj and Biratnagar to strengthen foreign trade.
"
8947,"6) Various steps will be taken to develop internal waterways system. 
"
8948,"Studies will be conducted to introduce improved boats on experimental basis in some rivers. 
"
8949,"Coordination will be maintained between the Ministries of work and Transport and Water Resources in order to formulate concrete programmes in waterways development and their gradual implementation.
"
8950,"Programmes
"
8951,"In view of the stated objectives and policies of the Seventh Plan, the programmes for other transport development are presented under the following headings:
"
8952,"a) Construction, Expansion and Strengthening of Ropeways:
"
8953,"Ropeway was first introduced in the year 1928 with 22.5 km stretch of Dhorsing-Mata Tirtha ropeway which was extended up to Teku in 1947. 
"
8954,"After the initiation of the planned development effort, the old ropeway was displaced by the 42.14 km ropeway stretch from Hetauda to Kathmandu. 
"
8955,"The designed capacity of this ropeway according to the Ycable system is 28 tonne per hour. 
"
8956,"The ropeway is operated by Nepal Transport Corporation and its improvement and strengthening programme has been started since the Fifth Plan period. 
"
8957,"The remaining work included in the Sixth Plan will be completed during the Seventh Plan. 
"
8958,"Besides, steps will be taken to increase the capacity of existing Kathmandu-Hetauda ropeway and extend it upto Amlekhgunj, if found feasible. 
"
8959,"Private transport organization will be encouraged to play active role in the mobilization of investment cost for this programme. 
"
8960,"Study reports on ropeway construction in major areas of the country will be reviewed and necessary steps will be taken for their implementation, if found feasible. 
"
8961,"Alternative programmes like ropeway are also envisaged in some hilly areas to transport goods.
"
8962,"(b) Railwuay Strengthening and Study
"
8963,"Railways was introduced in 1928 with the establishment of Raxaul-Amlekhgunj railway. 
"
8964,"Of this, only 8 km stretch from Raxaul to Birgunj is presently in operation. 
"
8965,"The 53 km Janakpur-Jayanagar and Janakpur-Bijalpura railway plying in Nepal-India border was started in 1935 and is now being operated by Nepal Transport Corporation. 
"
8966,"The Fifth Plan initiated strengthening work on this railway which will be completed during the Seventh Plan through Nepal Transport Corporation. 
"
8967,"Further studies will be conducted to revive Raxaul-Birgunj line in accordance with the preliminary study.
"
8968,"(c) Trolley Bus Extension and Study
"
8969,"The first electric powerd Trolley Bus was introduced in 1975/76. 
"
8970,"The Fifth Plan saw the completion of 13 km Kathmandu-Bhaktapur Trolley Bus line. 
"
8971,"It is in operation at present.
"
8972,"As the trolley bus transportation services are based on electric power generated within the country, the policy has been adopted to gradually introduce such services in major urban areas of the kingdom. 
"
8973,"Therefore, Kathmandu-Bhaktapur trolley bus line in valley will be extended from Tripureshwor to Shahidgate, Tinkune-Chabahil- Thapathali to Patan gate during the Seventh Plan period. 
"
8974,"In addition to this, feasibility study will be conducted construct trolley bus line between Biratnagar and Dharan and Bhairahawa-Butwal. 
"
8975,"A master plan of trolley bus service will be drawn up to develop trolley bus services.
"
8976,"(d) Development of Public Transportation Services:
"
8977,"Public bus and truck services play important role in the general transportation system. 
"
8978,"As such, appropriate rules will be framed to encourage private sector involvement in order to systematise development of public transportation services and ensure better and safe facilities to the people. 
"
8979,"Concrete projects will be undertaken to develop bus terminals for the long distance bus routes. 
"
8980,"Terminal construction will be carried out on the basis of  formulated projects.
"
8981,"e) Containerized Transport System
"
8982,"According to the provisions of Nepal-India Trade and Transit Treaty, the imported goods from the third countries via Calcutta port are transported to Nepal through contianer trucks.
"
8983,"Keeping this in mind, studies will be conducted regarding inetr model containerized transport system and suitable projects will be formulated and steps will be considered as needed.
"
8984,"f) Development of Waterways:
"
8985,"Most of the rivers in Nepal have perennial flow as they originate in the Himalayas. 
"
8986,"The preliminary studies conducted during the previous plan periods have shown that waterways development can be feasible in the terai segment of the Sapta Koshi in the East, the Narayani in the Central region, and the Karnali river in the Far west. 
"
8987,"It was observed that access to the Terai was feasible through these routes. 
"
8988,"It is estimated that the development of waterways will reduce transport cost of goods and incur less investment on the cost of infrastructure. 
"
8989,"Keeping this in mind, detailed economic and technical studies will be conducted in some segments of these major rivers like the Koshi and Narayani during the Plan period. 
"
8990,"Necessary follow-up action will also be undertaken in the rivers deemed feasible for water transport development.
"
8991,"Passanger boat services by tbe private sector to the Narayani river from Deughat to Indian border often result into various accidents due to the lack of minimum safety measures and the use of old dugout boats. 
"
8992,"Therefore, studies will be conducted during the current plan period on the techniques of improved boat services to strengthen private sector services.
"
8993,"Financial Outlay
"
8994,"A total of Rs 25.80 million has been allocated to implement the above mentioned projects during the Seventh Plan.
"
8995,"AIR TRANSPORT
"
8996,"As a large area of the country consists of high mountains, roads and other means of transport remain scarce and in this context air transport assumes a special significance.
"
8997,"Construction of airfields in various mountains and remote districts has provided the foundation of modern air transport development. 
"
8998,"Before the Sixth Plan, 39 airfields were in operation throughout the kingdom. 
"
8999,"Of these only 12 were located in the terai and the rest of 27 (69 percent of the total) were in the hills and Himalayan region.
"
9000,"However, air services could not be made regular and reliable because most of the small airfields consisted of only runways; there were no other physical and communications facilities. 
"
9001,"Keeping this in mind, the Sixth Plan emphasis ed creating physical facilities in the existing airfields rather than construct new airfields in order to make the domestic air services more regular and reliable. 
"
9002,"Special stress was given to develop the Tribhuvan airport in view of its significance as a link to the international air service. 
"
9003,"Guided by the policy of overcoming transportation bottlenecks in promoting tourism and foreign trade through domestic and international air services, air transport is being developed in the country.
"
9004,"The following table illustrates the growth of airport construction from the First Plan (1956/57) to the fourth year of the Sixth Plan (1983/84) and the number of airports in given years:
"
9005,"
"
9006,"Before the introduction of the planned development efforts, there were no air services in the hill districts; following the initiation of the planned development, air services have been steadily expanded in the hilly and remote regions as well. 
"
9007,"By the last year (1979/80) of the Fifth Plan, 39 airfields, both with concrete and grass runways, were constructed in the country and the number of airfields reached 41 by 1983/84, the fourth year of the Sixth Plan.
"
9008,"The number of airfields by the development region is presented in the table below:
"
9009,"Promotion of air-services in the hill districts is necessitated in view of the fact that a large area of the country comprises hills and mountains where road construction involves a long time, and huge expenses. 
"
9010,"Thus, air transport development was emphasised in the hill areas where 30 airfields have already been completed compared to 12 airports in the plains of terai. 
"
9011,"Of the total airfields, 72 percent (30) are located in the hills while only 28 percent (12) are in the terai region.
"
9012,"The number of airfields in various zones and districts of the Kingdom are: Mechi zone 2, Koshi 3, Sagarmatha 6, Gandaki 3, Lumbini 1, Janakpur 3, Narayani 3, Bagmati 2, Dhaulagiri 3, Rapti 3, Bheri 2, Karnali 3, Seti 5 and Mahakali 2. 
"
9013,"The details of type and length of each of the airportsare given in the following table:
"
9014,"Progress Review of the Sixth Plan
"
9015,"During the Sixth Plan period, the programmes for air transport development were: 
"
9016,"to expand international air services to boost tourism development and foreign trade; 
"
9017,"develop domestic air services in the areas without road transport facilities; 
"
9018,"equip the existing airports with minimum necessary physical facilities and install navigational and communication equipment; 
"
9019,"strengthen the domestic air-services in order to make them reliable; 
"
9020,"conduct feasibility study for the alternate international airport and produce middle and low level manpower required for civil aviation within the country.
"
9021,"In consonance with the above objectives and policies, two small airfields were targeted for construction during the plan period of which one was completed by the fourth year of the project and the other one will be completed by the fiscal year of 1984/85. 
"
9022,"In addition to this, the targets were also set to construct and strengthen five airports and expand runways of five stol airfields. 
"
9023,"The achievements as per the targets are described below.
"
9024,"Under the Airport Construction and Strengthening programme, five projects were carried out in, Nepalgunj airport, Pokhara airport, Surkhet airport and Dhangadi airport. 
"
9025,"The target for project was to construct 1,200 meter runways to the north and 1045 meter to the south, 555 meter taxi way, to strengthen 16,000 square meter aircraft parking approach, completion of international terminal building and other construction works, and begin construction of domestic terminal building under the second phase programme; 
"
9026,"However, the task completed was civil works related to filling in soil for international terminal building, access road construction and landscaping. The contract documents for the construction of the international terminal building were expected to be finanlised by the last year 1984/85 of the Sixth Plan. 
"
9027,"With regard to creating additional physical facilities, the existing international terminal section was improved and expanded; boring was installed for water supply system; and construction of security guards house and firemen's dormitory was completed as per the targets.
"
9028,"However, the targets for the construction of domestic and international terminal buildings, VIP sheds, 10 km peripheral and cross roads, civil maintenance yard, and cross strip western locator building (in Dhaarke) have remained incomplete. 
"
9029,"The targets concerning the communications and navigational aids, the equipment were repaired and maintained and the designs were prepared for the transfer of navigational equipment to the newly constructed buildings. 
"
9030,"The target for constructing a huge hanger, however, has remained incomplete.
"
9031,"On the project, a feasibility study was conducted in Chhire danda for constructing a new airport and a total of 3106 ropani land was acquired and compensation paid for. 
"
9032,"But the airport construction with a runway length of 1750 meter has remained incomplete. 
"
9033,"Construction of an Avro standard airport was completed in the Nepalgunj airport project. 
"
9034,"Though blacktopping of the runway was completed, necessary correction on the faulty construction is yet to be carried out. 
"
9035,"The construction of terminal sheds, tower section, staff quarters and security guard has been completed. The construction for water supply system has begun and buildings for receiving station, transmitting station and repeater station as well as 1.5 km entry road were completed. 
"
9036,"Concerning runway fencing work, a wire fence of 2750 meter was completed. No work seems to have been done to meet the targets of the Sixth Plan concerning the construction of aircraft hanger, maintenance yard, and cargo sheds. 
"
9037,"In the Far-Western Development Region, security guard house and staff quarters were constructed and fencing laid down in the and cargo shed construction and water supplies system will remain incomplete. 
"
9038,"In the Surkhet airport project, the targets fixed were: expansion of terminal building, security guard house and staff quarters, 2500 meter concrete drainage construction, water distribution system and fencing; of this, works completed were 3000 meter concrete drainage construction, staff quarters, security guard house and water distribution system.
"
9039,"Under the provision of installing additional physical facilities the targets were fixed to construct terminal buildings at 7 airports and 17 small airfields, together with staff quarters and security guard houses, drainage system, river control, fencing, generator shed, and others. 
"
9040,"In Chandragadhi airport, drainage, fencing and yard construction were completed. 
"
9041,"In Biratnagar airport, the tasks completed were staff quarters and workshop building, fire station, cross road and water distribution system. 
"
9042,"In Tumlingtar airport, the targets were to carry out land-slide prevention works (at four sites); completion of drainage system, expansion of terminal building, construction of staff quarters and water distribution system; however, the tasks completed were land-slide control measures, concrete drainage system, expansion of terminal building and constn.1ction of staff quarters. 
"
9043,"In Rajbiraj airport, the target of errecting 15,000 feet fencing and drainage works was not completed:
"
9044,"In Janakpur airport, the targets were to strengthen runways and drainage system, water distributions ystem, generator shed construction, staff quarters, fire control station and cross road, of which only drainage and water distribution system were carried out. 
"
9045,"In Simra airport, the targets were to construct fire control station, staff quarters and remaining portion of the terminal building of which only the remaining work of terminal building was completed. In Pokhara airport (old), workshop building was completed per targets.
"
9046,"Concerning stol airfields, construction of terminal building, security guard house and staff quarters will be completed in Taplejung as per target. 
"
9047,"Similarly, at Lukla stol airfield, terminal building construction and fencing were completed; at Lamidanda stol airfield staff quarters were constructed while in Baitadi terminal building and staff quarters were constructed and a hillock facing the runways was removed.
"
9048,"At Jomsom stol airfield, staff quarters were completed while at Dolpa airfield the runway gradient was improved and terminal building completed. 
"
9049,"Likewise, staff quarters were completed at Bajhang and Rukum stol airfields. 
"
9050,"3. Agricultural Production
"
9051,"The production of major foodgrains and cash crops was expected to increase annually by 2.80 percent and 3.00 percent respectively during the Plan period, resulting in the growth of overall production at 3.00 % annually during the Sixth Plan. 
"
9052,"During the Fifth Plan period the production of cash crop increased by 1.60 percent annually while that of foodgrains decreased by 2.80 percent. 
"
9053,"This resulted in a decrease of 2.00 % annually in the total production of major crops. 
"
9054,"In the final year of the Fifth Plan, i.e., FY 1979/80, production of foodgrains decreased by 12.90 percent and that of cash crops by 8.20 percent due to adverse weather, resulting in the decline in overall production of major crops by 12.10 percent.
"
9055,"Because of favourable weather conditions, there was an increase in the production of foodgrains by 18.30 percent and that of cash crops by 5.30 percent, resulting exceptionally in an increase in the total production of major crops by 15.70 percent. 
"
9056,"Except barely in foodgrain and tobacco, jute and potato in cash crops, all the major crops recorded an increase in production in the same year. 
"
9057,"In the following years the production 6f foodgrains and cash crops recorded an increase except for foodgrains in 1982/83 and cash crops in 1983/84.
"
9058,"During the Plan period, total production of all major crops is expected to increase by 5.90 percent annually as result of the increase in foodgrains production by 6.20 percent and cash crops by 4.30 percent. 
"
9059,"The target of the Plan has been exceeded because of the exceptional increase in production in the FY 1980/81. 
"
9060,"The main causes for the decrease in production of jute during the period under review are the failing in prices of jute in the international market and the lack of remunerative prices for the jute-growers. 
"
9061,"Even then the increase of production of cash crops has exceeded the target.
"
9062,"During the Sixth Plan, except in FY 1982/83 and FY 1984/85, production of foodgrains exceeded the target of the annual increase of 2.80 percent for all years. 
"
9063,"In the FY 1982/83, foodgrain production declined by 10.20 percent because of late monsoons and inadequate precipitation. 
"
9064,"As production could increase considerably in FY 1983/84 as it did in FY 1980/81 because of decline in production in the preceding year.
"
9065,"Production of cash crops is estimated to increase by 4.30 percent annually, exceeding the set target. 
"
9066,"Production of cash crop declined only by 3.70 percent because of the unexpected decline in tin production of jute and sugarcane. 
"
9067,"In the FY 1984/85 the production of cash crops is estimated to increase compared with the preceding years. (Table 1.4)
"
9068,"Industrial Production
"
9069,"A target of 10.00 percent annual growth of industrial production was set in the Sixth Plan.
"
9070,"Production statistics of cottage industries are not available.
"
9071,"The production of major industries in the organised sector recorded a growth of 0.40 percent in FY 1980/81 and in 1.50 percent in FY 1981/82 respectively.
"
9072,"It increased by 18.40 percent and 12.00 percent in the FY l982/83 and FY 1983/84 respectively.
"
9073,"It is expected that it will increase by, 10.00 percent in FY 1984/85.
"
9074,"Thus the average growth rate of industrial production during the Plan period is estimated to be 10.30 percent.
"
9075,"The growth rate attained during the Sixth Plan period can, therefore, be considered encouraging compared with the 7.30 percent growth rate of industrial production during the Fifth Plan period.
"
9076,"The improvement in supply of power with the completion of Kulekhani hydro power project in FY 1981 and Devighat project in FY 1983, seems to have helped in the smooth operation of industries.
"
9077,"Favourable environment for the remaining of industries was possible because of lesser incidence of labour problems during these years.
"
9078,"During this period, soap, synthetic textiles, cotton textiles, cigarettes, liquor and agriculture tools registered an appreciable growth among industrial products.
"
9079,"On amount of the restrictions in the import of soaps, the production of soaps increased four fold due to adequate domestic market.
"
9080,"Due to unfavourable balance of payments situation, the issue of import licence for synthetic textiles from overseas was restricted in FY 1982/83.
"
9081,"Consequently the synthetic industries increased their production substantially, that year.
"
9082,"Among the industrial goods, production of plywood (whom production was increasing upto 1981/82) went down since 1982/83.
"
9083,"The production of stainless steel utensils (whom production went down till 1982/83) has started increasing thereafter.
"
9084,"Investment, Savings and Consumption
"
9085,"In order to achieve a minimal growth rate of 4.30% in GDP, development expenditure of Rs 33.44 billion (out of which Rs 25.75 billion would be in fixed capital formation) at constant prices of 1979/80 was, envisaged as necessary.
"
9086,"The above investment requirement is based on ICOR of 4.50:1.00. 
"
9087,"Out of the total investment it was envisaged that public sector investment would be Rs 12.30 billion with Rs 13.45 billion in the private sector.
"
9088,"Thus it was envisaged that investment (at Rs 25.75 billion in fixed capital formation) would be 18.50 percent of gross domestic product out of which 8.80 percent would be in the public sector and 9.70 percent in the private sector.
"
9089,"For this, total investment needed to increase at an annual growth rate of 16.00 percent, public sector investment at 19.40 percent and private sector investment at 13.30 percent.
"
9090,"In order to attain the target growth rate of investment, it was envisaged that national savings should increase at the annual rate of 6.50 percent and be 7.7 percent of GDP
"
9091,"The pattern of national savings and investment at current prices during the Sixth Plan period is presented in the Table 1.7.
"
9092,"In the fiscal year 1979/80 about 61.0 percent of total investment was borne by national savings and the balance by foreign savings.
"
9093,"In the fiscal year 1984/85 about 55.0 percent of total investment is met by the national savings.
"
9094,"Thus, the proportion of national savings has been declining steadily.
"
9095,"And clearly, the dependence of the economy on foreign savings is increasing for sustaining increased level of investment.
"
9096,"In the fiscal year 1982/83 the ratio of saving to investment fell to the extent of 45 percent.
"
9097,"It was an exceptional year from the point of view of production, with a decline in total production by 1.40 percent and it had its adverse effect on saving mobilisation.
"
9098,"During the Sixth Plan period, the annual average growth rate of investment at constant prices was 13.20 percent. Investment stood at 18.30 percent of GDP in FY 1979/80 and is estimated to reach 18.80 percent in FY 1984/85.
"
9099,"Although the annual growth rate of national savings stood at 11.20 percent its sham in GDP is expected to drop from 10.90 percent to 10.40 percent.
"
9100,"It is estimated that the public sector investment would attain an annual average growth rate of 19.50 percent in fixed capital formation.
"
9101,"Consumption is estimated to have increased by 12.70 percent annually.
"
9102,"Its share in GDP in FY 1979/80 stood at 88.90 percent, and is expected to increase to 89.60 percent in FY 1984/85.
"
9103,"As a whole it has not been possible to achieve substantial progress in mobilizing savings during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9104,"During this period, it was possible to mobilize as saving only 9.60 percent of additional income generated.
"
9105,"
"
9106,"Financial Situation of Government
"
9107,"It was envisaged that in order to achieve the 4.30 pereent targeted annual growth rate of GDP, public  sector development expenditure at constant prices of FY 1979/80 should be Rs 21.75 billion.
"
9108,"For this, it was estimated that development expenditure needed to increase at an annual rate of 2O.30 percent.
"
9109,"In order to maintain the desired level of development expenditures, the annual growth rate of the regular expenditure needed to be limited to 10.00 percent, increase government revenue by 12.00 percent and foreign aid by 23.20 percent on annual basis.
"
9110,"Substantial progress could not be attained in the mobilisation of revenue during the Plan period.
"
9111,"In the first year of the Plan period, i.e. FY 1980/81 revenue increased remarkably by 29.10 percent.
"
9112,"Because of adverse weather in the previous year, i.e. FY 1979/80, when revenue stood minimal, increase in revenue in FY 1980/81 was more exceptional.
"
9113,"In the second year i.e. FY 1981/82, additional increase in the revenue by 11.50 percent was recorded.
"
9114,"But in the third year i.e. FY 1982/83, because there was a decline in total production, revenue could increase only by 5.90 percent.
"
9115,"Revenue is estimated to have increased by 20.10 percent in FY 1983/84 and by 13.60 percent in FY 1984/85.
"
9116,"Thus the growth rate of revenue in the Plan period is estimated to be 15.80 percent at current prices.
"
9117,"However, on the basis of constant prices of FY 1979/80, this annual growth rate turns out to be only 5.10 percent.
"
9118,"Thus, total revenue at constant prices of FY 1970-80 reaches Rs 10.86 billion.
"
9119,"This makes 78.0% of the target of Rs 13.93 billion for the Sixth Plan period (Table 1.9) and (Table 1.10)
"
9120,"During the plan period it is estimated that tax revenue would increase to Rs 3.0991 billion from Rs. 1.5288 billion at the annual growth rate of 15.20 percent.
"
9121,"Non-tax revenue is estimated to increase to Rs 770.9 million from 330.90 million at the rat: of 18.40 percent.
"
9122,"The annual growth rate of direct taxes is estimated at 20.40 percent and that of indirect taxes at 14.00 percent, thus direct tax revenue is estimated to reach Rs 643.20 million and indirect tax revenue to Rs 2.4559 billion in FY 1984/85.
"
9123,"Income tax, sales tax, property registration tax and excise duty show fastest growth rate.
"
9124,"Export duties on several commodities have been dropped or reduced in order to encourage exports. This has led to a decline in revenue from export. 
"
9125,"Revenue from land tax also has declined bemuse of concessions accorded in land tax.
"
9126,"In the non-tax area, revenue from forest has gone down because export of timber has been restricted for forest conservation.
"
9127,"Revenue from dividends and interest has increased remarkably.
"
9128,"Increase of the import licence fees helped in increasing revenue from non-tax sources since 1983/84.
"
9129,"During the period under review steps undertaken for resource mobilization were limited to raising existing rates.
"
9130,"Rates of customs duty, excis e sales tax, excise duty etc. in indirect tax were increased.
"
9131,"In direct taxes, tax rates on urban property tax, income tax and registration tax, were raised.
"
9132,"Rates of other minor taxes, such as import hotel tax, import embarkation tax, passport and visa fees were also raised.
"
9133,"New taxes such as road and bridge maintenance tax, and building construction tax were introduced.
"
9134,"Road and bridge taxes, introduced in FY 1982/83, were in FY 1984/85.
"
9135,"The basis of some excise duties was changed from quantity to advalorem.
"
9136,"Steps were not taken to solve the basic problem of tax collection nor attempt was made to mobilize additional resources in agriculture sector. Also, procedures for tax collection, prevention of tax leakage, location and identification of tax evaders, etc. we not done.
"
9137,"Steps whatsoever were not taken for increasing revenue collection by improving the operation of the government-owned industrial and commercial organizations.
"
9138,"In the absence of these efforts, the possibility of increasing the revenue only by increasing the existing rate has increasingly narrowed down.
"
9139,"Regular expenditure has been increasing at the rate of 21.40 percent annually during the Plan period.
"
9140,"Major share of regular expenditure is accounted by other expenditure, defense and internal security.
"
9141,"Other expenditure shares 31.00 percent and defense and internal security 26.00 percent respectively in the total increase in regular expenditures.
"
9142,"The main reason for the extraordinary increase in other expenditure is the increase in salary and other facilities of the employees since 1980/81 and especially, the late Increase in salary level in 1984/85.
"
9143,"Regular, expenditure under the heading of social and other economic services has increased by 18.00 percent only.
"
9144,"These social and economic services have been receiving less priority in financial appropriate since a few years.
"
9145,"This has resulted in under utilization of capital assets due to lack of proper maintenance.
"
9146,"During this period, about 25.00 percent of regular expenditure was spent on payment of principal and interest.
"
9147,"Of the total targeted development expenditure, 30.40 percent was allocated to agriculture, irrigation and forest, 25.80 percent to industry, mining and electricity, 19.40 percent to transport and communication, 23.70 percent to social services, and 0.70 percent for miscellaneous.
"
9148,"Expenditure target was achieved in none of the heading under development expenditure except under the miscellaneous.
"
9149,"Expenditure on agriculture, irrigation and forest, and industry, mining and electricity attained 66.00 percent and 60.40 percent of the target respectively. In transport and communication, and social services, they stood at 71.10 percent and 86.00 percent respectively.
"
9150,"Low investment on electricity resulted in reduced expenditure on industry, mining and electricity.
"
9151,"Under the sub-sector of electricity, large electricity projects did not take off and the progress of on-going projects (under construction) was very slow. Therefore, investment stood very low as against the target in this sector.
"
9152,"In the field of irrigation, some bigger irrigation projects did not materialize resulting in low investment.
"
9153,"Of the total development expenditure of Rs 22.00 billion at current prices during the Sixth Plan, about Rs 4.8652 billion (22.10 %) was met by revenue surplus, Rs 11.2310 (51.10%) by foreign aid, and Rs 5.9038 billion (26.80 %) by deficit financing (Table 1.17).
"
9154,"Deficit finance increased significantly after the first year.
"
9155,"In the first year, total deficit finance stood at Rs 0.1297 billion. It increased to Rs 0.9623 billion in the second year, to Rs 2.0678 billion in the third year, to Rs 1.39941 billion in the fourth year, and Rs 1.3500 billion in the fifth year.
"
9156,"Revenue surplus could not increase proportionately with the increase in development expenditure. So, deficit finance started increasing.
"
9157,"Revenue surplus at constant price stood at 58.10 percent of the target.
"
9158,"The percentage of deficit finance in internal resource was fixed at 27.50 percent. But it seems to have increased up to 53.20 percent.
"
9159,"This change has adversely affected the balance of payment and price stabilisation objectives of the Plan. Foreign aid at current prices increased by 20.00 percent per annum during the Plan period.
"
9160,"While 61.00 of the development Expenditure was targeted to be met by foreign aid (gross), 50.90 percent was actually so met.
"
9161,"Calculated at constant prim, foreign aid could increase at 9.00 percent only against, the target of 23.20 percent.
"
9162,"Non-availbility of the foreign aid is not the cause of this under-utilisation of foreign aid. 
"
9163,"Slow and ineffective execution of foreign aided projects - the main muse for this under-utilization of already committed foreign aid.
"
9164,"A seemingly incongruous situation is observed with both resorting to deficit finance in meeting expenditure on the one hand and under-utilization of available foreign aid on the other.
"
9165,"At Sanphe Bagar and Dipayal airfields, the construction of staff quarters was in progress as per the target.
"
9166,"Similarly, the target of completing staff quarters and security guard houses at Rolpa (Badachaur) stol airfield looks like to remain incomplete.
"
9167,"However, at Manang and Humla airfields, the construction of terminal building will remain incomplete. Under the Stol airfield construction, improvement and expansion programme, the target was to construct two new airfields in Bajura (Kunakalti) and Darchula (Gokuleshwar) of which one was completed the other was likely to have completed by the end of fiscal year 1984/85.
"
9168,"Of the existing stol airfields, runway improvement was planned in five airfields at Phaplu, Baglung, Jumla, Ramechhap and Lamtang, of this runway expansion was completed at Phaplu, Ramechhap and Lamtang.
"
9169,"Similarly, runway expansion work was done at Baglung and Jumla airfields.
"
9170,"In addition to this, runway expansion was carried out at Rumjatar (Okhaldhunga), Suketar (Taplejung) and Marse (Bhojpur) stol airfields which was not envisaged under the plan.
"
9171,"Concerning the expansion of communications and navigational aids, TMASIS and approach light were acquired for Biratnagar and Bhairahawa airports as envisaged under the plan, though they are yet to be installed; the plan for creating a western locator beak on in the Far-Western Development Region was carried out in Chamire Danda installing equipment for a repeater station and flight equipment service (FIC) were fitted in the operation tower at Nepalgunj airport.
"
9172,"Similarly, under the communications and navigational aids for the stol airfields programme, installation of equipment were fitted at Rolpa airfield.
"
9173,"Regarding the targets for installing solar and wind powered communications equipment, contract arrangements have been made to obtain necessary equipment for 15 different airports.
"
9174,"Under the fire control and life saving services the plan envisaged acquiring a large foam tender fire engine, a large water tender (fire engine), ambulance and disaster relief medicines for  and one foam tender (fire engine) each for Biratnagar, Bhairahawa and Nepalgunj and no progress was recorded in this regard.
"
9175,"Under the miscellaneous heading, the plan was to complete the feasibility study for the construction of an alternate international airport of which only preliminary study was carried out.
"
9176,"During the last four years, the civil aviation training centre provided A. T. C. training to 24 persons, basic communication officer's training for 40 persons, and electronics maintenance training for 27 persons.
"
9177,"Similarly, 78 persons were given fire control and life saving training and 41 persons received refresher training in fire control system.
"
9178,"Thus, during the first four years of the plan, altogether 210 persons were provided training.
"
9179,"Most of the work as envisaged under the civil aviation safety and information services project regarding installation and strengthening of flight information services were carried out in 20 airfields.
"
9180,"During this period, economic and technical surveys were also carried out in various airports and airfields.
"
9181,"Monetary and Credit Situation
"
9182,"It was aimed that the growth of money supply would be limited within the rate of 12.00 percent per annum in order to contain inflation within a predetermined range and to maintain equlibrium in the balance of payment situation in the Sixth Plan.
"
9183,"In this process, it laid emphasis on the utilisation of the credit monitoring instruments available with Nepal Rastra Bank and keeping the deficit finance within narrow limits.
"
9184,"The rate of growth of money supply in the first, second and fourth years of the Plan followed more or less the set targets respectively.
"
9185,"In these years, money supply increased by 13.30 percent (Rs 0.3774 billion), 12.60 percent (Rs 0.4037 billion) and 13.40 percent (Rs, 0.15826 billion) respectively.
"
9186,"But in the third year of the Plan, money supply increased substantially by 20.40 percent (Rs 0.7374 billion).
"
9187,"Money supply is estimated to increase by 12.40 percent (Rs 0.6226 billion) in the final year of the Plan i.e. FY 1984/85.
"
9188,"Thus, the average rate of increase of money supply is estimated to reach 14.40 percent in the Plan, superseding the set target.
"
9189,"The principal reason for the money supply exceeding the target in the Sixth Plan is the deteriorating budgetary situation of His Majesty's Government.
"
9190,"His Majesty's Government started borrowing heavily from the banking sector from the second year of Plan. 
"
9191,"Borrowings by His Majesty's Government that year increased by 63 percent over the previous year.
"
9192,"In the third year, it increased still more by 98.00 percent.
"
9193,"In the fourth year of the plan, it increased by 23.00 percent only and by 18.00 percent in the fifth year.
"
9194,"Thus borrowing by His Majesty's Government increased by 36.00 percent on average during the five years.
"
9195,"During the five year period under review, borrowings by public corporations increased yearly by 7.10 % only.
"
9196,"Such borrowing increased remarkably in the first and third years of the Plan but it declined in the second and fourth years, and is estimated to decrease further in the fifth year.
"
9197,"Credit to the private sector in the first year increased by 30.00 percent.
"
9198,"In the second and third years credit against foodgrains was controIled with a view to deal with foodgrain shortage and so, borrowings by the private sector could not increase.
"
9199,"In the fourth year borrowings by the private sector increased by 18.00 percent in FY 1983/84 as the economy was set in motion with the increase in GDP restriction on credit against foodgrains was relaxed and special programms for export promotion were executed.
"
9200,"It is estimated that in FY 1984/85 credit to the private sector will  increase by 18.00 percent.
"
9201,"Out of the toal credit of Rs 6.97 billion from the banking sector, 67.00 percent (Rs 4.67 billion) was disbursed, to His Majesty's Government, 7.00 percent (Rs 0.46 billion) to public io corporations and 26.00 percent (Rs 1.84 billion) to the private sector.
"
9202,"Bemuse of substantial increase in credit to His Majesty's Government, there has been a remarkable change in pattern of internal loan within the five years. Internal borrowings by His Majesty's Government are expected to increase by 53.00 percent in 1985 compared with 29.00 percent in 1980.
"
9203,"If borrowings by public corporations are included in the government sector, the proportion would reach 67.00 percent by the middle of July 1985.  
"
9204,"During the p1an period, the actual increase was only Rs 0.0386 billion because the bala1ance of Rs 0.4599 billion was simply due to, profit accrued out of currency devaluation and changes in exchange rates.
"
9205,"In the first year it increased by 8.00 percent (Rs 0.1926 billion),
"
9206,"In the second year, it decreased by 21.00 percent (Rs 0.5015 billion).
"
9207,"But in the third year, there was a decline in net foreign assets by 22 percent (Rs 0.6750 billion) because of adverse balance of payment.
"
9208,"In the fourth year also, there was a decline by 5.00 percent (Rs 0.1264 billion).
"
9209,"In the fifth year it is estimated to increase by 6.00 percent (Rs 0.1559 billion).
"
9210,"In totality, net foreign assets had no substantial influence in the expansion of the money supply.
"
9211,"Increase in time deposit was 26.00 percent (Rs 0.6450 billion) in the first year, at 24.00 percent (Rs 0.7466 billion) in the second year, at 27.00 percent (Rs 1.0270 billion) in the third year, at 13.00 percent (Rs 0.6502 billion) in the fourth year and 18.00 percent (Rs 1.0000 billion) in the fifth year respective1y.
"
9212,"Thus, time deposit increased annually at the average rate of 21.60 percent during the five year period, and was instrumental in, the contraction by 58.0% of additional money supply, generated by expansion in internal credit.
"
9213,"Another factor with contractionary effect in money supply, capital and net unclassified liability is estimated to increase by, 3.30 percent per annum (Rs 0.2194 billion).
"
9214,"The main feature of the credit extension by commercial banks during the second and the third years of the Plan period is the diversion of credit from the private sector to the public sector.
"
9215,"Credit to the private sector was controlled in order to meet the growing deficit of government finance.
"
9216,"In FY 1980/81, banks expanded additional credit by Rs 9.7588 billion (23.90 percent), out of which 75.00 percent (Rs 0.5687) was made available to the private sector.
"
9217,"In FY 1981/82, additional credit was extended Rs 0.2953 billion (7.50 percent) out of which 47 percent (Rs 0.1400 billion) was available to the private sector.
"
9218,"In FY 1982/83, additional credit expanded by Rs 0.9291 billion (22.00 percent) out of which 6.30 percent (Rs 0.0585 billion) went to the private sector.
"
9219,"There was substantial contraction in credit to the private sector because of steps taken in credit control in order to meet increasing credit needs of the public sector and meet the adverse balance of payment in FY 1982/83.
"
9220,"But from FY 1983/84, because of relaxation in credit control, banks were active again in meeting credit requirement of the private sector.
"
9221,"In that year, there was additional credit expansion by Rs 0.7181 billion (12.00 percent). Of this, Rs  0.4444 billion (62.00 percent) was made available to the private sector.
"
9222,"In the final year of the Plan i. e. FY 1984/85, additional increase of Rs 0.9274 billion (16.00 percent) in credit by banks is estimated of which 70.00 percent (Rs0.6474 billion) is expected to flow to the private sector.
"
9223,"During this period, there has been a remarkable change in the pattern of credit by commercial banks.
"
9224,"The proportion of the private sector share in total loan and investment was 59.00 percent in July 1980. It went up to 62.00 percent in July 1981 and declined to 51.00 percent in July 1982.
"
9225,"Some improvement took place in this proportion since 1983/84, reaching 53.00 percent in July 1984 and is estimated to reach 56.00 percent by July 1985.
"
9226,"Deposits with the commercial banks increased substantially during the period under review.
"
9227,"The deposit increased by Rs 0.8135 billion (24.00 percent), Rs 0.7638 billion (18.00 percent), Rs 1.3795 billion (28.00 percent), and Rs 0.7805 (12.00 percent) in the first year, second year, third year and fourth year respectively.
"
9228,"In the fifth year it estimated to increase by Rs 1.3454 billion (19.00 percent).
"
9229,"Thus the deposits with the commercial banks are expected to reach Rs 8.4124 billion by mid-July 1985 at the growth rate of 20.40 percent per annum.
"
9230,"Of the total deposit of Rs 5.0827 billion with the commercial banks the proportion of the savings and fixed deposits comes to 73 percent or Rs 3.6963 billion.
"
9231,"Savings deposit has grown at the annual rate of 23.00 percent and fixed deposit at 20.00 percent during this period.
"
9232,"Attractive interest rate and extension of branches of the commercial banks have led to the fast growth of savings and fixed deposits.
"
9233,"The reforms of the interest rates in April 1976 brought about a remarkable change in the composition of deposits with the commercial banks.
"
9234,"In mid-July 1976, the share of saving and fixed deposits in the total deposit was 59 % only. This increased to 72 percent in mid-July 1980 in five years.
"
9235,"In mid-July 1985, saving and fixed deposits are expected to reach Rs 6.0824 billion, i.e. 72 percent of the total deposit.
"
9236,"Though saving deposit grew at a fast rate, the growth rate of fixed deposit declined suddenly since 1983/84.
"
9237,"The cause for this decline is that saving of non-financial corporations and personal saving were increasingly invested in development bonds bearing 13.00 percent interest and the shares floated by the private companies.
"
9238,"The dependence of commercial banks on the Nepal Rastra Bank decreased because of substantial increase in deposits with them during the Plan period.
"
9239,"An integrated banking programme was launched from mid-October 1980 with a view to financing projects under priority sector under regional basis.
"
9240,"Special attention is given to the feasibility and supervisory aspects of the projects financed under this programme and a policy of financing individuals without mortagable assets against collective security has been adopted.
"
9241,"Additionally, 60.00 percent of the total loan under this priority sector is provided to small families.
"
9242,"In the initial years of the Sixth Plan, it was made obligatory to the commercial banks to finance minimum of 7.00 percent of the total deposit liability the projects under the priority sector.
"
9243,"This proportion was raised to 10.00 percent in FY 1982/83 and the same was maintained in FY 1983/84.
"
9244,"But because the commercial banks could not attain this level, it was reduced to 8.00 percent in FY 1984/85.
"
9245,"In order to launch this credit programme under the priority sector in an integrate manner, a committee by the name of Priority sector Coordination Committee was established with representation from concerned institutions.
"
9246,"Presently, integrates banking programmes are implemented through 133 branches.
"
9247,"In the first four years of the Plan, commercial banks invested additional, Rs 0.1262 billion in priority sector projects.
"
9248,"Out of this, agriculture sector received Rs 0.0581 billion and cottage industry sector Rs 0.0830 billion.
"
9249,"In the service sector, investment went down by Rs 0.0149 billion. In FY 1984/85 it is aimed to invest additional Rs 0.2538 billion in priority sector projects.
"
9250,"A special programme was launched from FY 1982/83 in 9 districts three in Kathmandu Valley and six in Gandaki for making financial assistance available to the cottage and small scale industries through commercial banks.
"
9251,"The policy adopted under this programme is to give more importance to the feasibility of the project and seriousness of the industrialist than collateral for.
"
9252,"By the end of FY 1983/84, loans amounting to Rs 46.40 billion were disbursed under this programmes. This helped establish 1,413 small-scale industries creating employment opportunities for 13,678 persons.
"
9253,"It is estimated that the banks will disburse additional Rs 75.00 million for the development of small-scale industries in FY 1984/85.
"
9254,"By mid-July 1980, the commercial banks had 241 branches and one branch covered 60 thousand persons.
"
9255,"In the  first four years of the Sixth Plan, additional 115 new branches were opened.
"
9256,"Agricultural Development Bank was permitted to start banking transactions with a separate branch in Kathmandu. A new bank by the name of Nepal Arab Bank was established under joint collaboration by the Nepalese and foreigners.
"
9257,"Thus by the end of the fourth year of the Sixth Plan, there were 351 branches of commercial banks with banking transactions.
"
9258,"In FY 1984/85 Agricultural Development Bank has been permitted to conduct general, banking transactions through its 23 branches and it is estimated that the commercial banks will open additional 30 branches by mid-July 1985. This amounts to 411 branches, which will conduct banking transitions, one branch covering 41,000 persons.
"
9259,"Nepal Rastra Bank initiated various monetary policy measures in order to control the flow and composition of the loans made available by the commercial banks.
"
9260,"In FY 1981/82 with the new arrangement regarding the requirement of liquidity by the commercial banks should maintain liquidity to the extent of 25 % of total deposit of this liquidity of 4 % is to be in cash in hand, 5% deposit at Nepal Rastra Bank.
"
9261,"Interest rate for saving and fixed deposits was increased by 0.50 percent and that for the loans by 1.00 percent from mid-July 1982.
"
9262,"Loans against mortgage of foodgrains were not permitted because of foodgrain shortages due to unfavourable weather conditions in 1982/83.
"
9263,"In order to rectify the unfavourable balance of payment at the close of that year, 100.00 % margin was fixed for the import of luxurious and semi-luxurious goods from the countries other than , and from mid-July 1983 complete restriction was imposed on the latter of credit from import.
"
9264,"But in FY 1983/84 some steps were taken in relaxing the controls in the credit administration providing pre-export credit at the subsidized interest rates.
"
9265,"The target set for the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation was to finance Rs 502.70 million, including investment in equity, and for the Agricultural Development Bank to finance (gross) Rs 1744.10 million on industry and agriculture sectors during the Sixth Plan.
"
9266,"In the first year, i.e., 1980/81, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation increased the annual loan dis bursement by 77 percent (Rs 46.10 million).
"
9267,"In the second year it went down by 24.00 percent to Rs 35.10 million.
"
9268,"In the third year, it increased by 105.0 % percent to Rs 72.00 million, 
"
9269,"and in the fourth year it again went down by 29.00 percent to Rs 51.10 million.
"
9270,"Thus, the corporation will be investing Rs 284.30 million in loans, which will be 57.00 percent of the target in the Sixth Plan. 
"
9271,"In case of Agricultural Development Bank, annual disbursement went down by 9.00 percent in FY 1980/81 to Rs 134.10 million.
"
9272,"But in the second, third and fourth years its loan disbursement increased to Rs 256.50 million, Rs 345.80 million and Rs 453.20 million respectively 
"
9273,"It is expected to reach Rs 551.20 million in the fifth year of the plan
"
9274,"Thus, the Agricultural Development Bank fulfilled 100% of the target by disbursing a total of Rs 1740.80 million during the Plan period
"
9275,"The increase in the number of small farmer development projects operated by the Agricultural Development  Bank is encouraging.
"
9276,"In FY 1979/80, the number of small farmer development projects was 29 only.
"
9277,"In FY 1983/84 this number increased to 121.
"
9278,"In these projects 29,293 small farmer members and 3,013 groups were involved.
"
9279,"In FY 1984/85, it was estimated that additional 39 will start, thereby increasing the total number of projects to 160.
"
9280,"Agricultural Development Bank invested Rs 57.50 million in these projects in. The first four years of the Plan and with additional loan disbursement of Rs 50.70 million in the final year, the total loan disbursement will reach Rs 108.20 million in the Sixth Plan.
"
9281,"The cooperative organizations could not record any substantial progress during the Plan period.
"
9282,"Attention  was paid on the integration and consolidation of the established organizations rather than on establishment of new ones.
"
9283,"In FY 1979/80, there were 711 cooperative organizations.
"
9284,"In the first four years of the Plan period 56, cooperatives were established.
"
9285,"In FY 1983/84, there was no increase in number because of the reorganization of the existing ones.
"
9286,"In FY1979780, the strength of these organizations was 1.194 million member which reached 1.393 million with an increase by 17 percent.
"
9287,"The cooperative organizations made loans available amounting to Rs 121.50 million as of mid-July 1980 which reached Rs 201.20 million by mid-July 1984 at an annual growth rate of 13.40 percent.
"
9288,"In 1984/85 it is estimated that additional 13 cooperatives would be established.
"
9289,"In the first four years of the Plan period Employees Provident Fund increased its investment in equity and loan substantially, with diversification in the composition of investment.
"
9290,"The Fund had expanded its investment by Rs 925.30 million - Rs 639.90 million in equity and Rs 285.40 million in loan disbursement.
"
9291,"This investment has been possible because of the remarkable increase of the financial resources of the fund, which increased by Rs 942.40 million.
"
9292,"One reason for this increase is the beginning provident fund deduction by the educational institutions and some government agencies.
"
9293,"The composition of the investment and loan has changed since 1983/84.
"
9294,"The principal sector of the investment by the fund was in fixed deposit at the commercial banks in the first three years of the Plan from the fourth year, investment in development bonds increased substantial.
"
9295,"By mid-August 1985, the Fund is expected to increase investment by Rs 352.90 million.
"
9296,"The role of National Insurance Corporation had become wider in mobilizing insurance premium for use in development activities during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9297,"In the first four years of the Plan period the resource of the corporation increased by Rs 104.80 million.
"
9298,"During this period, the corporation increased investment and loan by Rs 86.00 million of which was invested development bonds.
"
9299,"In FY 1984/85, the corporation is expected to increase loans and investment by Rs 49.00 million.
"
9300,"In the Fifth Plan period, Postal saving bank services was initiated as a new institutional arrangement for collecting savings.
"
9301,"Under this service savings account can be opened with a minimum of Rs 5.00 and with a maximum deposit ceiling Rs 30,000.00.
"
9302,"Upto FY 1979/80, 25 district post offices provided this service.
"
9303,"By FY 1983/84, 75 post offices have provided this service. This corporation is authorized to guarantee credits upto Rs 0.20 million for agriculture and other service sector under the priority sector from the commercial banks and upto Rs 1.00 million for industry.
"
9304,"In FY 1979/80, the Corporation guaranteed credit worth Rs 79.70 million, and this guarantee is expected to go up to Rs 122.50 million by  FY 1984/85.
"
9305,"As the capital asset of this corporation has not been able to increase adequately, it has not been able to expand its activities according needs.
"
9306,"Price Situation
"
9307,"Excessive pressure was felt in the price situation in the country during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9308,"In the first three years, price rose at the rate of 12.70 percent per annum 
"
9309,"In the fourth year it slowed down and stayed at 6.2 percent.
"
9310,"In the final year (1984/85) it is estimated to go up by 7 percent.
"
9311,"Thus the annual average price rise is expected to be 10.20 percent during the Plan period.
"
9312,"According to the national urban consumer price index, the overall prices recorded an increase by 13.40  percent in FY 1980/81 with prices of food and beverages increasing by 13.40 percent and of other goods and services by 13.30 percent.
"
9313,"As production of foodgrains was good this year, with the fall in the growth of price rise in rice, its price index increased by only 6.40 percent.
"
9314,"But of sugar and sweets, restaurant meals, oil and ghee increased by 63.40 percent and 66.00 percent respectively.
"
9315,"The prices of pulses, meat, fish, and eggs increased by 18 percent and of milk and milk products and beverages by more than 10.00 percent.
"
9316,"The price of the food and beverage group increased by more than 13 percent because of high increase of the prices of the food items.
"
9317,"Among the non-food items and services, the price of cloth and tailoring, medicines and health care and cigarettes increased by 6-7 percent only but that of footwear, fuel lamps and water, transport and communication and education and recreation increased by 10.00 percent.
"
9318,"Second year (1981/82), There was some improvement in the price situation and the price increase stayed at  10.40 percent.
"
9319,"The price increase of food and beverages dropped to 11.00 percent and that other goods and services to 9.40 percent.
"
9320,"Rice, vegetables, spices and milk and milk products are the ones among all food and beverages group which have recorded a high price rise.
"
9321,"The prices of meat, fish and eggs and sugar and sweets went down.
"
9322,"Among other goods and services group, cloth, tailoring, fuel, lamp and water are the ones, which have recorded a 10-11 percent price rise.
"
9323,"Third year (1982/83): The price increased by 14.20 percent.
"
9324,"Because of reduction of the foodgrain production,  the prices of food and beverages went up by 16 percent and of other goods and services by 10.60 percent.
"
9325,"Among food and beverage, rice recorded a price rise of 35 percent, grain and grain products 33 percent, meat, fish and eggs 21 percent, spices 15 percent, milk and milk products 13 percent, and beverages 17 percent.
"
9326,"Among other goods and services, fuel, lamps and water recorded a price rise of 19 percent, cigarettes by 10 percent, education and recreation by 9 percent and footwear by 8 percent respectively.
"
9327,"Fourth year (1983/84): The overall price increase was 6 percent when food and beverages prices recorded an increase by 5.20 percent and other goods and services by 8.50 percent respectively.
"
9328,"This year witnessed a good crop resulting in an improved price situation, compared to the previous year.
"
9329,"The price of foodgrains and foodgrain products went down by 10.40 percent and of sugar & sweets by 2.50 percent
"
9330,"but vegetables recorded a 16 percent price rise and meat, fish and eggs 17 percent.
"
9331,"Among other goods and services cloth and tailoring increased by 8 percent, of footwear by 7 percent, housing by 11 percent and education and recreation by 3 percent respectively.
"
9332,"Final year (1984/85): The price is estimated to increase by 7 percent.
"
9333,"Thus the average annual price rise during the Plan period works out to be 10.00 percent.
"
9334,"Except for the fourth and the fifth years, there has been an immense pressure on the price situation during the Plan period.
"
9335,"In sum, the price situation in the Plan period has not remained favourable.
"
9336,"During the period under review, the internal factors affecting the price rise are, a) poor agriculture crop in the base year 1979/80 and the third year 1982/83, b) price increase in other goods and services provided by the government corporation, c) frequent increase in the rates of the import duty, sales tax and excise duty and d) increase in money supply for because of excessive dependence on deficit finance by the government.
"
9337,"The international monetary situation in general and fast price rise in  in particular are the external factors affecting the price situation.
"
9338,"Foreign Trade and Balance of Payment
"
9339,"In case of foreign trade, the tendency for imports to size at a faster rate as compared to export is still prevalent. During the Sixth Plan period, the growth in exports is expected to be 13.5 % and that of annual imports at 16.9 %, leading to the growth in trade imbalance by 17.97 %.
"
9340,"Because of import restrictions, overseas trade imbalance has decreased. Yet the ever-widening unfavourable balance of payment with  has become a subject for serious concern.
"
9341,"During the first three years of the Sixth Plan period, trade imbalance deteriorated further.
"
9342,"During these years, exports went down and the economy had to face a huge trade deficit because of increasing imports and decreasing exports.
"
9343,"In the first year (FY 1980/81), because of favourable weather conditions, agricultural production increased extraordinarily compared to the minimal level attained in the previous year, FY 1980/81. Export shot up by 39.80 percent reaching the level of Rs 1608.70 million.
"
9344,"But, in the second year (FY 1981/82), the exports decreased by 7.30  percent to the level of Rs 1491.50 million.
"
9345,"In the following year (FY 1982/83), there was still further fall in exports by 24.10 percent, decreasing to the level of Rs 1132.00 million.
"
9346,"Exports dropped extraordinarily because of fall in agricultural production, due mainly to drought that year and also the prohibition of export of foodgrains and timber.
"
9347,"Overseas export of Rs 609.60 million in FY 1979/80 dropped by 2.1 percent to Rs 616.30 million in FY 1980/81. It dropped by 19.39 percent again to Rs 497.20 million in, 1981/82 and again at 41.90 percent to Rs 288.80 million in 1982/83.
"
9348,"In 1892/83, because of various measures taken by His Majesty's Government under a 9-point programme, there was remarkable boost in exports by 50.50 percent and hit an all-time high record of Rs 1703.90 million 
"
9349,"Export to India reached Rs 1160.70 million with an increase by 37.70 percent and to overseas countries Rs 543.20 million with an increase by 88.10 percent.
"
9350,"In the FY 1984/85, exports is estimated to reach Rs 2160.00 million with a 26.80 percent increase (Table 1.26).
"
9351,"Import has been increasing at an accelerated rate.
"
9352,"It increased by 27.30 percent in 1980/81, by 11.30 percent in 1981/82 and by 28.10 reaching Rs 6314.00 million in 1982/83.
"
9353,"In all these years, imports from overseas countries increased more than from India.
"
9354,"Because of deterioration balance of payment situation with overseas countries. Imports were restricted from other countries. So overall imports increased only by 3.2 percent reaching Rs 6510.00 million in 1983/84.
"
9355,"Imports from the overseas countries dropped to Rs 3456.30 million by 9.40 percent that year.
"
9356,"But from imports increased to Rs 3058.00 million with a growth of 22.30 percent.
"
9357,"In 1984/85, imports are expected to increase by 14.70% reaching Rs 7470.00 million.
"
9358,"As the restriction or imports from overseas are still in force, no substantial increase in imports is anticipated from overseas countries.
"
9359,"However, substantial increase in imports from India is anticipated.
"
9360,"Because of the falling exports and rising imports the overall trade deficit of Rs 2329.60 million in 1979/80  doubled to Rs 5182.00 in 1982/83.
"
9361,"During this period, trade deficit with overseas countries shot up to Rs 3525.60  million from Rs 1064.10 million.
"
9362,"However with India, the increase was from Rs 1265.50 to Rs 1656.40 million.
"
9363,"In 1983/84, exports increased substantially and increase in imports was marginal. So, trade deficit could be contained at Rs 4810.40 million in that year.
"
9364,"In FY 1984/85, it is estimated that the trade deficit will reach Rs 5310.00 million with an annual increase by 10.00 percent.
"
9365,"Analysis of the structure of trade during these years reveals that there has not been notable change in the  composition of export and imports.
"
9366,"If food and raw material showed prominence in exports, industrial goods was prominent in imports.
"
9367,"The volume export is observed to fluctuate along the changes in weather conditions and foodgrain export policy and its share was 61.00 percent in 1983/84.
"
9368,"Although there is some increase in the export of industrial goods, new exportable product has not emerged.
"
9369,"As jute and Jute goods could not fetch attractive prices in the overseas market, their export has been directed to India.
"
9370,"Woolen carpet alone has appeared as the main exportable commodity that could survive overseas market without any financial or foreign exchange subsidy.
"
9371,"In the case of imports the proportion of industrial goods was 72.0% in 1979/80 and has remained so in 1983/84 also.
"
9372,"During this period, as the proportion of food and raw materials has remained at 28.0 percent of the total imports, there seems to be ample possibility of import substitution in the agricultural sector too.
"
9373,"Analysis of the statistics of balance of payment reveals that, though current account losses increased with the trade losses in the first two years, balance of payment situation remained favourable because of increasing foreign aid.
"
9374,"But in the third year, i.e. 1982/83, foreign aid could not compensate for the big trade deficit. So, foreign reserve had to be used to meet its deficit.
"
9375,"In 1983/84, because of the improvement of the current account balance, balance of payment deficit decreased.
"
9376,"First year (1980/81): Though the trade deficit increased by 18 percent to Rs 2.83 billion yet because of increase in net services income by 28.00 percent and net transfer income by 30.00 percent, current account loss increased by only 5.00 percentage to Rs 1.16 billion.
"
9377,"That year though capital outflow stood at Rs 140.00 million, there was favourable overall balance of payment situation with a positive balance of Rs 190.00 million because of an inflow of Rs 149 billion in foreign aid.
"
9378,"Second year (FY 1981/82): Trade deficit increased by 22 percent and reached Rs 3.45 billion.
"
9379,"Net transfer income dropped by 6 percent this year.
"
9380,"But income from services increased by 23.00 percent.
"
9381,"Current account deficit went up to Rs 1.55 billion at the rate of 34.00 percent because income from services and net transfer incomes could not offset the trade deficit.
"
9382,"Because of the inflow of Rs 1.93 billion in foreign aid and capital inflow by Rs 120.00 million, there was an overall surplus of Rs 500.00 million in balance of payment.
"
9383,"Third year (FY 1982/83): On the one hand, export sharply dropped. On the other, import increased excessively leading to the increase in trade deficit by 5.10 percent.
"
9384,"Though income from services and net transfer increased by 19 percent and l0 percent respectively, current account loss doubled to reach Rs 2.99 billion because trade deficit shot up.
"
9385,"Inflow of foreign aid of Rs 2.24 billion and capital by Rs 70.00 million were inadequate to compensate this deficit. So the overall balance of payment deficit stood at Rs 680.00 million.
"
9386,"After many years, the country had to experience this kind of difficult situation again.
"
9387,"Fourth year (FYI983/84): Improvement in the exp ort front and minimal increase in imports led to a decrease in trade deficit by 7.00 percent to the level of Rs 4.80 billion.
"
9388,"Though income from services dropped by 12.00 percent because of the drop in income from tourism, net transfer income increased by 20.00 percent, leading to a decrease by l0 percent in current account deficit to the level of Rs 2.70 billlion.
"
9389,"Even though the inflow of foreign aid was Rs 2.79 billion, the overall balance of payment deficit stood at Rs 130.00 million because of the outflow of capital by an extent of Rs 220.00 million.
"
9390,"Fifth year (FY 1984/85): The trade deficit is expected to reach Rs 5.31 billion this year with total export of Rs  2.16 billion and total import of Rs 7.47 billion.
"
9391,"Net income from services is estimated to increase by 20.00 percent and transfer income by 8.00 percent to reach the level of Rs 740.00 million.
"
9392,"Though current account deficit is expected to increase by 5% to the level of Rs 2.84 billion, an estimated inflow of foreign aid to the extent of Rs 3.25 billion is expected to lead to a balance of payment surplus of Rs 160.00 million, in spite of the estimated capital outflow of Rs 260.00 million.
"
9393,"During the period under review, different patterns in the balance of payment situation vis-a-vis  and overseas are noted.
"
9394,"During the Fifth Plan period (1975-80), balance of payment with  deteriorated significantly.
"
9395,"A total of Rs 2.32 billion worth of foreign exchange had to be sold to purchase Indian currency in order to meet the trade deficit.
"
9396,"In the first year of the Sixth Plan too, there was a balance-of payment deficit of Rs 70.00 million.
"
9397,"That year too, some Rs 615.00 million worth of foreign exchange had to be sold in order to purchase Indian currency.
"
9398,"But in the second and the third years, there was a balance-of-payment surplus of Rs 340.00 million and Rs 210.00 million respectively with India.
"
9399,"There was balance-of payment surplus of Rs 260.00 million and Rs 160.00 million in the first and the second years respectively with overseas countries.
"
9400,"But in the third year, a balance-of-payment deficit of Rs 880.00 million was recorded.
"
9401,"In the fourth year, the balance of payment with these countries improved and there was a surplus of Rs 230.00 million

"
9487,"3. Drinking Water
"
9488,"a. Easy availability of pure drinking water is the basic necessity for the good health of the people.
"
9489,"Nepal has been designing and implementing health programmes in line with the United Nations programme of providing good health to all the people of the world by 2000.
"
9490,"b. Table 7 presents the situation of drinking water facilities on the basis of population at the end of the Sixth Plan.
"
9491,"c. Efforts are in full swing to supply drinking water through pipes.
"
9492,"Still lack of studies, lack of commodities, transport problems, lack of technical manpower, inexperienced contractors, etc. are some of the major obstacle to successful implementation.
"
9493,"Hence, it is necessary to consider supply of water by wells, stone taps, etc. with the participation of people as an additional alternative in addition to the supply of water through pipes.
"
9494,"Drinking water projects have to be made more economical in order to supply drinking water to a larger segment of the population as it is a basic necessity.
"
9495,"d. Drinking water is not accessible to all the population in the urban areas. The purity of water supplied to these areas is also not property maintained.
"
9496,"It is highly desirable that distribution system should be improved in order to supply pure drinking water and in plenty too.
"
9497,"e. So far, attention has centered around supply of drinking water through pipe only while the purity aspects have not received due consideration.
"
9498,"To keep the people healthy and free from diseases, pure drinking water is very essential. Necessary steps, therefore, have to be taken to supply pure water.
"
9499,"f. Leakage of water supply made available at a big investment is becoming a major problem.
"
9500,"No study has been undertaken to make a correct assessment of the situation. So necessary studies have to be conducted to assess the quantity of this leakage and revise ways and means to stop it.
"
9501,"g. To hand over the drinking water project to the local institutions such as Panchayat for the supply of water and maintain the water projects in proper order in the rural and urban area.
"
9502,"If local Panchayats can be associated during the construction stages its effectiveness will also increase and this also needs serious consideration.
"
9503,"Objective
"
9504,"Once the ecology is badly effected it is extremely difficult to bring it back to its original state even if huge amounts are invested.
"
9505,"Although this problem cannot be tackled in full, however, plans for curtailing it can be considered from an 'early stage.
"
9506,"The objective, therefore, is to maintain good health, security and well being of the people by protection, preservation, consolidation and total management of the ecology.
"
9507,"Policy
"
9508,"The following policy will be adopted in the Seventh Plan to fulfill the aforesaid objective:
"
9509,"1. In implementing physical development activities construction industrial projects, consideration will be given to execute such projects after proper studies and evaluations especially against the background of ecological problems. Attention will also be given to maintain quality of natural resources with least damage to the ecology and with consideration to appropriate alternatives.
"
9510,"Effluents from industries will have to be treated before they can spoil the air and water.
"
9511,"2. In order to improve the imbalance between ecology and land use and to minimise the deterioration of ecology from the implementation of development projects, national ecology protection policy and acts and regulation (thereby related) will be formulated.
"
9512,"Encouragement will be given to convert the marginal land to forest and grazing fields for the best use of the land.
"
9513,"4. To collect statistics, conduct studies and research related to ecology in fixing the national minimum level of pollution.
"
9514,"5. Courses on ecology will be included in the formal and informal courses and by giving due importance to ecology education through exhibitions and publicity and promotions.
"
9515,"6. Special attention will be given to encourage the non-government organisations to participate in the ecology oriented protection and propagation activities. Accordingly Panchayats, class organisations and social organisation will be encouraged to be more active.
"
9516,"7. Taming of rivers with the participation of the people to control and erosion and to encourage afforestation and forestry programs will be given special attention.
"
9517,"In addition efforts will be made to consolidate the process of balancing weather and water resources by controlling the land erosion in the watershed area.
"
9518,"8. To develop tourism without any harm to the natural resources and the cultural heritage.
"
9519,"9. Rehabilitation, urbanisation and development programmes will be implemented by scientifically classifying the land composition and land use.
"
9520,"10. Activities related to ecology involve forest, agriculture, electricity, irrigation, industry, commerce, road construction, population and public health.
"
9521,"Necessary steps will be taken to coordinate the activities of different organisations in order to make them effective, keeping in view the fact that solution of ecological problems demand multifaceted and multi-organisation approaches.
"
9522,"Land-use policy
"
9523,"1. To stop the cultivation of non-productive and marginal land.
"
9524,"2. Suitable land for cultivation will be identified and afforestation in the marginal land will be implemented.
"
9525,"3. Policy will be adopted to develop suburban areas by providing necessary amenities in lands except productive lands which will be utilised for agriculture.
"
9526,"4. To execute programmes which will increase agricultural production from the cultivable land around the densely populated urban areas and firewood and grass production from the forest areas in order to meet the requirement of the population.
"
9527,"5. For increasing green vegetation in the naked hills, afforestation will be carried out or encourage commercial crops wh ich do not disturb the soil condition.
"
9528,"6. To adopt scientific techniques to protect soil for cultivation on the slopes with more than 30 percent gradient.
"
9529,"7. In steep slopy land, interior terai and base of the hills of the interiorterai, afforestation will be effected, which will preserve underground water.
"
9530,"8. Programmes related to taming of rivers will be launched with the participation of people for protecting the cultivable land and villages.
"
9531,"1. To improve balance of payments by increasing exports,
"
9532,"2. To expand and diversify the export market by enhancing the competitiveness of the exportable goods with adoption of high technology and skill development.
"
9533,"3. To increase national production and employment opportunities by developing export trade.
"
9534,"Supply Situation of Construction Materials
"
9535,"The total consumption of cement is estimated to be 1,515,200 metric tons with 1,090,000 metric tons of actual consumption in the first four years and an estimated consumption of 425,200 metric tons in 1984/85 at the end of the Plan period, which is 89.90 percent of the estimated total plan requirements of 1,742,600 metric tons.
"
9536,"Himal Cement at Chovar could supply only 142,439 metric tons which is 9.40 percent of the estimated plan requirements.
"
9537,"National Trading Ltd. is expected to import 170,450 metric tons during this period.
"
9538,"From the import licenses issued in 1984/85 it is revealed that of the total imports 48.60 percent was by traders, 36.50 percent by different organisations and 14.90 percent by public sector organisations respectively.
"
9539,"The total demand of iron and steel products was estimated to be 288,649 metric tons.
"
9540,"To meet this, it was aimed to have Nepalese re-rolling mills would produce 140,00 metric tons of iron rods and to establish an electric are furnace with capacity of 20-22 thousand tons in the third year of the Plan period for producing 60,000 metric tons of billets. 
"
9541,"But the re-rolling mill produced 46,980 metric tons of iron rods only and the proposed arc furnace was not established.
"
9542,"From 1983/84, 5000 tons of galvanised sheets was met by domestic source annually. National Trading Ltd. would import 27,003 metric tons of iron rods and 2,258 metric tons of galvanised sheets.
"
9543,"Imports of iron and steel goods through some private sector and foreign commodity aid have been consumed by several construction projects.
"
9544,"The estimate of these imports of iron and steel products is 250,614 metric tons or 86.80 percent of the estimated total demand.
"
9545,"The requirement of bricks for the Sixth Plan period was estimated at 1,593,290 thousand pieces in the public and private sectors.
"
9546,"Public sector brick and tiles factories produced 120,005 thousand bricks and 2,548 thousand tiles which partially met the requirement of the  and the balance by the private sector brick factories.
"
9547,"During the Plan period there was a decline in brick production at 1,385,675 thousand pieces only (or 87.00 percent) because of the non-availability of adequate firewood from the fuel corporation in the later years of the Plan, difficulties in the supply of coal and of the increasing prices of firewood and coal.
"
9548,"During the Sixth Plan period, the requirement of timber was estimated at 819,418 cubic meter, and only 433,579 cubic meter in supply was estimated in all, 18.70 percent of this supply was distributed to the public sector activities and 81.30 percent to the private sector.
"
9549,"In the Sixth Plan period, as a large proportion of the estimated requirement of the polythene pipes of 5,566 metric tons was met by the supply from the industries established at Balaju, Kalaiya and Dharan, there was less dependence on imports for supply.
"
9550,"These industries are estimated to have produced 4,447 metric tons in the Plan period.
"
9551,"During the Sixth Plan period, 187,099 metric tons of chemical fertilizers (89.90 percent of the estimated demand), consisting of 141,452 metric tons (109.00 percent) of nitrogenous fertilizers, 41,092 metric tons (85.00 percent) of phosphate and 4,555 metric tons (12.00 percent) of potash was imported during the Plan period against an estimated total requirement of 215,402 metric tons consisting of 129,292 metric tons of nitrogenous fertilizer, 41,802 metric tons of phosphate and 38,008 metric tons of potash.
"
9552,"A total consumption of 630,000 metric tons of petroleum goods (63.40 percent of the estimated damned), which includes actual consumption of 477,864 metric tons during the first four years and estimated consumption of 152,000 metric tons in 1984/85, has been estimated for the Sixth Plan period against an estimated demand of 994,079 metric tons.
"
9553,"During the plan period, petrol consumption increased by 1.90 percent, high speed diesel by 4.50 percent, L. P. gas by 4.30 percent and furnace oil by 7.40 percent.
"
9554,"But the demand for kerosene oil and light diesel dropped by 0.10 percent and 2.10 percent respectively in the same period.
"
9555,"About 516,300 metric tons of coke and coal in total requirement was estimated for the Sixth Plan period and it was aimed that the Fuel Corporation would import them on the basis of a long term contract agreement for their assured supply. Because the Fuel Corporation did fulfill this arrangement, concerned industries and private sector traders started importing coke and coal on their own.
"
9556,"It is estimated that 142,532 metric tons of coke and coal was imported during the Plan period.
"
9557,"In the Sixth Plan period, the projected demand of writing and printing paper is 59,525.00 metric tons.
"
9558,"In the period only 16,400 metric tons or 27.50 percent of the projected demand was estimated to have been imported.
"
9559,"During the Sixth Plan period, the demand for newsprint was estimated at 7,143.00 metric tons of which 6,000 metric tons was required for Gorkhapatra Corporation alone.
"
9560,"The Corporation imported 1,800 metric tons of newsprint during the period.
"
9561,"A total of 3,000 metric tons of newsprint, including imports by the private sector is estimated to have been imported during the Plan period, which is 42.00 percent of the projected demand.
"
9562,"Projected demand and actual supply of the construction and development goods during the Sixth Plan period are given in Table 1.31.
"
9563,"Supply of Technical Manpower
"
9564,"There was a total supply of 19,975 technical manpower as of 1979/80, the final year of the Fifth Plan.
"
9565,"The total requirement of technical manpower at the end of 1984/85 was projected at 39,472, including additional requirement of 19,487 during the Sixth Plan.
"
9566,"Additional supply of technical manpower is estimated at 10,699 in the Sixth Plan period and total supply is estimated at 30,674 by mid-July 1985.
"
9567,"At the end of the Sixth Plan, it is expected that there would be a shortfall of 8,788 in the supply of technical manpower.
"
9568,"The severe scarcity is felt among basic level technicians.
"
9569,"In this level alone, there is a shortfall of 4,204 persons which is 47.80 percent of total deficit in supply.
"
9570,"In the middle level, the shortfall is estimated at 3,312 persons (or 37.70 percent) and in the higher level 1,272 (or 14.50 percent).
"
9571,"In totality, even though there appears to have shortages in all the three levels higher, middle and basic levels -there appears to have surplus of 2 and 180 in scientific and technical group (higher level) and forest sector forester group (basic level) respectively.
"
9572,"Normally supply of higher level technical manpower is fulfilled by those, returning from studies in the foreign countries.
"
9573,"And during the Sixth Plan period, a total of 1,250 scholarships was utilised.
"
9574,"Thus, the shortage of technical manpower was to an extent obstacle in the effective implementation of development projects.
"
9575,"Project demand and actual supply of technical manpower are presented in the Table 1.32.
"
9576,"Physical Achievement
"
9577,"It was envisaged that the principal foodgrain crops and cash crops would increase annually by 2.80 percent and 3.90 percent respectively in the Sixth Plan period.
"
9578,"And the target for their combined growth rate was set at 3.00 percent. During the first four years of the plan period, foodgrain crops increased by 7.40 percent and cash crops by 2.20 percent. Consequently as their combined growth the principal agricultural crops increased by 6.40 percent. 
"
9579,"Against the potential production situation of the fifth year of the plan period, foodgrain production is expected to grow by 6.20 percent and cash crops by 4.20 percent on annual basic with the consequent average annual growth in agricultural production by 5.90 percent during the entire Sixth Plan period.
"
9580,"The target for foodgrain production by the final year of the Sixth Plan i.e. 1984/85, was set at 4.346 million metric tons. The actual production by the fourth year was 4.246 million metric tons.
"
9581,"The production of paddy and wheat surpassed the targets.
"
9582,"The target set for the production of pulses was 95 thousand metric tons per year. However, the production attained was only 84 thousand metric tons with increase in production in the first two years. 
"
9583,"Among cash crop, the production of potatoes exceeded the target.
"
9584,"But the production of sugarcane, oil, tobacco and jute is expected to fall short of the targets.
"
9585,"In particular, the production of oil and jute fell sharply below targets.
"
9586,"According to available statistics, the production of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish and milk products marked a favourable situation.
"
9587,"The distribution of agricultural inputs implements fell short of target of the Sixth Plan except for agricultural credit.
"
9588,"In the first four years of the plan period, improved seed distribution attained 51 percent and chemical fertilizer 53 percent respectively of the targets of the Sixth Plan.
"
9589,"Agricultural credit attained 68.00 percent of the target in the four years and it is expected the plan target will be met.
"
9590,"Total acreage with irrigation facilities in public sector was 1,98,481 hectares by the end of the Fifth Plan, i.e. 1979/80.
"
9591,"The Sixth Plan had the target of more than doubling acreage under irrigation bringing total acreage to 4,31,963 hectares by extending additional irrigation facility to 2,33,482 hectares by the end of the Sixth Plan in 1984/85.
"
9592,"In the first four years of the Sixth Plan, irrigation facilities were made available to 73,212 hectares.
"
9593,"It is expected that 66,979 hectares thus additional 140,191 hectares (60 percent of the target) will receive irrigation facilities at the complete of Sixth Plan.
"
9594,"This achievement has brought 338,672 hectares of land under irrigation and 13 percent of the cultivable land is expected to receive government irrigation facilities.
"
9595,"The target was set to have 42,872 hectares under afforestation programme in the Sixth Plan.
"
9596,"In the first four years additional 25,284 hectares of land had come under afforestation.
"
9597,"In the final year of the plan 12,162 hectares of land are expected to have afforestation. Thus the total area under afforestation is 37,446 hectares i.e. 87.30 percent of the Sixth Plan target.
"
9598,"There was an appreciable progress of achieving 87 percent of the target in afforestation. However, only 23 percent of the target could be fulfilled in the case of panchayat protected afforestation programme.
"
9599,"With respect to soil and watershed conservation, control of 167 gorge (l08 percent of the target) and terrace improvement in 280 hectare (125 percent of the target) are estimated to be completed during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9600,"Though it appears that achievement to satisfactory compared to the target of the Plan, yet it hardly leaves any room for satisfaction because the set programme themselves are for limited vis -a-vis the magnitude of the problems prevalent in the country.
"
9601,"On the other hand, the soil erosion problem continues to be worsening.
"
9602,"Industry
"
9603,"There was an appreciable increase in industrial production since the second year as a result of improvement  in the power supply with the completion of the Kulekhani Hydel Project (capacity 60.00 Megawatts) and Devighat Hydel Project (capacity 14.10 Megawatts).
"
9604,"The Sixth Plan had the target of increasing industrial production by 10 percent per annum.
"
9605,"From the available statistics of the first four years, it is revealed that average annual rate of 10.40 percent was recorded, much in line with the Plan target.
"
9606,"Industrial production could increase only at 0.40 percent in the first year of the Plan.
"
9607,"But in the second, third and fourth years, industrial production increased at 10.50, 18.40 and 13.20 percent respectively.
"
9608,"Keeping in view of the expected achievement in the final year, the average annual rate of increase of industrial production is estimated to be 10.30 percent with the Plan period.
"
9609,"Among the new industries in the public sector, Hetauda Cement Factory is likely to go into trial production within the Plan period.
"
9610,"The expansion of Himal Cement has lagged behind the schedule.
"
9611,"Only preliminary works could be undertaken towards the establishment of the proposed textile plant at Butwal.
"
9612,"Construction works of the Vrikuti Paper Factory at Nawalparasi is not expected to be completed during the Plan period.
"
9613,"Construction works of the proposed paper factory at Nepalgunj could not be started.
"
9614,"The establishment of Lumbini Sugar Mill is still at a preliminary stage.
"
9615,"The progress of construction of Ganesh Himal Lead Zinc Industry and Kharidhunga Magnesite Plants have remained slow and the construction of Rosin Turpentine industry at Kailali has not progressed satisfactorily.
"
9616,"A target of disbursing Rs 502.70 million in industrial finance through Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) to private entrepreneurs was set in the Sixth Plan.
"
9617,"NIDC has been able to disburse only Rs 204.30 million in industrial loans in the first four years of the Plan.
"
9618,"It is expected that Rs 80.00 million in industrial credit would be extended in the final year. Thus, the total industrial credit made available within the Plan period is expected to be Rs 284.30 million. This makes only 56.60 percent of the Plan target.
"
9619,"Industrial Enterprises Act 1981, Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act, 1982 and Ordinance 1984 related to industrial taxes are among the important measures introduced for encouraging the private entrepreneurs.
"
9620,"However, necessary by-laws and other regulations have not been implemented during the Plan period in order to make the acts operative. Nor institutional arrangements have been made as yet to make these facilities speedily available to the industries.
"
9621,"Though the execution of the programmes for the promotion of cottage and small industries with World Bank assistance in the nine districts in Gandaki and Bagmati Zones was belatedly carried out from 1982/83, it seems to have picked up momentum appreciably of late.
"
9622,"Under this programmes the credit of Rs 46.40 million, through banks has been disbursed by FY 1983/84. This has helped establish 1,413 small industries and create 13,678 job opportunities.
"
9623,"Different kinds of vocational and technical training were imparted to 27,140 persons against a target of 28,950 persons in the Plan period under cottage industries development programme.
"
9624,"The growth of tourist arrivals in 1980 and 1981 remained slow and picked up only in 1982.
"
9625,"The number of tourist arrivals in that year increased by 8.50 percent and reached 175,000 persons.
"
9626,"Tourist arrivals increased by 2.30 percent in 1983 and reached the level of 179,000 persons.
"
9627,"A study has been completed with the assistance of  to prepare a well- coordinated tourism development plan with proper analysis of problems and prospects of the promotion of tourism.
"
9628,"Publicity and information promotion of tourism remained the principal programmes under public sector for the tourists.
"
9629,"Hotel Management and Tourism Training Centre provided training to 603 persons against the Plan target of 625 persons.
"
9630,"Permission was granted for international charter flights under private sector with a view to promote tourist arrivals.
"
9631,"Transport and Communication
"
9632,"The Sixth Plan had set the target of constructing 1,950 km of roads within the Plan period.
"
9633,"By the end of the fourth year (1983/84), 1,516 Km of roads was constructed.
"
9634,"Keeping in view of the attainable progress in the last year 1984/85, it is expected that construction of 1,742 Km will be completed by the Plan period. This makes 89.30 percent of the target.
"
9635,"In view of the upgrading works of existing roads, the net increases in the length of roads appears to be 777 Km only in the first four years and 233 km in the fifth year of the Plan period. This makes a net additional length of 1,010 Km during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9636,"By the end of the Fifth Plan, there was a total length of 4,940 Km. with additional 1,010 Km, it is estimated that there is 5,950 Km of road in the country by the end of the Sixth Plan period.
"
9637,"The progress of the construction of black topped road and fair weather roads appears satisfactory.
"
9638,"In the first four years of the Plan period, 89.40 percent of the target of the construction of black topped roads and 93.60 percent in the case of fair weather roads were achieved respectively. But only 57.30 percent of the target in case of gravelled roads was achieved.
"
9639,"The total achievement including that of the final year is expected to be 97.80 percent for the black topped roads, 111.50 percent for the fair weather roads and 67.80 percent for the gravelled roads respectively during the Sixth Plan.
"
9640,"Clearly the construction of gravelled road has lagged far behind target.
"
9641,"The construction target of suspension bridges by the Suspension Bridge Division is set at 300 with the Sixth Plan period. In the first four years 73 suspension bridges were completed and 56 suspension bridges are expected be completed in the final year, thus totalling 129 suspension bridges, this clearly makes only 43.00 percent for the target.
"
9642,"A target of constructing fifteen bridges for vehicular traffic was set in the Plan. Of this only 6 were constructed in the first four years.
"
9643,"In the final year, only three more bridges are expected to be completed. This makes a total of 9 bridges which again makes only 60.00 percent of the target of the Sixth Plan.
"
9644,"In the field of communications, the Plan had fixed the target of establishing additional 480 post offices. At the end of the fourth year 401 additional post offices were established.
"
9645,"In the final year 70 more post offices are expected to be added. Thus, a total of 471 post offices are expected to be established during the Plan period. This makes 98.10 percent of the target.
"
9646,"The target for the installation of 23,450 telephone lines was set in the Sixth Plan. In the first four years 6,700 telephone lines were installed, making 28.60 percent of the target.
"
9647,"The very slow progress in the installation of the telephone lines in  was the main reason for this poor progress.
"
9648,"In the final year, an addition of 7,200 lines is estimated to be installed The total number of telephone lines at the end of the Sixth Plan period is thus expected to be 13,900. This makes 59.30 percent of the Plan target.
"
9649,"Electricity
"
9650,"By 1979/80, the total installed capacity of power was 68,346 Kilowatts 52,588 Kilowatts in hydro electricity and 15,758 Kilowatts in diesel plants.
"
9651,"The Sixth Plan envisaged the target of the generation of a total power of 144,923 Kilowatts of which 124,000 Kilowatts would be from major hydro power projects, 5,833 Kilowatts from micro hydro power projects and 15,000 Kilowatts from diesel plants.
"
9652,"There was power crisis in the first two years of the Plan.
"
9653,"In the third year the addition of Kulekhani power project (capacity 60,000 Kilowatts) and the addition of Devighat project (capacity 14,100 Kw.) eased the power crisis to a large extent.
"
9654,"In the first four years of Plan, 86,045 Kilowatts were added.
"
9655,"In the final year, 1,600 Kilowatts are expected to be added. Thus, in the Plan period, 87,645 Kilowatts is expected to be added, thus fulfilling 60.50 percent of the target.
"
9656,"Transmission lines installed by the end of the fourth year is 90 Km. of 132 KV and 38 km of 66 KV. And with the expected completion of 110 km of 33KV in the fifth year, a total 238 km of transmission lines is expected to be completed during the Sixth Plan, 18.10 percent of the target.
"
9657,"The transmission lines under installation: a)542 km of 132 KV Hetauda-Biratnagar, Butwal-Nepalgunj and Dumkibas-Butwal, and b) 135 km. of 33 KV Dharan-Dhankuta, Trisuli-Dhunche-Shomdang, Kharidhunga-Charikot, Ghorahi- Tulsipur, covering a total length of 677 km. are expected to remain so under construction.
"
9658,"Education
"
9659,"There was an appreciable progress in education in the first four years of the Plan period.
"
9660,"Target of the literacy rate at 32.40 percent was set in the Plan. By the end of the fourth year, the literacy rate attained was 27.80 percent and is expected to reach 28.90 percent by the end of the fifth year.
"
9661,"The Sixth Plan envisaged the target of imparting access to primary education (class I-V) to 75 percent of the children of 6-10 years age.
"
9662,"In the fourth year itself the target was exceeded and reached 76.10 percent and it is expected to reach 78 percent by the end of the fifth year.
"
9663,"Though progress in the lower middle level and middle level is expected to be low against the target, the progress nonetheless, is encouraging.
"
9664,"In the lower middle level (Class VI-VII) the target was set at reaching 40 percent of the children (11-12 years age) and in the middle level (Class VIII-X) reaching 30 percent of the children (13-15 years age) in terms of access of education. The progress attained is 34 percent and 23 percent respectively.
"
9665,"By the end of the Plan period, it is expected that 35 percent of the children will have been receiving lower middle level education and 24 percent of children middle level education.
"
9666,"The target was fixed in the Plan to provide adult education to 900,000 persons. In the first four years, 254,000 persons were provided with adult education and by the end of the Plan 277,000 additional persons are expected to be receiving it.
"
9667,"Thus, in the field of adult education, 28.20 percent of the target was met in the first four years and by the end of the Plan period, 30.70 percent of the target is expected to be achieved.
"
9668,"In the field of higher education, the target was envisaged to admit 21,244 students in different fields - 5,892 students in technical, 9,347 students in vocational, 6,005 students in general education.
"
9669,"The progress of the first four years and that expected in the fifth year together shows that 108.40 percent of the target in technical, 43.30 percent in vocational and 69.40 percent in general would be achieved.
"
9670,"Health and Drinking Water
"
9671,"Special attention has been given to the extension of basic health services and medical care in providing minimum health services to the people in the Sixth Plan.
"
9672,"The target was set in the Plan to open 467 health posts. In the first four years 161 health posts were opened.
"
9673,"In the final year of the Plan 50 health posts are expected to be opened. So by the end of the Plan 211 additional health posts would be opened thus fulfilling 45.20 percent of the target (467 additional health posts).
"
9674,"Also, the target was set to employ 1250 rural health workers but only 511 health workers could be employed by the Plan period.
"
9675,"According to the aim of converting gradually the health post into integrated health posts, 450 health posts in 23 districts have been converted into integrated health post partially or in full.
"
9676,"In the case of medical care; the number of hospitals and beds could not be increased as per the Plan target because of the delay in construction of hospitals and quarters. It is envisaged that 9 hospitals (capacity l5 beds) will be constructed against the Plan target of twenty five (one each in 25 districts) and 1,126 beds would be added against the target of 1,434 beds in the hospitals in operation.
"
9677,"Regarding construction of 15 bed hospitals, hospital buildings are under construction in 20 districts.
"
9678,"Programmes launched under preventive health services have contributed remarkably in the control of malaria, leprosy and other epidemic diseases.
"
9679,"In order to bring the birth rate to 40 from 42 and the child birth from 6.3 to 5.8, the target was set to provide 900,000 couples with family planning services. It is expected that 1.524 million couples would be provided with these facilities.
"
9680,"This achievement has been possible because from the third year of the Plan period, family planning programmes were extended more effectively.
"
9681,"The target was to supply 317.40 million litres of water per day 177.80 million per day in the rural areas and 139.60 million litres per in the urban areas- through distribution by pipes within the Plan period.
"
9682,"In the first four years of the Plan, 71.70 million litres per day were supplied in the rural areas and 52.20 million litres in the urban areas.
"
9683,"Taking into account the possible water supply position in the fifth year, it is expected that the total supply of drinking water will reach 211.20 million litres per day by the end of the Sixth Plan-l07.50 million litres per day in the rural areas and 103.90 million litres in the urban areas.
"
9684,"Thus, only 66.60 percent of the Plan target in water supply is expected to be achieved.
"
9685,"This achievement will supply drinking ""water to 12.20 percent of the total population11.70 percent of the population in the rural areas and 79.90 percent of the population in the urban areas through the pipe system.
"
9686,"OBJECTIVES AND BASIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF THE SEVENTH PLAN
"
9687,"The completion of the Sixth Plan period marks the end of the chapter on the history of nearly three decades  of planned development of the country.
"
9688,"When the country first embarked upon the process of a planned development in the fiscal year 1956/57, inadequate development of infrastructures was the major constraint.
"
9689,"Past efforts in the process of planned development have brought about substantial and significant achievements in the development of physical and social infrastructures.
"
9690,"Based on these achievements, a new chapter was added in the history of development, which led to the inclusion of far-reaching objectives such as fulfilling minimum basic needs of the people.
"
9691,"In the context of drawing up the outline of the Seventh economic development plan of the nation, it is but natural that the picture of the implementation status of the current sixth plan should come up for a brief review.
"
9692,"At the time of the formulation of the sixth plan and thereafter for the first two and a half years of the implementation, on the one hand the attention of the entire nation was concentrated on the important political exercise and on the other, the third year of the plan dawned only to find the country in the grip of a severe drought.
"
9693,"Despite all these, an impressive progress could be achieved during the plan period in major macro-economic indicators such as GDP.
"
9694,"Due to favourable weather conditions, the national production situation remained good in the first two years.
"
9695,"In 1979/80, the base year of the sixth plan, a decrease in GDP because of unfavourable weather conditions took a turn for the better the following year and, as a result, GDP increased abnormally by 8.3 percent.
"
9696,"In the third year, drought conditions held sway over a greater part of the country, bringing about a decline of 1.4 percent in GDP due to a sizeable reduction in agriculture production.
"
9697,"Again in the fourth year, GDP increased by 7.4 percent.
"
9698,"Thus, during the first four years of the plan period; the average annual growth rate of GDP is estimated to be 4.5 percent.
"
9699,"During this period, trends were unfavourable in the government finance monetary, price, foreign trade and  balance of payments situations.
"
9700,"As significant accomplishments remained elusive in the mobilization of revenue, reliance on deficit financing increased to finance public sector expenditures, until it reached the all time high of Rs 2070 million in the fiscal year 1982/83 compared to Rs 960 million in the previous year.
"
9701,"In the fiscal year 1983/84 despite efforts to contain deficit financing, it did fall below the level of Rs 1390 million.
"
9702,"The excessive deficit financing led to the expansion of money supply with its adverse impact on price level and balance of payments position of the country.
"
9703,"During those four years, money supply increased at an annual rate of 14.9 percent and the price at 11 percent per annum.
"
9704,"The continuos increase in imports without corresponding increases in export set the stage for the foreign trade balance to become more and more unfavourable.
"
9705,"Decline in agricultural production due to unpropitious weather conditions followed by heavy pressure on imports, as a result of the deficit financing, disturbed after many years in 1982/83 the balance of payments position of the country as well.
"
9706,"In that year, the country had to face a big deficit of Rs 680 million. In order to reduce the deficits in balance of payments, administrative steps were taken to control import since 1983/84.
"
9707,"Yet in that year also, balance of payments deficit remained at Rs 130 million.
"
9708,"Economic imbalance of this sort created a situation in 1983/84, the fourth year of the plan, where this quantum of public investment had to be kept within strict bounds.
"
9709,"It now appears that the rate of public investment as envisaged in the plan may not at all be possible to maintain.
"
9710,"From a review of the plan implementation of the first four years, it appears that progress in important sectors will lag far behind the targets.
"
9711,"In particular, during the period under review, achievements in power and irrigation, which have a pivotal role to play in expanding the productive capabilities of the economy, were so low that there is a fear that the attempts at rapidly accelerating the growth rate in tile coming plan period may come up against severe obstacles.
"
9712,"Progress of transport sector was good though specially, construction of suspension bridges, which were taken in hand to provide minimum rural transport facilities, failed to keep up a satisfactory rate of progress.
"
9713,"In the expansion of basic health service and drinking water facilities, too, the achievements fell far behind the target set by the plan.
"
9714,"The only exceptions were the education sector where the progress achieved was really encouraging.
"
9715,"In spite of the gap between targets and achievements, the nation was able to achieve some progress in various social and economic sectors.
"
9716,"The irrigation facilities provided under the public sector recorded an increase by 26 percent, bringing the total irrigated area to 251,000 hectares.
"
9717,"The installed power, capacity has been more than doubled to 154 megawatts, which has been proved a great boon to the smooth functioning of industrial enterprises.
"
9718,"Road facilities have gone up by 16 percent to 5,727 Kms.
"
9719,"Similarly, telephone facilities have risen by 48 percent, to 20,580 lines.
"
9720,"Literacy, which was 22.1 percent in 1979/80 has soared to 27.8 percent in 1983/84.
"
9721,"Likewise, the ratio of primary school going age children estimated at 64 percent in 1980, reached 76 percent in 1984.
"
9722,"Remarkable progress has been scored in the fields of lower secondary and secondary education.
"
9723,"The proportion of people enjoying drinking water facilities has increased from 10.6 percent to 18.8 percent.
"
9724,"During this period, serious attempts have been made strengthen institutional bases to stimulate development on various fronts.
"
9725,"In the final year of the plan period (l984/85), agricultural production is expected to be normal.
"
9726,"In the year 1981/82, the 60 megawatt Kulekhani Project was commissioned. It was followed in the year 1983/84 by the completion of the Devighat project, which added 14.1 megawatt to the national grid. This led to the substantially improvement in power supply position which in turn contributed a great deal to overcome bottleneck affecting the establishment and operation of industries, and this is therefore expected to spur industrial activities.
"
9727,"For these reasons, GDP is expected to increase by 4 percent this year.
"
9728,"Thus, there is a strong probability that the average annual growth rate during the entire Sixth Plan period will be 4.4 percent.
"
9729,"But the base year 1979/80 of the sixth plan was a bad year from the point of view of production.
"
9730,"If the average annual growth rate of the later four-year of the Plan period is considered, the growth rate comes to be 3.4 percent.
"
9731,"The target of the GDP growth rate of the sixth plan is 4.3 percent.
"
9732,"Although success has been scored in gaining limited goals, one cannot lose sight of the fact, first, that the execution of the plan has failed to proceed at the prescribed rate and, secondly, that no dynamism has been introduced in the development of the economy.
"
9733,"Agricultural sector, the source of livelihood and employment of the bulk of the population, continues to lean heavily on uncertain weather conditions.
"
9734,"Significant achievements in enhancing agricultural production and productivity are yet to be realized.
"
9735,"land, the principal source of fuel supply, is shrinking rather than increasing in area.
"
9736,"Mounting erosion and landslide are undermining the base of the hill economy.
"
9737,"On the other hand, the sharp rise in population is compounding the already complex economic problems.
"
9738,"Failure to boost the production of traditional export goods has created situation where whatever is produced has to be diverted to meeting the needs of the growing population. Another fact that has weakened the export sector is that no new exportable items have been identified and created.
"
9739,"On the other hand, sluggishness in taking firm steps designed to streamline and strengthen development administration has cast a shadow on the implementation of projects. This, in turn, has made the economy incapable of putting to good use the resources provided under the foreign aid.
"
9740,"In this connection, it may be pointed out that the indigenous populations are not getting advantages from whatever job openings are being created by investments.
"
9741,"Viewed against this background, it becomes patently clear that mere mouthing of catchy slogans or coining of claptrap phrases cannot be relied upon to overcome the problems the nation is facing today as well as those which it will be saddled with tomorrow.
"
9742,"The problems are there, standing out bright and clear, so are the means of getting to grips with them.
"
9743,"Principal challenge of today is to resolutely put into effects those known means. In this context, the Seventh Plan should be viewed against the background of the following challenges: 
"
9744,"(a) To narrow down the gulf between planning and implementation, between word and deed, and to step forward to carry out what has been laid down and translate the vision into reality,
"
9745,"(b) To focus the entire attention and endeavour of the nation on the tasks of increasing production and employment opportunities, and fulfilling the minimum basic needs of the common man as laid down so clearly in the sixth plan,
"
9746,"(c) To build up the productive capabilities of the economy on the basis of the development of land and water resources, which form the physical endowments of the nation,
"
9747,"(d) To devote proper attention to conserving and expanding the natural wealth, and
"
9748,"(e) To take steps to tackle the population problems.
"
9749,"From this, it follows that what is needed is to concentrate our efforts towards giving concrete shapes to the  objectives and development policies singled out in the current plan instead of talking about additional things and  hunting for new catchwords in the course of the Seventh Plan period.
"
9750,"If this is to be the line of action, certain amendments and alterations will have to be made in the development policies of the Seventh Plan, keeping in view those additional challenges that have emerged during the Sixth Plan period.
"
9751,"Nevertheless, the basic approach should be not so much to scatter the limited financial resources at our disposal as to concentrate them on matters of top priorities as enunciated in the plan itself.
"
9752,"Similarly, in view of the limited financial resources and shortage of technical manpower, the current projects and programmes may have to be subjected to a close scrutiny, and steps taken to strike out those that are either inconsistent with the objectives and development strategies of the plan or very low in priority rating.
"
9753,"In conclusion, besides dedicating the political will and commitment to economic development, which is a logical thing to do against the background of the political stability prevailing in the country, effective implementation of the Seventh Plan largely hinges on two things.
"
9754,"One of them is to be able to build up an atmosphere, which will allow an efficient harnessing of internal resources, and another is to give added strength and competence to development administration and to create such conditions as are designed to encourage the government employees to dedicate themselves to nation building under a new wave of eagerness, excitement and enthusiasm.
"
9755,"Absence of these two things will mean that we shall once again fail in our attempt at bridging the gap between what we say and what we do; 
"
9756,"Moreover, to increase the tempo of local development works, the panchayat sector should be galvanized into action with a greater sense of accountability, and emphasis should be laid on topping local organizational set-ups, local leaderships and local resources to meet the minimum basic needs of the local people and also in responding to the demand for local development in line with the spirit of the principles of decentralization.
"
9757,"While working out the draft of the coming Seventh Plan, it has been the endeavour to keep the above mentioned points in mind constantly and unfailingly.
"
9758,"Objectives:
"
9759,"Development goals of a nation are necessarily long term. That is why it is not generally found desirable to tamper with those objectives that the nation is striving for until they are fully achieved.
"
9760,"They cannot be achieved within a short time-span.
"
9761,"The rationale of periodic plans is to attain those objectives, and they are designed solely with that end in view.
"
9762,"Looked at from the standpoint of our economic conditions and realities, the objectives laid down in the Sixth Plan are of equal relevance and significance today. As the nation will still need a long time to reach those objectives, they have been set forth as the objectives of the Seventh Plan also.
"
9763,"They are:
"
9764,"(a) To increase production at a higher rate
"
9765,"The momentous challenge facing the nation has been the ways and means of increasing production and purchasing power.
"
9766,"The existing problems of indigence and unemployment cannot be sorted out till the productive capacity of the nation and purchasing power of the people were stepped up.
"
9767,"Also, without raising productivity the concept of social justice will be no more than a vision and a dream-a shadow without substance.
"
9768,"Such is the hard economic reality of ours today.
"
9769,"In the decade ranging from 1971/72 to 1981/82 national production has succeeded in growing at the rate of 3 percent per annum, whereas the population has started growing by 2.66 percent every year.
"
9770,"And as the agricultural sector failed to register substantial achievements, the development pace of the economy has been clogged up.
"
9771,"Since there is a close and intimate inter-relationship between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, lack of dynamism in  the former has had the effect of limiting both the speed and scope of development in the latter.
"
9772,"Dull and insipid growth of production cannot lead to the growth of the capacity to save, nor can it breathe a new life in the export trade.
"
9773,"Over the past several years population has been growing at a rate much faster than the national production, with the result that our development processes have been barely enough to sustain the increasing pressure of population, leaving us with nothing to push up the economic standard of the broad masses.
"
9774,"There are signs that the performance of the sixth plan in terms of economic growth rate will be slightly better than its predecessor, but as the population has started growing at a faster rate than in the preceding years, the end result can be expected to be no more than a marginal improvement in the standard of living.
"
9775,"Not that there is a lack of enough potential for stepping up production.
"
9776,"The agricultural sector is no exception in this regard.
"
9777,"From the demonstrations of the research farms and the actual crop outputs of the pioneer peasants, it has been seen that farm output can be increased by three to four times more than at present.
"
9778,"Nor do we lack the skill and technology to boost production to that extent.
"
9779,"True it is that our peasants are mostly unlettered, but that does not mean that they are not endowed with the intellectual capacity to utilize those techniques with full knowledge and understanding.
"
9780,"What is wanted is nothing but the means to place those techniques within their reach to provide them with sufficient amount of irrigation water, production tools and equipments required for the use of those techniques, and to ensure an effective framework within which they can hope to get a fair price for the larger number of things produced by their labour and investment.
"
9781,"This is not to say that no attempt has so far been made to bring such a set-up to birth.
"
9782,"But it appears that much more remains to be done to make it a viable unit.
"
9783,"is another our national resources, and its development is necessary for the overall development of the economy.
"
9784,"Through the effective conservation and utilization of these resources we can fulfill a number of multifaceted economic necessities of the nation-fuel woods to cook food; charcoal and raw materials to keep the industries running; timbers to build houses; fodder for animal husbandry; herbs to manufacture medicine; national parks for the development of tourism industry; soil conservation to maintain and keep up the fertility of land and to prevent disastrous floods and landslides.
"
9785,"What we need now, however, is to make a Herculean effort to grapple with the problems arising out of the indiscriminate destruction of our forest resources.
"
9786,"On our nation has nature conferred an almost limitless wealth in the form of water, holding infinite development prospects for our economy.
"
9787,"Much of the future development of our economy rests on the judicious and effective use of this vast resource.
"
9788,"It can playa big part in the promotion of energy based industries, in the creation of electric- powered transportation system, and in the increment of our export capabilities along with rapid advances in electrification, irrigation, drinking water facilities, fish farming and tourism.
"
9789,"It is, therefore, essential that further efforts be made to ensure a mu lti-purpose development and use of this valuable resource with our sights firmly set on its long-run prospects.
"
9790,"Although the full range of infrastructures required for a speedier industrialization programme has yet to come into being, it does not mean that there are no chances open to those who are willing to set up industries by optimizing the use of whatever basic conditions have been created.
"
9791,"Tourism has now appeared on the scene as a viable modern source of increasing foreign exchange receipts of the country.
"
9792,"It has no less an important role to play as a generation of income and employment. Increasing efforts should be made to develop tourism on a big scale and in a planned way.
"
9793,"To ensure a fast growth of production, attention should be turned to the maximum utilization of facilities already installed.
"
9794,"According to available data, only 42 percent of the capacity of irrigation projects are being tapped.
"
9795,"From this, it follows that additional acreage can reap the benefit from irrigation facilities by improving the distribution networks alone if nothing else.
"
9796,"In the areas having transport facilities, attempt should be made to develop horticulture  and livestock for commercial purposes, and to set up small industries by taking advantage of the opportunities opened up by surface transportation.
"
9797,"Attempts also can be made to foster increase industrial output by running the industries already commissioned in the public and private sectors to their full capacity.
"
9798,"Areas that hold promise for quick production against small investment should be identified, and the flow of investment should be channeled that way.
"
9799,"(b) To increase opportunities for productive employment
"
9800,"The problem of employment has been further exacerbated by the steep growth of population.
"
9801,"According to  the census report 1981, the labour force has been augmented by 2 million within inter censul decade 1971-1981, which works out to an annual increment of 0.2 million.
"
9802,"As job opportunities in non-agricultural sectors could not be created to the requisite extent, the pressure on agriculture, which has the dubious distinction of employing the greatest number of people, went on increasing.
"
9803,"The growth rate in the agricultural sector itself has been rather slow and leisurely.
"
9804,"This problem has already assumed formidable proportion in the hill areas, in particular, where lands that can be brought under the plough are limited.
"
9805,"At the same time, educated unemployment seems to be on the increase.
"
9806,"The ultimate aim of any economic development is nothing else but to upgrade the living standard of the people at large an aim, which can be realized on condition that production and employment are stepped up considerably.
"
9807,"The living standard of the bulk of the population can be pushed up through the creation of jobs.
"
9808,"More jobs mean distribution of income among a wider section of the population.
"
9809,"To include the employment-oriented development policy, in the Seventh Plan is , therefore, relevant to the present context also.
"
9810,"In view of the structure of the country's economy, the only source which can lead to the multiplication of employment, opportunities to a large extent seems to be a faster development of the agricultural sector.
"
9811,"The scope of the non-agricultural sectors being very narrow at present, they cannot be expected to provide employment to a large segment of the population, no matter how fast is the rate of development of these sectors.
"
9812,"In the decade between 1971 and 1981, this sector has been able to absorb only 17 percent (338,000) of the growing population, leaving the balance of 83 percent (1,660,000) with no choice except to have recourse to the agricultural sector.
"
9813,"Again, the expansion of the non-agricultural sector is conditioned by the growth of the agricultural sector.
"
9814,"To take the case of rural areas, agricultural growth helps increase employment by engendering economic activities in non-agricultural areas.
"
9815,"It is, therefore, essential that from the point of view of multiplying job opportunities also overall priority be now given to agricultural development.
"
9816,"To expand the scope of employment in the industrial sector, the imperatives of the limited internal market require that priority be accorded to the development of small, labour-intensive industries.
"
9817,"If the labour intensive industrial development policy is to be made effective, .it must be ensured that the policies governing, in particular, the industrial tax and credit concessions together with the industrial wages and labour welfare schemes are not devised in such a way as to provide impetus to heavily capital intensive industrial investments.
"
9818,"Foreign trade policies also should be put into effect in a manner supportive of increasing employment opportunities within the country.
"
9819,"To this end, stress should be laid on export - promoting manufacturing activities and concentrated attention should be given to producing and exporting agro-allied and labour oriented commodities.
"
9820,"Improvement in the productivity and income level of workers is contingent upon the quality of work.
"
9821,"Currently, unskilled labour occupies a dominant position in the aggregate labour force. Not only has this situation kept the domestic productivity at a lower level. Short supply of indigenous people who can offer the kind of skill on demand in the market has triggered an inflow of foreign labour.
"
9822,"It has become, therefore, all the more important that vocational and skill-oriented trainings be evolved to make the workforce of the country more efficient and skillful.
"
9823,"Moreover, it is high time that steps be taken to ban the unrestricted entry of foreign nationals in order to create conditions where our own compatriots are enabled to take full advantage of the new avenues opened up in the country as a result of economic development
"
9824,"(c) To fulfill the minimum basic needs of the people:
"
9825,"As the resources available for investment are limited, a decision should be taken on where to guide the flow of investment and for the purpose of increasing the supply of which commodities or services.
"
9826,"It will be recalled that  the target set by the sixth plan was to channel investment to meet the minimum basic needs of the people.
"
9827,"During the Seventh Plan period also, it is necessary that the following be viewed as the minimum basic needs and that all attempts be centered on meeting them:
"
9828,"1) Food grain 
"
9829,"2) Clothing 
"
9830,"3) Fuelwood
"
9831,"4) Drinking water
"
9832,"5) Primary health cares and sanitation 
"
9833,"6) Primary and skill-based education and
"
9834,"7) Minimum rural transport facilities.
"
9835,"Foodgrain:
"
9836,"Food is the basic of all human needs.
"
9837,"Man can work with any enthusiasm only when he has enough to eat and is healthy.
"
9838,"It is, therefore, not only essential but indispensable to invest in raising food production as much as possible.
"
9839,"Although investment has regularly been made in increasing food production over the past so many years, we  have failed in our attempt to keep the growth of food production in step with the rise in population.
"
9840,"In the decade between 1971 and 1981 our population has grown from 11,556,000 to 15,023,000 (a growth of 30 percent), while foodgrain production within the same period climbed from 3,486,000 metric tons to 3,829,000 metric tons (a gain of 10 percentage points only).
"
9841,"As population growth has started out-stripping the volume of food production, the amount of supply available for internal consumption as dwindled more and more.
"
9842,"Food production has now reached a level where it cannot be deemed sufficient to meet the minimum nutritional needs of the people.
"
9843,"In the hill areas, food crisis is now so frequent that it has almost become an annual feature and the food deficit districts have been increasing in number.
"
9844,"The rising cost of food distribution has exerted increasing pressure on the budget year after year.
"
9845,"As a consequence of population growth, the foodgrain savings of the - Terai region have started declining, and as an increasing amount of the decreasing savings is being dispatched to the hills, foodrain export has plummeted, throwing the foreign trade off balance.
"
9846,"From the food crises arising out of the drought of 1979/80 and 1982/83 it has become more than clear that our foodgrains production position has come down to a really wretched level.
"
9847,"It is clear that in the present situation all our attention and attempts be irrevocably committed to increase adequate food grain production.
"
9848,"We shall be able to give proper attention to other acts of economic development only if our all out assault on the food production is crowned with success.
"
9849,"Clothing:
"
9850,"Another thing essential to the daily life of the people is clothing.
"
9851,"Being a country with different climates, we require clothing suited to summer and winter conditions.
"
9852,"At the moment we have to depend largely on foreign countries to meet our clothing requirements.
"
9853,"Since there is an extensive market within the country, various kinds of cloth can be produced indigenously.
"
9854,"The crying need is to launch solid programmes in the country for the production of essential raw materials.
"
9855,"Industrial demands of those items that cannot be produced internally or that can be produced only to prohibitive costs can be met by import.
"
9856,"Being a labour intensive enterprise textile industry has the potential of generating employment opportunities in abundance.
"
9857,"It has, therefore, become a thing of paramount importance that steps be taken to develop textile industry in a planned manner and on a wider scale.
"
9858,"Clothing is one of the basic necessities of the general public and therefore, its production cost is to be at the minimum level and economical.
"
9859,"Excessive protection of this industry is not desirable from the viewpoint of overall industrial development of the country.
"
9860,"If imported clothes sell at a cheaper rate than the comparable indigenous products, the goal of providing people with low cost clothing will remain unfulfilled.
"
9861,"For this reason, the formulation of textile industry development policies and drawing up of requisite plans should be preceded by a detailed study on the various technical and economic aspects involved in the development of textile industries within the country.
"
9862,"Fuelwood
"
9863,"The next thing that should draw our attention after food and clothing is firewood.
"
9864,"The bulk of our household requirement for fuel, whether for cooking or heating, are met by fuelwood.
"
9865,"In the case of the rural families, wood is the only source of energy.
"
9866,"However much we increase our investment in the generation of hydro-electricity, it will be quite a long time before wood is supplal1ted by electricity, particularly in view of the fact that to an ordinary household, electricity cannot rival wood in price.
"
9867,"As the purchasing power of our rural population is very low and the cost of production, very high, they will not be able to afford electricity for many more years to come.
"
9868,"Under the present circumstances wood would remain to be the cheapest source of energy for t he majority of our people compared to other energy alternatives.'
"
9869,"But our forest resources have been badly depleted within the last two decades chiefly on account of the high  growth of population.
"
9870,"In the 15 years between 1963/64 and 1978/79 the area covered by forest had shrunk from 6.4 million hectares to 4.3 million hectares.
"
9871,"Of this, the land under forest is estimated to have shrunk from 4.6 million hectares to 3.9 million hectares in the mountain and from 1.8 million hectares to 0.4 million hectares in the Terai.
"
9872,"In other words, 15 percent of the forest in the mountainous region and 78 percent in Terai have been decimated bringing the total to 33 percent.
"
9873,"Depletion of forest in the neighborhood of villages and other human settlements has forced the inhabitants to spend a longer and longer time in gathering firewood.
"
9874,"As it has become more and more difficult to stock up enough firewood they are being forced to fall back upon the sun dried cakes of cow-dung as a supplementary source of fuel, at the cost of fertility of soil.
"
9875,"Of all the thing, the most serious is that forests that are left with us are not enough to meet the annual fuel needs of the people.
"
9876,"This is a situation, which helps intensify the depredations.
"
9877,"If we fail to take rapid steps to tackle this problem on a war footing, the situation will go from bad to worse.
"
9878,"According to studies made on the status of the forest wealth, it has been found that if the present rates of ravages are to go on unchecked, there will be not a single patch of forest left in the country within the next two decades.
"
9879,"The national demand for fuelwood cannot now be met on a short-term basis.
"
9880,"Even if we draw up a plan to meet our annual requirements in the course of the next two decades, we shall have to put a degree of effort far greater than what we are used to now.
"
9881,"According to a study made in this connection this target will be achievable only if we go on increasing the tree plantation rate in such a way as to cover an area of 50,000 hectares by 1990 and 120,000 hectares by 2000.
"
9882,"The present rate of afforestation stands at 6 or 7 thousand hectares per year.
"
9883,"From this one can easily form an idea about how extensive the scope of the tree plantation programme should be.
"
9884,"To step up the supply of firewood, reforestation and conservation programmes should be launched in the form of a campaign, particularly in areas close to human habitations both rural and urban.
"
9885,"Effective steps should also be taken to implement such programmes by the panchayat and private sectors on a commercial basis.
"
9886,"Drinking Water
"
9887,"Another basic necessity is drinking water.
"
9888,"By the end of the terminal year of the Fifth Plan, 1979/80, the facility of piped water was extended to 1,548,000 of the population.
"
9889,"According to the census of 1981, the total population of the country is estimated to have reached 14,634,000.
"
9890,"It will thus be seen that the population covered by the piped water distribution system stood at 10.6 percent in 1979/80.
"
9891,"In the fourth year of the sixth plan, 1983/84, this facility was brought within the reach of 2,545,000 persons, which constituted 17.7 per cent of the estimated population (16,253,000) of that year.
"
9892,"In the hill region, in particular, human settlements are usually long way off from sources of water. In such a situation housewives have to devote a lot of time and energy to the task of fetching water-time and energy, which could have been better spent on some productive work. Further, contaminated water is at the root of all kinds of diseases.
"
9893,"If enough poTable water can be supplied, the time spent on bringing water can be diverted to productive works, which will naturally, help raise the productivity and income of the family. Besides, the resulting control of waterborne diseases will improve the health status of the people and push up the level of their productivity.
"
9894,"That is why it is deemed essential that priority be assigned to expand the coverage of drinking water facility in the Seventh Plan.
"
9895,"Primary health care and sanitation
"
9896,"Emphasis has all along been placed on the expansion of the primary health care services as it happens to be the only way by which minimum health facilities to the rural population can be ensured.
"
9897,"The number of health posts, which were to serve as the institutional medium for the delivery if the health care package, was increased year by year until it reached 744 in 1983/84.
"
9898,"The present ratio between health posts and population is 1: 21, 845.
"
9899,"There is a great need for multiplying their number with all speed so that people can derive benefit from whatever curative and preventive measures they are competent and equipped to provide. In addition, it is also urgently required that the quality of services made available through these health posts be improved appreciably.
"
9900,"At the same time, enough attention should be given to both rural and urban sanitation.
"
9901,"Most of the diseases spring from ignorance and environmental pollution.
"
9902,"To convince the people of the virtues of cleanliness, a publicity campaign should be mounted, using both the educational and publicity and broadcasting media.
"
9903,"In this connection, it is most appropriate to activate village and town panchayats in such campaigns.
"
9904,"Primary and skill-based education and adult education
"
9905,"Literate and skilled labour is a pre-requisite to the all-round development of the nation.
"
9906,"For this reason, any attempt directed at providing literacy and skill to the greatest number of people within the shortest possible time is a matter of national priority.
"
9907,"During the Sixth Plan period, much has been achieved in this direction.
"
9908,"In 1983/84, the fourth year of the sixth plan, 76 percent of the children of primary-school age are estimated to have been enjoying primary education facilities.
"
9909,"Until the above-mentioned year, literate population reached 27.8 per cent of the total population. Some progress was made in the development of technical and vocational education.
"
9910,"Efforts in those directions should be continued in the years lying ahead.
"
9911,"Minimum rural transport facility
"
9912,"Transport has a highly significant part to play in a country like ours where the topography is dominated by mountains, rivers and streams.
"
9913,"Development of transport links hitherto isolated pockets and settlements to developing areas and incorporates them with the stream of national economic development.
"
9914,"It also makes it possible to explore new avenues of development. But on the other hand, investment in the construction of costly motorable roads of modern standard cannot be economically justifiable in those mountain regions where due to the backward state of their economies the volume of traffic tends to remain low.
"
9915,"At the moment the policy will be to construct truck worthy single lane jeepable mud roads in such areas, depending on the density of traffic of each place, and to build mule tracks, suspension and wooden bridges to link up the villages with near by periodic markets and other commercial outlets. This will be the suitable investment policy to be adopted as part of the effort to provide minimum transport facilities in the rural areas.
"
9916,"Later, as economic activities go on expanding, creating a correspondingly bigger volume of traffic, the roads designed for vehicular traffic can be widened and then gravelled and macadamized.
"
9917,"As things stand now, the most appropriate transport development policy will be to link up a maximum number of places at the minimum level of cost.
"
9918,"Basic development strategies
"
9919,"To achieve the development objectives of the Seventh Plan, investment and efforts will have to be devoted to two directions simultaneously.
"
9920,"The first direction is to help utilize to the full extent the infrastructures already created and to concentrate investment on programmes that are likely to boost production without undue loss of time.
"
9921,"Secondly, the level of investment will be increased in the creation of those basic pre-requisites, which are essential to the strengthening of the foundations of the economy and to the quickening of the tempo of development in the years to come.
"
9922,"If owing to resource constraint simultaneous advance on both these fronts is not possible, priority will be accorded to the first line of action.
"
9923,"Subject to this fundamental investment policy, the following shall constitute our basic development strategies to achieve the objectives of the Seventh Plan.
"
9924,"a) To accord overall priority to the development of agricultural sector
"
9925,"In the present state of our country, to impart dynamism to agricultural sector is a matter of paramount importance, if we really mean to increase our production multiply employment opportunities and fulfil the minimum need of the people.
"
9926,"Agriculture has been the source of income and employment to the majority of the people.
"
9927,"Poverty is most rampant in the agricultural sector.
"
9928,"Hence, to lift up the standard of living of the majority of the poor people, it is imperative that the agricultural sector be developed and advanced.
"
9929,"Development of agricultural sector is essential to the industrialization of the country and the promotion of export trade.
"
9930,"Industrial products will enjoy a bigger market if the purchasing power of the farmers can be strengthened.
"
9931,"Similarly, the supply of industrial raw materials becomes possible only when the agricultural sector is developed and expanded.
"
9932,"If we succeed in increasing the volume of production of foodgrains and other farm products in plenty and at low cost, the wages of industrial workers and prices of raw materials will remain at a low level, making our industries more able to stand up to international competition.
"
9933,"If industrial commodities can be produced at a cheaper rate, they will be widely accepted in the domestic market. And in this process the foundations of industrial development will be consolidated.
"
9934,"At the present stage, the development of export sector also hings on our capacity to boost up agriculture production.
"
9935,"Thus, from all considerations, since agricultural has to play a substantial role in the economic advancement of the country, it is essential to assigne top priority to this sector during the Seventh Plan period also.
"
9936,"Hence, with agriculture as the focal point, the policy will be to lay the development of economy on a strong foundation by linking up the development bases of industry and export trade with the progress of this sector.
"
9937,"b) To put stress on the development of forest resources and the soil conservation
"
9938,"Prominent among the less costly sources meeting the mounting fuel needs of the rural household at present is forest. It will continue to occupy this position of pre-eminence until we are able to extensively develop the water resources or enhance the income level of the village folk. For this reason alone, if for nothing else, development and promotion of the forest wealth deserves preference.
"
9939,"To combat the serious problems facing the villagers on account of the destruction of forest, tree plantation programmes will be conducted on a war footing. The existing forest will be developed and improved under scientific management, and wide-ranging programmes will be launched to increase the production of firewood and timbers.
"
9940,"Besides, to relieve the pressure on forest, programmes in large numbers will be put under way to popularize the use of fuel-efficient stoves and bio-gas plants. As a result of the depredations of the forest wealth and cultivation of hill slopes, flood and landslide disasters are on the increase, and the fertility of the high lands is on the wane.
"
9941,"These problems, which were born of the ecological imbalances, should now be taken up very seriously. To this end, soil and watershed conservation programmes will be carried out on a wider scale.
"
9942,"As these programmes are very costly and have wide ramifications, it will be necessary, on the one hand, to strengthen the means of enlisting popular participation in their implementation and to fix priorities in their implementation on the basis of urgency before initiating them, on the other.
"
9943,"In addition, the present land use situation will be studied on its basis, policies and programmes relating to land use will be drawn up and put into effect.
"
9944,"Past Development Efforts, Achievements and Constraints
"
9945,"Introduction:
"
9946,"The Eighth Plan is the first plan of the democratic government formed through popular elections following the restoration of democracy brought about by the historic people's ovement of 1990.
"
9947,"In this context, the perspectives of this plan are based on two principal contradictory factors.
"
9948,"These factors consist of, on the one hand, the positive aspects of the new aspirations and enthusiasm among the general public and, on the other, the negative aspects of the legacy of economic depravity left behind by the panchayat regime.
"
9949,"The present challenge of the plan is to strike and effective balance between the ever growing needs and rising expectations of the rapidly increasing population and the limited available financial and natural resources.
"
9950,"This challenge has been further compounded by the degradation of natural resources and environment.
"
9951,"These circumstances naturally call for political discipline, thrift and economic sacrifices.
"
9952,"Under these trying conditions, too, the great expectations and enthusiasm obtaining among the people can serve as a primary source of energy for the process of economic modernization.
"
9953,"During the period prior the the restoration of democracy, a three year plan and five year Plans were formulated and implemented.
"
9954,"The distortions in policy matters, strategies and programmers as well as the weakness in implementation evolved as the characteristic features of the then periodic development planning process.
"
9955,"An evaluation of the major economic and physical indicators during this period presents a gloomy picture, Although during the panchayat regime progress was made to a certain extent in areas like transportation, communication, health, drinking water, literacy and the ratio of student enrolments, but the economic achievements were vague and disappointing on the whole.
"
9956,"No economic changes were brought about in the life style of the majority of the population.
"
9957,"The economic condition of some segments of population deteriorated even further. An analysis of the economic changes brought about by the planned development efforts in the past in presented below.
"
9958,"Economic situation:
"
9959,"1. Gross Domestic Product:
"
9960,"Owing to the low growth rate in Gross Domestic Product in Comparison with the high growth rate in population, the per-capita income recorded only a marginal increase during the period 1964/65 to 1989/90.
"
9961,"During this period, the average annual growth in GDP was 3.4 precent whereas the growth in per capita income was a mere 0.8 percent.
"
9962,"In absolute terms, the per capita income reached Rs 1,605 in 1989.90 as against Rs 1,304 in 1964/65.
"
9963,"Thus, in a period of 26 years, the increase in per capita income was merely rs. 301 at 1974/75 prices.
"
9964,"At constant prices the GDP had increased by 3.4 percent during the prices the GD P had increased by 3.4 precent during the period 1964/65 to 1989.90 by recording the growth rate of 3 percant in agricultural sector and 3.8 percent in non-agricultural sectors.
"
9965,"In the past, especially during the seventh plan period (1985-1990), it was estimated that there had occurred an unprecedented growth in agricultural production.
"
9966,"In reality, records of cultivated areas previously left out were adjusted after cadastral surveys which led to an increase in the crop farming area giving rise to inflated estimates of agricultural production.
"
9967,"Thus, the growth in GDP during this period appeared to be unrealistically high.
"
9968,"Efforts are currently underway to rectify this situation. If the aforementioned unrealistic growth were excluded, the growth rate in per-capita income during the seventh plant would be considerably lower.
"
9969,"As a result of the low economic growth rate and the widening economic and income disparities, a process to push many more people below the poverty line was intensified.
"
9970,"Various studies have been conducted for the purpose of quantifying the people living below the poverty line in Nepal.
"
9971,"These studies have estimated that 40-60 percent of the populations are living below the absolute poverty line.
"
9972,"According to the National Planning Commission estimates based on the assessment of available data, the percentage of the people living below the poverty line is put at about 49 percent.
"
9973,"Thus, a large segment of population is deprived of the basic necessities of life.
"
9974,"There had been no marked changes in the economic structure until the fall of the panchayat regime.
"
9975,"The  share of the agricultural sector in GDP was 65.1 percent in 1964/65, which recorded a slight downward trend by reaching 61 percent in 1989/90. while the share of the non-agricultural sector in GDP ought to have grown commensurate with industrialization in the course of development, it is estimated to have recorded merely 39 precent in 1989/90, by recording a low growth rate as against 34.9 in 1964.65.
"
9976,"Thus, it is evident that there were no substantial improvements in the macro economic structure of the country.
"
9977,"In addition, the mode of producti8ion continued to be traditional. Due to the lack of growth in employment opportunities in non-agricultural sectors, the labour force subsisting on agriculture could not be transferred to other sectors.
"
9978,"The reliance of the growing labour force on agricultural pursuit where labour productivity was already low led to a further decline in per capita production in agriculture.
"
9979,"The problem has been further compounded by the fact that the agricultural labour force has to rely excessively on the monsoon.
"
9980,"Foodgrain production which stood at 3.152 million metric tones in 1961/62 reached only 5.698 million metric tones in 1989/90 with an average growth rate of 2.1 percent per annum only. This increase, again, was due mainly to the expansion in the agricultural land reather than an increase in productivity or the use of agricultural inputs.
"
9981,"The efforts of this period were insufficient even to maintain past levels of average per capita agricultural production.
"
9982,"The per capita food grain availability was diversely affected owing to the low growth rate in food grain supply in comparison to the growth rate in population.
"
9983,"In the irrigation sector, too, only 550,467 hectares of land had access to irrigation facility by 1989/90which comprised only 21 percent of the total land under cultivation.
"
9984,"Notwithstanding the encouragement provided for the development of the industrial sector in the past, this sector remained in its rudimentary stage.
"
9985,"The share of the manufacturing sector including cottage industries stood at about 5 percent of GDP and provided employment to only about 2 percent of the total labour force.
"
9986,"The sector lacked dynamism and was unable to establish the kind of growth which induces forward and backward linkages with other sectors of the economy.
"
9987,"Although the growth rate of this sector in general has been marginally higher the that of the economy as a whole, some industrial units prospered as a result of protectionist policies. This is, however, incompatible with the general trends towards economic liberalization.
"
9988,"Capacity utilization in industries, profit yielding and investment with value added activities were slake.
"
9989,"No sub-sector under the industrial sector was able to attract either domestic or foreign investors.
"
9990,"2. Investment and savings:
"
9991,"In order to enhance the production capacity of the national economy it is essential to channelize an increased share of GDP to investment.
"
9992,"Again, to increase the quantum of investment, there had to be a concomitant reduction in consumption expenditure and increase in gross domestic savings.
"
9993,"Instead, the total consumption expenditure during the past 16 years rose from 90 percent of GDP in 1974-75 to 93.9 percent in 1989.90. this was mainly due to the increase in government expenditure from 7.6 percent of GDP in 1974/75 to 11.5 percent.
"
9994,"3. Government Financial Situation:
"
9995,"Consequently, this gave rise to anomalies and distortions in the economy and, in turn, adversely affected the pace and structure of economic development.
"
9996,"3.1 	Development Expenditure:
"
9997,"These growth rates were insufficient to cope with the increasing development expenditure.
"
9998,"Consequently, this led to an increased and heavy dependence of the economy on foreign aid.
"
9999,"a. Revenue Surplus: During the period between 1972/73 and 1989/90 the revenue increased at the rate of 17.3 percent at current prices and 6.9 percent at constant prices.
"
10000,"A structural analysis of the revenue reveals that it depended entirely upon traditional sources of revenue, as new revenue sources were not tapped.
"
10001,"The contribution of taxes to GDP stood at 2.3 percent at constant prices from indirect taxes and 0.8 percent from direct taxes in 1972/73, which rose to 4.0 percent and 0.9 percent respectively in 1989/90. in the past years the regular expenditure recorded an unprecedented high growth.
"
10002,"The regular expenditure increased by 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at constant prices during the period from 1972/73 to 1989/90 the regular expenditure compared to GDP was 6 percent at current prices in 1972/73, which reached 7.3 in 1989/90.
"
10003,"Thus, at constant prices the regular expenditure recorded as growth from 2.8 percent in 1972/73 to 4.5 percent in 1989/90.
"
10004,"A detailed analysis reveals that there occurred a fundamental directional change in regular expenditure from the fiscal year 1974/75.
"
10005,"There was and accelerated growth in the expenditure in defence, internal security and debt servicing.
"
10006,"Consequently, the share of the regular expenditure in economic and social sectors showed a decline in the total regular expenditure.
"
10007,"This phenomenon corroborates the fact that the economy is increasingly becoming dependent on loans and the flow if financial resources channeled directly towards economic and social services for development is very much limited.
"
10008,"In addition, the expenditure under the economic services for the maintenance if physical infrastructures, which were created with large investment, remained low.
"
10009,"All these factors hindered a substantial growth in revenue surplus.
"
10010,"The revenue surplus stood at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product at current prices in 1974/75 and 2 percent in 1972/73 at constant prices. This figure remained at 2.9 percents at current prices and 1.8 percent at constant prices in 1989/90.
"
10011,"b. Deficit Finance: Thus, the mobilistation of deficit finance became an important tool of resource mobilistation due to the decline in the revenue surplus and the lack of optimum utilization of foreign aid.
"
10012,"The rate of growth in deficit financing from 1972/73 to 1989/90 was 18.4 percent at current prices and 7.9 percent at 1972/73 constant prices.
"
10013,"The share of deficit finance in gro ss domestic product, which stood at 0.9 percent in 1972/73, increased to 1.7 percent in 1989/90 at 1972/73 constant prices.
"
10014,"Furthermore, due to the relatively simpler loan procedures of the banks, internal loans were mostly obtained from the banking sector.
"
10015,"This, however, led to a further rise in the price level prevailing in the economy.
"
10016,"c. 	Foreign Assistance: Due to limited internal revenue mobilistation, there was a growing reliance on foreign assistance for development expenditure.
"
10017,"There appeared there significant trends in forging assistance during this period.
"
10018,"Firstly, there was a gradual increase in the share of foreign assistance in the development expenditure.
"
10019,"While the foreign assistance contributed 37.4 percent of total development expenditure in 1972/73, the figure increased to 61.1 percent in 1989/90.
"
10020,"Secondly, the foreign assistance received by the country recorded a progressive decline in grant assistance and a commensurate increase in loans. While loans constituted only 20.8 percent of total forging assistance in 1972/73, the percentage rose to 75.1 in 1989/90. this resulted in an increased burden on the economy of the payment of foreign debts and their interest.
"
10021,"Thirdly, compared to the amount of loans sanctioned by foreign donor countries and agencies, their actual utilistation remained considerably low. Thus, the rapid growth in net foreign debts led to an increased burden on the economy.
"
10022,"While the outstanding foreign debt obligation stood at Rs 173.4 million (US$ 17.1 million) in 1972/73, i.e.1.6 percent of gross domestic product, Rs 36,800.9 million (US$ 1260.3 million) i.e.40.5 percent of gross domestic product.
"
10023,"Thus, the debt obligations increased from 2.0 percent in 1972/73 to 42.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1989/90.1
"
10024,"Due to the expansionary fiscal policies adopted during this period, the gross expenditure recorded and average annual growth rate of approximately 17 percent from fiscal years 1964/65 to 1989/90.
"
10025,"The level of total expenditure in gross domestic product was at 5 percent in 1964/65, which reached 22 percent in 1989/90.
"
10026,"On the other hand, during the same period, the share of revenue in gross domestic product reached to only 10 percent from 3 percent.
"
10027,"Consequently, the gap between revenue and expenditure reached as high as 12 percent from 3 percent.
"
10028,"This led to an increased dependence on internal and external borrowings.
"
10029,"Thus, the existing state of government finance clearly reflects its gradual weakening over the years. Due to insufficient mobilization of internal resources, there occurred a rapid growth in debt servicing obligations commensurate with the increase in foreign assistance.
"
10030,"The obligations of the payment of foreign debts and interest exceeded the rate if gross government revenue earnings.
"
10031,"Although there were substantial increased in foreign aid commitments, due to a low disbursement ratio, there was a big increase in undisturbed amounts. At the same time, due to a system which implemented projects identified and formulated with a heavy inputs of foreign advisers and implemented in the influence of commission agents rather then influenced by the nation's needs, whatever resources were utilized could not provide direct and substantial benefit to the people and thus the system led to as increase in the burden of foreign debts.
"
10032,"As the return from the investment in the economy were not obtained in time, the foreign aid, too could not be fully utilized owing to the inability to sustain the counterpart expenditure estimated to be at 1=0.22 required for the utilization of the foreign aid during the Seventh Plan period.
"
10033,"4. Monetary and Credit situation: Money supply increased at an average annual rate of 15.6 percent during the period from June/July 1962 to June/July 1990.
"
10034,"The main factors for the increase in money supply was due to the increase in foreign assets by 14 percent and in internal borrowings by 26.1 percent.
"
10035,"During the same period, while the private sector loans increased by 21.3 percent, the government sector borrowing recorded a growth of 28.5 percent.
"
10036,"These factors limited, to a certain extent, the activities if the private sector.
"
10037,"During this period, a contraction in the money supply was caused by large increase in time deposits and the gradual growth of capital and other items.
"
10038,"One an average, the item deposits increased by 24.7 percent per annum and the incre ased in net capital and other liabilities was 35.2 percent. During this period, as shown by the review, money supply (m2) recorded an average annual growth of 17.7 percent.
"
10039,"The review also showed that while the increase in money supply in the initial years was mainly caused by foreign assets, the same in the subsequent years was caused by excessive internal borrowings.
"
10040,"The level of resources and their utilization in the commercial banks increased in an average by 22.1 percent per annum from Rs 92.9 milion in June/July 1962 to Rs 24,759.3 million in June/July 1990.
"
10041,"Among the soruces of financing for Commercial Banks, the total deposits recorded an average annual growth rate of 22.2 percent and reached Rs 21885 million from Rs 79.3 million during this period, the current savings, and 1In the conversion of Nepalese Rupee the US dollar, the conversion rate used for fiscal year 1972/73 is the average of the buying and selling rates i.e Rs 10.15=U$ and for 1989.90 Rs 19.20 = 1US dollar. fixed deposits showed and annual increase of 17.8,27.3 and 23.8 percent respectively.
"
10042,"The bank loans and investment, which were primarily confined to private sector only until June/July reaching in aggregate Rs 18,917.1 million.
"
10043,"Thus, the average annual growth in loans and investment during this period was 23.0 percent. As regards the borrowings of government sector, there occurred and annual growth of 32.2 percent from 1964/65 to 1989/90.
"
10044,"The excessive growth in government expenditure particularly during the later years of review led to a rapid increase in borrowings if the government and private sectors. The loan disbursement ration of the commercial banks which stood at 60.6 percent in June/July 1962, steadily rose to 70.1 percent in June/July 1990. joint credit extension of Agricultural Development Bank, Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and Employees Provident Fund increased to Rs 1580.1 million from Rs 241.1 million recording and increase of 13.4 percent per annum between the period 1974.75 to 1989/90.
"
10045,"Despite the insignificant success in the realization of principal in comparison to credit extension, the loan realization has increased at 16.8 percent per annum during this period.
"
10046,"While loan realization in comparison to loan disbursement was 37.2 percent in 1974/75, the overdue portion of the outstanding loan gradually increased to 58 percent in 1989/90.
"
10047,"While the unrealized loan stood at Rs 405.1 million in 1974/75, it increased to Rs 543.1 million in 1989/90 at a rate of 18.9 percent per annum.
"
10048,"Out of the total credit extension of Rs 1014 million by the commercial banks for the different uses of the private sector in 1974/75, consumable and social uses was 48 percent, trade 45.5 percent, industry 5.1 percent and agriculture and other use 1.4 percent Following the change in investment pattern, out of the total credit extension of Rs 11,798.7 million in 1989/90, the investment in industry, trade, consumable and social uses, agriculture and other uses was 32.3 percent, 28.6 percent, 23.8 percent, 13 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. The loan disbursement of the commercial banks increased at 17.8 percent per annum during this period.
"
10049,"5. Price situation:
"
10050,"During the period of the base year 1972/73 to 1989/90 the national urban consumer price index increased at an average if 9.2 percent per annum.
"
10051,"The price of food and beverages increased at 9.8 percent whereas the pricfe of non-food goods and services increased at 9.6 percent during this period. There was tremendous pressure on price due to internal and external reasons during this period.
"
10052,"Rise in oil price at the international level, worldwide price increase if development and construction materials and consumable goods, increased cost in internal production and transportation, recession in internal production were the main factors responsible for price increase.
"
10053,"Besides, there was tremendous pressure on price following an increased money supply at an average if 21 percent per annum because of the big increase in government expenditure during the seventh Plan (1989- 90) Period.
"
10054,"In addition to this, the main causes of price increase were the increased cost of goods and services produced by corporations, rice in international price of petroleum products, industrial raw materials and other goods, change in foreign exchange rate and decline in production of the non- agriculture sectors – due to trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India etc.
"
10055,"6. Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments Situation: 6.1 Foreign Trade: An analysis of the data of the past years (1962-1990) reveals that the situation of foreign trade of the country was not in a good shape.
"
10056,"Export at current price had increased at an average if 11.2 percent per annum during this period while the import had increased at 14.2percent during the same period.
"
10057,"Total trade deficit during this period had increased at an average if 16.6 percent per annum due to a limited export base in comparison to import.
"
10058,"Although considerable success was achieved in country wise diversification of trade for bringing about changes in its traditional situation, no significant achievement was made in achieving trade balance by increasing the volume of export through product-wise diversification.
"
10059,"The increase in the internal dema nd for agricultural products commensurate with the increase in population caused a decline in the surplus for export. Furthermore, the level of export development remained weak due to the low level of industrial production and the continued dependence of agricultural production on weather conditions, too.
"
10060,"The trade deficit with India increased from Rs 186.3 million in FY 1961/62 to Rs 3,979.7 million in FY 1989/90 in spite if the fact that the share if India in the total foreign trade of the country had started decreasing and the share of overseas countries had increased as a result of efforts towards diversification of trade in the past years.
"
10061,"Similarly, althouth the trade with overseas countries was worth Rs 7.1 million in FY 1961/62, the trade deficit continued to increase and reached to Rs 9186.3 in FY 1989/90 while the share of India in the total foreign tradee of Nepal was 97.7 percent during FY 1961/62 this recorded a gradual decrease to 22.7 percent only in FY1989/90.
"
10062,"During the same period, the trade with overseas countries increased to 77.3 percent from 2.3 percent. Percent.
"
10063,"Similarly, while the shares of export and import trade with India stood at 95.5 percent and 98.9 percent respectively in 1961/62, they gradually declined over the years to 12.7 percent and 25.2 percent respectively in 1980/90.
"
10064,"The trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India made 1989/90 an abnormal year, which also contributed to the trade with India drop to its lowest that year. Besides, the main reasons for the gradual decrease in trade with India in the previous years were the decline in surplus of traditionally exported agricultural products for export due to their increased internal demand and the country–wise diversification in import if daily consumer goods, construction materials and industrial raw materials from other countries following the expansion of trade with them.
"
10065,"In the context of the trade structure of the country during this period, while the foods and raw materials constituted an important place in exp ort in the initial years, the industrial finished products replaced them following their substantial reduction in the later years especially during the seventh plan period.
"
10066,"Recording a gradual increase, the shared of finished products increased to 82.9 percent of the total export in FY 1989/90. while jute and jute goods, rice, pulse and timber were main exportable in the initial years, the industrial finished products such as the woolen carpets and readymade garments became main exportable in the later years.
"
10067,"As regards the trade structure of import, the shares of foods and raw materials, industrial goods and other materials in the total import in FY 1961/62 were 39.9 percent, 59.5 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.
"
10068,"There was predominance of industrial goods in the total import in FY 1989/90.
"
10069,"The components of industrial goods and foods and industrial raw materials in the total imports in that year were 71.3 percent and 28.7 percent respectively.
"
10070,"Some efforts of export promotion and the creation of some institutional bases over the past years helped achieve some success in country-wise diversification of export trade. However, no real increase in export volume could be matherialised due to the lake of sustainable and sound bases through product diversification.
"
10071,"During the early 10 year period of the panchayat regime, there was predominance of agricultural goods such as cereals and jute in the field of export and following the gradual decline in export of these goods, the industrial goods such as woolen carpets and readymade garments occupied the prominent place in the later years.
"
10072,"Overseas import increased considerably due to the country -wise and product-wise diversification of import during this review period.
"
10073,"While the share of import was 13.1 percent in the gross Domestic product (GDP) in FY 1964/65, it gradually increased to 20.2 percent in FY 1989/90 The export, however, showed only an insignificant increase during the same period period.
"
10074,"The share of export in GDP stood at 7 percent in 1964/65, which declined to 5.7 percent only on 1989/990.
"
10075,"6.2 Balance of payments situation: The foreign trade and balance of payment situation was used to be taken in isolation till 1970.
"
10076,"Later from 1975 onwards it was felt that the foreign trade and the balance of payments situation needed to be coordinated with other aspects relation to monetary, fiscal, foreign exchange and production of the country and due attention should be paid to the close interrelations among them while formulating the economic policy.
"
10077,"National police relating to the foreign trade and balance of payments situation was formulated for the first time in the sixth plan (1980-85) to orient the foreign trade towards a specified direction in order to maintain the increased foreign trade of the country and the growth of the domestic market and to minimize the increasing trade deficit.
"
10078,"Thus, it became the foreign trade toward a specified goal of the economy during the first decade of the panchayat regime.
"
10079,"Thought the history if foreign trade of Nepal is long, the date relating to balance of payment being available only after 1974/75, the situation analysis is possible only of the years thereafter.
"
10080,"The balance of payment situation of the country was favorable for the period between 1974/75 and 1989/90 except for the three years between 1982/83 and 1984/85.
"
10081,"There were deficits of Rs 675 million, Rs 126 million and Rs866 million respectively in all these 3 years in spite of the increase in foreign aid.
"
10082,"The main reasons for the balance of payment to be unfa vourable to the country during these years were the reduction of total export and the excessive increase in import resulting in great trade deficit.
"
10083,"Current account deficit increased considerably in all three years.
"
10084,"Balance of payment surplus increased to Rs 2,649.6 million from Rs 355.2 million with an average increase of 14.3 percent per annum during the review period.
"
10085,"Trade deficit increased to rs. 13186.2 million from Rs 925 million recording an average increase of 19.4 percent during the same period.
"
10086,"While balance of payment surplus had increased by 7.5 timens in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75, trade deficit had increased by 14.3 times.
"
10087,"Similarly, current account deficit increased at 32 percent per annum or by 64.5 times in 1989/90 in comparison to 1974/75.
"
10088,"As a result, the ration of current account deficit and GDP increased intensely.
"
10089,"There occurred an excessive flow of foreign loans to bring down balance of payment deficit to a favourable situation in the years past.
"
10090,"Though this was a short term expedient to make up current account deficit amount, this was not a reliable and sound was out in the long run, as it was certain that the economy itseif will have to face serious consequences in the future due to the burden of the foreign debt loan.
"
10091,"There was a great increase in the foreign debt in the years past.
"
10092,"There was much pressure on balance of payments situation on account of increasing current account deficit each year due to a slow growth in income from services and transfers during this period. As such, income was not able to cope with the intensely increasing trade deficit.
"
10093,"While net income from services in 1974/75 was Rs 280.8 million, this increased to Rs2,613.2 million in 1989/90 with an average increase of 16 percent per annum.
"
10094,"Similarly, net income from transfers in 1974/75 was Rs 523.9 million. This increased to Rs 2,818.9 million in 1989/90 registering an average increase of 11.9 percent per annum.
"
10095,"7. Foreign Exchange Situation: The foreign exchange reserves situation was favorable on the whole during the period of July 1961 to  July 1990.
"
10096,"While there was foreign exchange reserves of Rs 206.9 million in july 1961, this increased to Rs 11,984.6 million in July 1990 with an average increase of 15 percent per annum. Out of total foreign exchange reserves, while the percentage of gold, I.M.F. tranche, ard S.D.R. was 6.8, convertible foreign exchange 35.6 in July 1961, this percentage changed to 3.5, 78.8 and 17.7 respectively in July 1990 following a gradual change in the composition.
"
10097,"While there was predominance of non-convertible foreign exchange in the total foreign exchange reserves during the initial years.
"
10098,"The reserves in convertible foreign exchange reached Rs 9441.9 million (US$ 323.4 million equivalent) in FY 1989/90 from Rs 73.7 million (Us$17.9 million equivalent) in July 1961 recording an average increase of 18.2 percent per annum in the past.
"
10099,"Similarly, the savings in non-convertible foreign exchange reached Rs 2118.1 million (US$ 72.5 million equivalent) from Rs 119.2 million (US$ 11.7 million equivalent) following an average increase of 10.4 percent per annum during this period.
"
10100,"Taking into consideration the reserves of both convertible and non-consideration currencies together, while it could meet the import for 5.8 months in FY 1960/61, it was capable of meeting 7.6 months’ import in 1989/90.
"
10101,"Thus, though there was a considerable increase in foreign currency reserves during this period, development of a regular and sustainable source of foreign exchange increased due to excessive flow if foreign loan and grants and as these are not reliable sources, a situation persisted where there was the possibility of drastic reduction of the reserves.
"
10102,"Physical progress situation:
"
10103,"1. Agriculture, Forest and Irrigation
"
10104,"1.1 Agriculture: Much importance was attached to cereal crops production programme during the periodic plans in  the past with the objective of increasing agricultural production and productivity.
"
10105,"Considering the development of institutional infrastructures during the past period and also the priority accorded in the allocation of development expenditure to meet theabove objective, the achievements made in the agricultural sector in respect of pro duction and productivity appeared to be far from satisfactory.
"
10106,"During the period of 1961/62 and 1989/90, while the are3a covered by the cereal crops increased at the rate of 2.2 percent per annum, production of principal cereal crops increased at an average of 2.1 percent per annum.
"
10107,"The productivity, thus decreased by a rate of 0.1 percent.
"
10108,"It  became clearly evident that the contribution of the increased area was pivotal to whatever increase took place in production growth.
"
10109,"Similarly, the area, the production rate and the productivity rate of cash crops increased by 1.8 percent, 5.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively over the period.
"
10110,"1.2. Forest: Massive expansion of organizational structures in the forest sector was carried out in order to conserve the forest area and arrange the supply of forest products during the past period.
"
10111,"While forest development works in the hill and terai were being undertaken through a total of 22 forest divisions and 7 circle offices in 1965, forest offices in all the 75 districts, regional offices in all the regions and more than 200 ranger offices were set up by the year 1990. similarly, the number of technical manpower was considerably increased during this period.
"
10112,"Tree plantation in 2,454 ha. of land, construction of 840 km. of forest roads and 448 km. of fire lines were carried out in F.Y 1964/65.
"
10113,"The available date reveals that the tree plantation was done in 99137 ha. of land or 40 times more in comparison to what was achieved in F.Y. 1964/65.
"
10114,"Hence, though it was claimed that massive expansion of institutional bases of the forest sector and tree plantation works was undertaken during this period, the present dilapidated situation of the forest vindicates the fact that due attention was not paid towards forest conservation, promotion and utilization.
"
10115,"Though legal frameworks were constituted for conservation, promotion and utiliisation of forest during this period, forest protection could not be undertaken in an effective manner due to weak and inefficient implementation.
"
10116,"The forest sector became the major source of personal income for the cunning and shrewd people. Forest determination took place intensively during this period.
"
10117,"This adversely affected the environment as well as the climate of the country. According to available statistics, while the forest coverage was 6,402,000 ha. in 1964, this was reduced to 6,306,000 ha. by the end of F.Y. 1985/85.
"
10118,"1.3 Irrigation: Before the advent of the panchayat system, the irrigation facility was only available to 11,428  ha. of land.
"
10119,"It was estimated that irrigation facility was available to about 21 percent of the cultivated land by 1989/90 with the availability of additional irrigation facility to a total of 539,039 ha. of land during the panchayat regime as a result of heavy investment in the irrigation sector during this period.
"
10120,"Though emphasis was given on the development and expansion of the irrigation sector in the past periodic plans, its implementation part could not be effective.
"
10121,"The economy could not derive maximum benefit from the huge investment made in the irrigation sector. The expected benefits were not forthcoming from several projects on their completion and there was lake of attention in due time towards proper repair and maintenance of completed projects.
"
10122,"2. Industry, Tourism and Electricity
"
10123,"Sector (including cottage industry) to the gross domestic product was about 5 percent and employment available to about 2 percent of the total employment available to about 2 percent of the total labour force.
"
10124,"During the period of three decades, the development of industry remained at the rudimentary stage and could not gain momentum.
"
10125,"Industrial production showed and average increase of 7 percent per annum from the analysis of the production index of 18 principal industrial products from the period 1974/75 to 1989/90. while the production of Jute goods decreased at an average of 6 percent per annum during the period, the production of agricultural tools and bricks and tiles decreased at 4.1 and 1.8 percent respectively.
"
10126,"Similarly, there took place only a slow growth in products directly associated with the needs of the society such as cement, sugar, cotton merchandise, matches, there occurred a considerable growth in consumable products like liquor, beer, synthetic cloth, soap, shoe and biscuit.
"
10127,"The capacity utilization of some selected industries was about 63 percent during the period from 1975/76 to 1989/90.
"
10128,"The capacity utilization of jute goods and beer industries was above 70 percent.
"
10129,"Similarly, the capacity utilization of sugar and cigarette industries was 69 and 66 percent respectively.
"
10130,"But the same of the cement, brick and tile and match industries remained less than 60 percent.
"
10131,"While the contribution of the cottage industry to the gross domestic produce was 1.4 pecent in  1974/75, this declined to 0.7 percent in 1989/90. the development of the cottage industry could not be oriented towards a correct direction in the past while Rs 9.6 million was invested in 1974/75 following the registration of 70 cottage and small industries, a sum of Rs 828.6 million was invested in 1989/90 with the registration of 932 cottage and small industries.
"
10132,"Hence, the pace of development of the industrial sector was slow in the past.
"
10133,"The industrial policies of the past had emphasized the creation of industrial environment to increase the contribution of the industrial sector to the economy by infusing momentum into this sector.
"
10134,"But the flow of investment could not be channeled to industries with long term benefits due to the lack of proper implementation mechanism, procedural constraints and administrative delay.
"
10135,"Due to the distortions arising out of industrial protectionism there could not be created a favourable environment for increasing the investment in nationally imoortant industries related to production, employment and income distribution.
"
10136,"The large investment of the private sector in industry was greatly attracted to the activities yielding quick and easy return.
"
10137,"There were no incentives to attract investment towards industries directly associated with the need of the society.
"
10138,"Due to this, forward and backward linkages of the economy with other sectors could not be developed.
"
10139,"The government policy instead of being incentive oriented was control oriented to attract the foreign investment.
"
10140,"On the whole, the government policy could neither act as a catalyst nor contribute in leading the country towards industrialization.
"
10141,"2. 2 Tourism While 7,750 tourists came to Nepal in F.Y. 1961/62, this number reached 246, 361 in 1989/90 with its average annual growth rate of 13.1 percent.
"
10142,"While in the beginning the Kathmandu valley alone was the centre of attraction, a substantial increase in the number of tourists took place during this period due to the extension of trekking, mountaineering, national parks and other places of touristic attraftion outside the valley.
"
10143,"Despite the increase in the number of tourists during this period, no increase in average stay and expenses incurred per day materialized for the lack of proper development and expansion of infrastructures and places of tourist attraction.
"
10144,"While the average stay of a tourist was 13.1 days in 1974/75, this went down to 12 days in 1989/90.
"
10145,"Similarly, while each tourist during his stay in Nepal spent $ 24.00 in 1961/62, the level of expenditure remained unchanged in 1989/90.
"
10146,"Substantial foreign exchange was earned from the tourist sector during the period from 1961/62 to 1989/90. while the earning from the tourist sector was merely US$ 78,000.00 in 1961/62, US$ 68,343,000,00 was earned in 1989/90 with an average increase of 26 percent per annum. 2.3 Electricity
"
10147,"Upto 1960, the total generation capacity of electric power in the country was 7.03 Mw. Out of this, 2.077 Mw.
"
10148,"Was generated from the hydropower stations and 4.953 Mw. From the diesel plants.
"
10149,"In the period between 1961/62 and 1989/90, some other small projects and big hydro-electric projects such as the panauti, Trishuli, sunkosi, Devighat, Gandak, Kulekhani and Marsyangdi were commissioned.
"
10150,"By the end of 1989/90, the total generation capacity including hydro and diesel in the country was 227.084 Mw.
"
10151,"While about 1 percent of the total population had access to electricity in 1960/61, 8.8 percent of the population could enjoy this facility by the end of 1989/90. thus, though electricity generation and distribution was increased, the burden arising from the excessive per unit cost of electricity due to completed projects being very expensive fell upon the consumers.
"
10152,"3. Transport and Communication
"
10153,"3.1 Transport
"
10154,"a. Roads Prior to 1950, the facility of motorable road in the country was almost non-existent.
"
10155,"A review of the situation shows that the road available all over the kingdom in 1960/61 was 1198 km., out of which 339km. was metalled and 859 km. fair weather road.
"
10156,"Upto the end of FY 1989/90, 7,330 km. of road facility was available in the country out of which 2,958km. was black topped, 1,658km. graveled and 2,714 km. fair weather road.
"
10157,"While looking at the road-population ratio, every kilometer of road had served a population averaging 7,780 people in 1960, upon the reduction of this ration on 1989/90, every kilometer served a population of 2441. the important highways built in the period of past thirty years are the east-west highway, Arniko highway, Siddhartha highway, Prithibi highway,  Gorkha-Narayangadh highway, Dadeldhura-dipayal-Doti highway, Dharan-Khankuta highway,
"
10158,"In addition to these, some efforts have also been made in the construction of suspension bridge, wooden bridges, foot trail, mule track and service tra ck etc. which constrtute the minimum basic needs for the development of the rural areas.
"
10159,"Thus, in spite of the efforts mad for the development of road transport, several of the district headquarters od not have access to road. The construction of roads co uld not be completed as required nor could the economy derive maximum benefits from the constructed roads because of the excessive increase in the cost of road construction and the lack of timely repair and maintenance.
"
10160,"b. Air Transport Prior to 1960AD, the country had a total of 12 airfields with 1 metalled and 11 fair weather type.
"
10161,"Necessary physical facilities and communication services complementary to aviation were unavailable in several air-fields.
"
10162,"In FY 1974/75 there was a total of 28 air fields, all over the kingdom with 4 metalled, 12 fair eather and 12 small airstrips.
"
10163,"By 1989/90 the number of total air fields reached 43. the internal air service has been operated by Royal Nepal Airlines corporation.
"
10164,"In 1960/61, this corporation had initiated its service with 6 aeroplanes.
"
10165,"In FY 1989/90, this corporation had 24 aeroplanes and it operated its services internally is 36 places and externally in 10 cities. Long before 1960, railways and ropeways were established in Nepal.
"
10166,"Till FY 1960/61 Nepal had 99 km. of narrow gauge railway and 23km. long ropeway linking Hetauda and Kathmandu with a capacity to carry 25 Tons of material per hour was constructed and service of trolley bus between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur covering a distance of 13 km. was brought into operation.
"
10167,"Thus, no specific progress was achieved in the development of other types of transport during this period.
"
10168,"As far as the railway transport is concerned, the progress was absolutely nil.
"
10169,"3.2 Communication
"
10170,"a. Postal Services Till FY 1960/61, the total number of post offices all over the country was 409. it was estimated that a post office at an average had provided service to 22,252 people within an area of 132 square miles.
"
10171,"In FY 1974/75, the country had 1,006 post offices.
"
10172,"Out of these, there were one general post office, 74 district post offices, 254 sub-post offices and 678 additional post offices.
"
10173,"In FY 1989/90, Nepal had a total of 2,231 post offices.
"
10174,"Thus in 1989/90 each post office provided service to 8100 people within an area of 66 sq.km.
"
10175,"b. 	Telecommunication Service Regarding telecommunication sector, service of 1,120 telephone lines was available through the local telephone exchanges in FY 1960.1961, which meant one line served every 8, 303 people.
"
10176,"Population-telephone ratio in Nepal reached 250:1 with the availability of the service of 71,560 telephone lines in FY 1989/90. as regards international telecommunication, I.S.D.
"
10177,"Service was made available to keep contact with several countries of the world.
"
10178,"c. 	Radio Broadcasting , Television Transmission and Periodicals Radio Nepal has been able to reach 90 percent of the population through medium was transmission by 1989/90 similarly, many other dailies, weeklies and monthlies has been published from the private sector for the general publicity work.
"
10179,"In reality, the people could rarely get true and real messages through the newspaper etc. in spite of the fact that freedom to newspapers etc. plan with the motto of National communication Plan with the motto of “Communication for dev elopment” was launched in 1971.
"
10180,"The communication sector was in fact stagnated as the media of communication were within the government control. The Nepal Television has started operation its service since 1985.
"
10181,"4. Social Services
"
10182,"The country made some progress in the field of education in the past. But that progress was merely limited to quantitative increase.
"
10183,"While teacher-student ration was 1:25 at the primary class (class 1- 3) level in 1961, it increased to 1:39 by April 1990.
"
10184,"Similarly, the school-student ration of 1:46 in  1961, recorded a significant increase to 1:156 by April 1990.
"
10185,"Hence, a situation arose, where sufficient number of schools could not be increased in comparison to the increase in the number of students.
"
10186,"Out of the total students of the primary class of the age group 6 to 10, 182,533 had attended their classes in 1961 and this work out to be 14.4 percent of that age group.
"
10187,"Against this, 2,789,000 students attended classes by April 1990 and this works out to be 80 percent of that age group.
"
10188,"While the number of lower secondary schools was 677 in 1972, this number reached 3964 by April 1990. similarly, the school-student ration decreased from 1:201 to 1:187 and the teacher-student ration reached 1:28 from 1:26 following the increase in the number of student from 136,010 to 344,138.
"
10189,"Similarly, at the secondary school level, the number of schools increased from 156 in 1961 to 1959 in April 1990, the number of teachers from 1,772 to 10,421 and the number of students from 26,845 to 264,525.
"
10190,"Hence, the school-student ration of 1961 increased from 1:172 to 1:187 by April 1990 and similarly, the teacher-student ration changed from 1:15 to 1:35.
"
10191,"In the field of higher education, while the number of students in 1961 was 5,143, this increased to 102,130 in FY 1989/90.
"
10192,"Development requirements of the country could not be met in spite of this quantitiative increase in the educational sector.
"
10193,"The National Education plan (1971-75) was announced on April 16, 1971 claiming that the education system prior to the advent of the panchayat system was not in keeping with the country, time and the Nepalese society.
"
10194,"It was believed that the system would be instrumental to fulfil the national objective of education towards preparation of neces sary manpower for economic development with the dissemination of requisite knowledge, science, development, conservation and promotion of technical expertise and skill.
"
10195,"In the process if implementing this system, the budget was increased 5 to 6 times in the districts where the education plan had been introduced; the schools run with the public participation were brought under the government employees on the name of making the teaching profession attractive, a ten- month mandatory field work under the national Development service porgramme was introduced; sixteen institutes and campuses were established by bringing about fundamental changes in the administrative set up of teaching institutions providing higher education.
"
10196,"The country could not make qualitative advance in the field of education as a result of the new education system; instead, there was further deteoriation.
"
10197,"No academic changes evolved in the attitudinal perspective of the students an teachers, unsustainable financial burden increased on the educational sector and public participation was almost obliterated.
"
10198,"Useful programmes such as the National Development service programmes were put off for political reasons.
"
10199,"The situation of educational environment began to deteoriate further and education was taken as a medium to gain knowledge and skill.
"
10200,"The National Education was proved to be ineffective and inappropriate on account of all these reasons.
"
10201,"To look into the development of health services, while there were 39 hospitals, 1019 hospit al beds,  55 health posts, 93 health centres and 63 ayurvedic dispensaries in the3 field of curative services in Nepal in 1961, the number of hospitals, hospital beds, health posts and health centres increased to 111, 4570, 816 and 18 respectively in 1990. while population per hospital bed was 9,146 in 1961, this was 3915 in 1990.
"
10202,"Thus, each doctor had to provide service to 14,958 people in 1990. while the average life span of a Nepali citizen was 28 years in 1961, this increased to 53 by FY 1989/90.
"
10203,"Family planning programme was launched as a national programme only from FY 1965/66 through the government and non -government associations and institutions while maternity child health programe was initiated around FY 1973/74 only.
"
10204,"Afterwares, family planning and maternity child health projects were implemented in all the 75 districts if the kingdom.
"
10205,"4.3 Drinking water Attention was given towards providing drinking water facility right from the beginning of planned development.
"
10206,"Drinking water programmes had been initiated especially in urban areas and some rural areas prior to 1960.
"
10207,"By 1961 1,452,000 gallons of water per day was available to 6 percent of the population.
"
10208,"In 1989/90, only 36 percent of the total population had drinking water facility with 67 percent and 33 percent of the urban and rural areas respectively having access to this facility.
"
10209,"Accordingly, the available statistics shows that 5,424, 000 and 1,134,000 residents of the rural and  urban areas respectively had access to the drinking water facility.
"
10210,"Thus, majority of the people in the country are as yet deprived from an access to hygienic supply of water in spite of the fact that expansion of drinking water facility had taken place in the past.
"
10211,"The water that was provided was also not available in required quantities.
"
10212,"On the one hand, there was a lack of hygienic supply of water, and on the other, there was plenty of leakage in the drinking water.
"
10213,"In addition to this, it is estimated that 70 percent of the diseases are caused by the polluted water.
"
10214,"Conclusions: Viewed in the total perspective, in spite of massive investments made in the past, Nepal still remains one of the  poorest nations of the world.
"
10215,"Although some progress was made in social and physical infrastructural sectors, the progres s appeared remarkable only in comparison to the negligible figures of the base year.
"
10216,"The lack of structural change in production hindered the development process from gaining momentum.
"
10217,"A low savings rate, the increased share of loan in forging assistance, low level of industrialization, weak agricultural production, limited export trade and a high population growth rate remained as barriers in the path of development.
"
10218,"They economy had to face serious problems due to imbalance between resource mobilisation and expenditure, imbalance between savings and investments and between export and import and the lack of control over population growth.
"
10219,"During the three decades of the panchayat regime, there was never a dearth of attractive fundamental reform programmes and slogans.
"
10220,"However, these programmes were confined to mere slogans due to the lack of political commitment.
"
10221,"Some of the functions whose initiation was attempted at conceptual and operational levels by the elected demarcation government in 1959 for fundamental changes in economic structure were given political colour and introduced as fundamental economic reform movements.
"
10222,"Notwithstanding the fact that without people’s faith and commitment no planned development can manifest into meaningful reality and nor can any sustainable change oriented to people’s welfare be brought about in the economic structure, a revolutionary economic programme of land reform was introduced in the very beginning of the panchayat regime.
"
10223,"Land reform was, in fact, an essential programme in a feudalistic rural society, but the inability to prepare accurate land records, lack of the guarantee of tenancy right, the existence of dual or multi ownership of land, inability to provide land for shelter and subsistence income, failure to keep prcords and make proper utilization of the collected savings, lack of diversification in crop farming and cottage industries in the rural sector and, above al, the lack of desirable growth in production and productivity during the thirty years if the panchayat regime have clearly evidenced the failure if lad reform.
"
10224,"Instead, as a long-term consequence, there emerged a situation after land reform where Nepal, a major food exporter of south Asia, turned into an importer of food grains and the situation accelerated the process if migration, too.
"
10225,"A national campaign entitled ‘Back to the Village’ was initiated with a view to providing a village -oriented philosophical base to the panchayat regime. It was indeed a prerequisite for rural development.
"
10226,"However, while it was predestined that there would be no going ‘back to the village’ without the decentralization of power, the construction of infrastructure for rural development and the creation of employment opportunities, this genuine movement instead if being utilized in development programmes was developed into a system of political evaluation of panchayat workers and a means of orienting them towards position of pow3er.
"
10227,"This movement experienced a misfortune when it turned into a process of the selection of workers, replacing the election system, masquerading as unanimity.
"
10228,"The people were despaired of their aspirations, enthusiasm and zeal to participate in development efforts by this process, which thus created a set-back to local development.
"
10229,"It was, indeed, not at all inappropriate on a conceptual le vel to create a basis for balanced regional development through the formation of development regions based on a realistic delineation of a north-south growth axis or development corridors.
"
10230,"However, no efforts were made towards developing a systematic settlement of the population along the growth or development corridors in desirable proportions and there were not launched, as required, any socio-economic programmes based on available local means and resources and focusing on the generation of employment opportunities either.
"
10231,"Consequently, a system developed in which the center controlled the mechanism of regional development, which accorded a decisive role to the central Development Region creating an influx of a large population to it and making it the operation-site for the greatest number of development programmes. The construction of the East-west highway which was initiated in the panchayat regime was a multidimensional project for national development.
"
10232,"However, the construction of this highways designed to link the remote,    inaccessible Far western Region could not be completed even within the stretch of thirty years. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that whatever sectors were completed, did contribute to linking the socio-economic activities of the road corridors to the market-oriented economy.
"
10233,"Moreover, since the immediate as well as long-term effects of a project of such a great magnitude were not take into full consideration, the Terai region has now had to bear the brunt of the natural as well as ma n-made disasters like drought and floods due to excessive migration, haphazard human settlements and the degradation of the churiya region and the charkoshe Jhari (the forest belt of the Terai), once acclaimed as the treasure house of forest resources.
"
10234,"The rehabilitation of the environment in terms of the magnitude of degradation that has occurred has become a momentous task for a century. Enlisting panchayat as a third sector in the periodic plans of the panchayat regime, statistical projections were made with regard to people’s labours contribution.
"
10235,"Thus, the essential and effective prerequisites for national development, people’s participation and people’s labour contribution, could not be utilized for sustainable development orientated to people’s welfare.
"
10236,"During the panchayat regime, programmes were implemented with greater emphasis on the task of preserving the system than on national development.
"
10237,"A new education plan was introduced in the form of a national education system, which in reality created a havoc in the education sector.
"
10238,"Education experienced a qualitative deterioration, the government had to bear the brunt of almost an unsustainable burden of expenditure, and the public participation in education recorded s a steady decline.
"
10239,"Many commissions were constituted and studies conducted on the issue of the decentralization of power.
"
10240,"The  fact that efficient, autonomous local bodies are the corner-stone of a democratic system and can, uphold the responsibility of local development through people’s participation was ignored.
"
10241,"With a view to projecting Panchayat as a democration system, some efforts were made with regard to decentralization but there occurred centralization with several instances of retrieval of the decentralized authority.
"
10242,"In the first place, the power entrusted to local bodies were not of permanent nature as the bodies themselves were liable to be dismissed at any time at the discretion of the government.
"
10243,"Wile for the lack of decentralization in real terms, many projects aimed at integrated rural development with international assistance could not deliver meaningful results, many projects, as the studies have revealed, created a negative outlook towards development at the local level.
"
10244,"A programme to control the increasing population was indeed indispensable.
"
10245,"A population policy was formulated for this purpose.
"
10246,"It included some basic activities such as the reduction of birth rate, control of immigration, control of migration from hills to the Terai and from villages to urban areas and maternal child health care.
"
10247,"However, while the immigration problem remained unchanged due to the inability to restore cordial relations with the neighbouring country with an open border and the failure to recognize the problem in an international perspective, the other aspects of population control ended in failure for the lack of complementary programmes.
"
10248,"In consequence, there arose impediments to urban development, the social service infrastructures became insufficient, unemployment increased, the environment deteriorated, pollution prevailed and in the long run, the adverse impact in the economy as a whole was evidently perceptible to all.
"
10249,"Although in the three periodic plans of the panchayat regime preference was accorded to agricultural sector for intensification and diversification in crops through reforms in the farming system of this country composed of hamlets and villages, the wide gulf between planning and implementation always led to a negative result.
"
10250,"While it called for liberal economic policies and the creation of an atmosphere conducive to industrialists with some reassurances in certain spheres for achieving industrial expansion, the industries could not prosper in the absence of transparency in industrial policy which remained under strict government control.
"
10251,"Even those industries which had begun their operation could not flourish for not being able to acquire self reliance.
"
10252,"The ‘basic needs’ programme announced in Dec./Jan/ 1985 became the principal slogan and priority of the Seventh plan.
"
10253,"This programme took a vow to fulfil the basic minimum needs such as foodgrains, clothing, housing, health, education and public security among others and raise the economic condition of the people to the Asian standard by 2000.
"
10254,"Because of the dynamic nature of the Asian standard, the term was eventually deleted from the slogan.
"
10255,"The basic needs programme had adopted a supply oriented approach in its formulation paying no attention to the purchasing power of the proposed consumers.
"
10256,"Without any resource mobilisation for physical and institutional development, production targets, unthinkable in a historical perspective, were set for the fulfillment of the needs.
"
10257,"In consequence of the distorted ad hoc economic policies of thirty years interspersed with hollow slogans of disappointing development resumts and programmes without achievements, the country had to bear several economic distortions which were as follows.
"
10258,"Excessive Control and Regulation: The control-oriented development approach of the past created many problems.
"
10259,"Increased government control, adhoc regulations and procedures, license requirements and other forms of counterproductive bureaucratic behaviour tended to discourage decision making process and delays in the disbursement of budgets increased project implementation costs and resulted in the under utilization of the administrative capacity.
"
10260,"The performance of state owned enterprises reached a stage of great inefficiency, indifference and apathy. The financial liabilities of these enterprises exceeded the capacity if the government.
"
10261,"These enterprises suffered as a result of over staffing, political intervention, inefficiency and the lack of accountability.
"
10262,"Cost-benefit rations, and other criteria criteria which measure the economic and social benefits of projects were neglected in the coruse of selecting projects to be implemented in various sectors and sub-sectors. The interrelationships among projects and alternative investment options were not takes into consideration.
"
10263,"As a result, investment could not be channeled to productive sectors. Many projects were not justifiable from economic and social points of vies.
"
10264,"High cost Economy: In view of the inaccessibility and the ruggedness of terrain it is not unusual for the production and delivery costs to be high.
"
10265,"But in addition to these realities, the cost component of the economy has been further aggravated by the dominance of donor driven projects, economically unproductive investments, lack of discipline, limited economic resources of projects, unwarranted expansion of bureaucracy and lack of efficient implementation capabilities.
"
10266,"Inefficient Administration: Inefficiency in the administration has led to a further deterioration in the government’s institutional abilities to effectively implement development programmes.
"
10267,"Faulty Planning Process:
"
10268,"The planning process remained very weak and was poorly institutionalized.
"
10269,"As it was incumbent upon the interim gov ernment to fulfil these two functions within a short period on a priority basis, the task of formulating a periodic plan was postponed for the time being.
"
10270,"Subsequent to the formation of the imterim government, an understanding with India in May 1990 ended the trade impasse with India which had begun on March 23, 1989, reinstating the status quo ante in relationship with India.
"
10271,"This understanding with India had a positive impact the year on the country’s economic activities.
"
10272,"The government established a citizen’s investment fund, introduced wealth tax and made efforts to redue the budgetary deficit.
"
10273,"Similarly, policies were adopted to increase the role of the private sector in agriculture and to offer additional incentives to low-income farming families in the course of providing loans.
"
10274,"Following the formation of the Nepali congress government with a clean mandate in the general elections held in May 1991, the National Planning Commission in the course of formulation the Eighth plan brought out for circulation and approach paper of the plan.
"
10275,"The government formed through general elections started taking some major steps to remove the distortions in the country’s economic and administrative structure.
"
10276,"Initially, the present government took steps to transform the controlled economy of the past thirty years into an open, liberal, transparent and competive market oriented economy.
"
10277,"In order to expand the participation of private sector in economic activities, new monetary, fiscal, industrial and commercial sectors were introduced.
"
10278,"Similarly, with the objective of achieving full convertibility if the Nepalese currency in current account, a partial convertibility system was introduced.
"
10279,"A policy was adopted to abolish licensing for the establishment of industries except for those related to defence, public health and environment and to operate a one window system for providing facilities to the industries.
"
10280,"In view if huge losses being incurred by public enterprises, a process was initiated to privatize three government owned industrial enterprises.
"
10281,"Necessary procedures have also been initiated to privatize five agricultural farms in government sector.
"
10282,"With a view to strengthening the internal air service, permission was granted to private sector to operate domestic flights. As a result, three private sector airlines have begun their domestic flight operation within one year.
"
10283,"Liberal policies aimed at attracting more tourists have also been adopted to encourage the services of foreign airlines. With the objectives of attracting foreign investors, a new foreign investment policy was formulated.
"
10284,"According to these new rules, project chiefs are authorized to senction estimated expenditures if upto 5 million rupees, to approve tenders of upto 20 million rupees and to modify upto 10 percent of total expenditure on technical grounds.
"
10285,"Programmes were also initiated to privatize inefficient public enterprises for promoting their efficiency in keeping with efficient commercial principles, to reduce unproductive investment and to list 316 ongoing projects for implementation at the National Planning commission level. The listing if these projects would be done upon reviewing them for justification of their implementation from an economic point of view and from their compatibility with the environment and to make the planning process more efficient and effective.
"
10286,"Direct involvement in keeping with the policy of decentralization.
"
10287,"Accordingly, the District Development Committee Act 1992, the municipality Act 1992 and the Village Development Committee Act, 1992 have been formulated and implemented.
"
10288,"Under this arrangement, the banks conducting business in foreign currency were allowed to sell 65 percent of their earnings from trade or services at the open market exchange rate by making available 35 percent of the foreign currency earning to Nepal Rastra Bank at a rate fixed by the bank.
"
10289,"During the same period, the agreement reached with India on trade, transit and the control of unauthorized trade removed the feeling of instability prevalent in the trade sector.
"
10290,"The new agreement incorporates significant provisions such as mutual understanding to be reached on the issue of the exemption of Indian tax on the export of primary goods from Nepal, the reduction of the mandatory constituent percentage of indigenous raw materials from 80 percent to 65 percent in the manufactured products of Nepal, the reduction of internal value added from 50 percent to 40 percent and so on.
"
10291,"With the objective of providing direct benefits to the low income people, a policy was adopted granting one third interest subside on the current interest rates in a lloan of upto Rs 10,000 under the small farmers Development project, Intensive Banking programme, and Rural women Development programme.
"
10292,"Similarly, another policy allowed a 80 percent interest waiver at prevalent rates of interest to the economically deprived sections in the rural area for income generating employment activities on a loan of upto Rs 2,500 procured for the spinning wheel and wool for carpet industry, handichafts, small-scale mills, small farming enterprises etc.
"
10293,"As a part of the alternative energy development programme, rural electrification was initiated.
"
10294,"A provision to offer a capital of Rs 7,000 was made to make the bio-gas plants accessible to rural families.
"
10295,"These steps will make important contribution in alleviating poverty in rural areas.
"
10296,"In order to effectively and appropriately implement the above mentioned policies, it is necessary to increase the work-efficiency of the government administrative machinery and to achieve the active participation of the private sector.
"
10297,"The government has accordingly constituted a high level Administration Reform commission and a process has been initiated for the implementation of the commission’s recommendations’.
"
10298,"Similarly, a commission was formed to undertake a detailed study of the civil servants’ pay scales and make necessary recommendations in order to raise the moral of the civil servants and increase their work-performance.
"
10299,"1. Gross Domestic Product:
"
10300,"Similarly, according to a preliminary estimate, the per capita GDP is expected to increase only by 1 percent in 1991/92.
"
10301,"Therefore, the per capita income has increased marginally and estimated to have reached Rs 1754. only a marginal increase in per capita income in 1991/92 can be mainly attributed to the decline in agriculture production.
"
10302,"In the period of 1989/90-1991/92, the gross domestic product went up by 4.3 percent with the growth of 1.6 percent in agricultural sector and 8.4 percent in non-agricultural sector.
"
10303,"As long as the economy is dominated by factors like weather, the agricultural production will certainly not be able to achieve the desired growth.
"
10304,"In the fiscal year F.Y. 1990/91 (at F.Y. 1974.75 constant prices), the shares of an agricultural and non- agricultural sectors in gross domestic product were respectively 59.4 percent and 42.1 percent, which are expected to be 57.9 percent and 42.1 percent respectively in F.Y. 1991/92.
"
10305,"Thus, over the past few years, while the share of the agricultural sector has shown a gradual decline, the non-agricultural sector’s share has recorded a steady growth.
"
10306,"The main contributing factors for theis can be attributed to the various efforts of the government for the development of the non-agricultural sectors.
"
10307,"During the F.Y. 1989/90-1991/92 period, the major crops recorded an increase of 0.1 percent wit h a decline of 0.7 percent in the production indices of major food crops and a 3.6 percent increase in cash crops.
"
10308,"In that period, while the production of most of the crops increased, paddy, oil seeds and tobacco recorded a slight decrease.
"
10309,"The production indices of major industrial products are estimated to have gone up by 22.2 percent in 1989/90-1991/92 period. According to the new classification of industrial products, it is estimated that the production of food products, beverages, textile, tobacco products, shoes, plastic goods, the products of iron and steel based industries have increased during the period under review.
"
10310,"Further acceleration in industrial production is expected as a result of the new industrial policy. 2. Investment and savings:
"
10311,"In fiscal year 1990/91, gross investment is estimated to have increased at a rate of approximately 28.4 percent to Rs 21,163 million, which stands at 20.1 percent of gross domestic product.
"
10312,"It is estimated that the total consumption in fiscal year 1990/91 increased by 15.4 percent amounting to Rs 94,836 millions. Thus, investme nt-savings ration declined from 33.7 percent in 1989/90 to 32.4 percent  in that fiscal year.
"
10313,"3. Government Financial Situation:
"
10314,"3.1 	Development Expenditure:
"
10315,"According to revised estimates, while the government revenue will go up by 17.2 percent at current prices and 1.7 percent at constant prices, the non-tax revenue is expected to increase by 28.4 percent at current prices and 11.5 percent at constant prices.
"
10316,"If the revenue grows at this rate, the total revenue will reach 10.2 percent at current prices and 6.2 percent at constant prices of the gross domestic product.
"
10317,"Similarly, it is estimated that the tax-revenue will be 7.7 percent at constant prices, and the non- tax revenue will be 2.5 and 1.6 percent of GDP respectively. The indirect taxes are thus estimated to continue their predominance in the tax revenue structure.
"
10318,"During this period, regular expenditure will, according to the estimate, grow by 20.1 percent at current prices and 4.3 percent at constant prices.
"
10319,"Viewed in terms of the share in gross domestic product, the regular expenditure in 1990/91 and 1991/92 stands respectively at 7.2 and 7.4 percent at current prices and 4.4 and 4.5 percent at constant prices.
"
10320,"Patiently shouldering the newly elected government made all possible efforts to control the regular expenditure.
"
10321,"Despite the continued efforts to increase revenue and control regular expenditure, there was no marked increade in the revenue surplus because of a low collection of taxes particularly in 1990.91 and the pressure of the increased salary of civil servants on regular expenditure especially in the latter months of 1991/92.
"
10322,"The share of revenue surplus on gross domestic product remained at current prices at 3.0 percent in 1990/91 and 2.8 percent in 1991/92.
"
10323,"At constant prices the figures thus stood at 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent respectively.
"
10324,"b. Deficit Finance: During the period under review, as the targeted growth in revenue was not achieved, concerted efforts were made towards controlling the mobilisation of deficit finance in the economy and remarkable progress was made in this regard.
"
10325,"The shard of deficit fincance is expected, especially in 1990/91, to be 1.0 percent at current prices and 0.6 percent of GDP at constant prices, and thus the share of the same in internal resource mobilisation is estimated to be only 22.1 percent.
"
10326,"As a result of the steps taken by the government towards eliminating the level of disparity between foreign aid commitments and their utilization, the committed foreign aid during 1990.91 is expected to have been fully utilized nearly to the extent of hundred percent.
"
10327,"The utilized amount appears to have exceeded the aid commitments because of the inclusion of unused amount of previous years.
"
10328,"In view of the heavy reliance on foreign assistance in the past, it was not possible to drastically reduce this dependence.
"
10329,"Furthermore, as various projects at different stages of implementation are being funded by foreign aid and as their closure would not only entail a wastage of foreign aid in development expenditure and the share of loan in total foreign aid are estimated to be more or less equivalent to those in 1989/90.
"
10330,"4. Monetary and credit situation: the principal objective of the monetary policy of the period under revied was to regulate the rate of money supply at a level sustainable at the actual growth rate of national production and the national economy, to strengthen the financial base by introducing reforms in the financial sector, to make the  bank interest rates more realistic by enhancing the efficacy of indirect monetary control measures and  the economically deprived people and in the priority sectors.
"
10331,"The money supply level increased at the rate of 17.6 percent from mid July 1989 to mid July 1991, as a result of which the money supply level which stood at Rs 11,775.4 million in mid july 1989 reached rs. 16,283.6 million in mid July 1991.
"
10332,"During that period, the currency increased by 21.2 percent ad the current deposit by 9.9 percent.
"
10333,"This high growth rate of money supply was caused by both internal and external factors. The net forging assets increased form Rs 6203.5 million in mid July 1989 to Rs 16,150.7 million in mid July 1991. the domestic credit went up by 130.9 percent during that period.
"
10334,"The commercial banks, it is noticed, directed their loans and investment towards the government sector during this period.
"
10335,"Out of the total loan and investment disbursement of Rs 18,917 million form commercial banks in mid July 1990, loan totaling Rs 3582.5 Million was disbursed to the government sector.
"
10336,"Similarly, by mid July 1991, thee government sector had received Rs, 7,373.1 million out of the total bank credit and investment disbursement of Rs 24,410.5 millions.
"
10337,"However, the public sector undertakings appeared to have received less bank credit disbursement in mid july 1991. n the other hand, loands to the private sector gradually increased.
"
10338,"The level of credit extension to the private sector, which stood at Rs 12,733 million in 1990. reached Rs 15026.8 million in 1991.
"
10339,"5. Price situation: During the period 1989/90 and 19991/92, the urban consumer price index went up by 15.2 percent experiencing a growth prate of 16.8 percent in food and beverage products and 12.1 percent in non-food product and services.
"
10340,"The major reason behind the 15.2 percent and service. The major reason behind the 15.2 percent growth was the increase in overall index by 20.8 percent in 1991/92. the immense growth in non-food products and services accompanied by the increas e in food and beverage products in 1991/92 caused the price level reach extremely high during this period.
"
10341,"However, both internal and external factors were responsible for this high price rise.
"
10342,"At the internal front, the major factors were the reduction in the production of food crops because of adverse weather conditions, the devaluation of the Nepalese currency in comparison to convertible foreign currencies leading to the increase in pricen of raw materials and foreign goods imported from third countries, the immense price rise in Indian imports owing to the decline in the production of food ad other products as a consequence of adverse weather conditions and the excessive liquidity in the economy.
"
10343,"Similarly, the external factors consisted of the increas e in the rates of foreign exchange and the inflation in Indian market etc.
"
10344,"6. Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments Situation: 6.1 	Foreign Trade: As a result of the trade impasse with India, the share of the trade with India in total foreign trade was  only 22.7 percent in 1989/90, which increased to 28.5 percent in 1991/92 following the improvement in Nepal-India relations subsequent to the people’s movement of 1990.
"
10345,"Out of the total export, the export to India was Rs 1,701.2 million in 1990/91 and reached to Rs 1,568.9 million in 1991/92.
"
10346,"On the import front, the fiscal year 1990/91 recorded the total import of Rs 24,197.9 million, which reached Rs 32,951.3 million in fiscal year 1991/92.
"
10347,"The import from India which stood at Rs 7,772.4 million in 1990/91 increased to Rs 11,815.9 million in 1991/92. similarly, imports from other countries increased to Rs 21,135.4 million in 1991/92 from Rs 16,425.5 millions in 1990/91.
"
10348,"Thus, the total trade deficit, which was Rs 16,594.2 million in 1990/91, increased to Rs 19,011.9 million in 1991/92.
"
10349,"In 1990/91, while the trad deficit with India was Rs 6,071.2 million, with other countries ot stood at Rs 10,523 million.
"
10350,"Similarly, the deficit with India and other countries in 1991/92 stood at Rs 10,247 million and Rs 8,764.9 million respectively.
"
10351,"Thus, the trade deficit which increased by 26.0 percent in 1990/92 declined to 14.6 percent in 1991/92.
"
10352,"In view of the trade composition of the country, the industrial goods have, in comparison with food products and raw materials, started gaining dominant share in the country’s export.
"
10353,"The share of food products and raw materials in the total export was 21.9 percent in fiscal year 1990/91 and 19.4 percent in fiscal year 1991/92. similarly, which the share of industrial goods in total export stood at 78.1 percent in fiscal year 1990/91, it increased to 80.6 in fiscal year 1991/92.
"
10354,"The increased predominance of the industrial goods in the import trade composition in fiscal year  1990/91 continued to the subsequent year of 1991/92, too.
"
10355,"The share of food products and raw materials in total import was 30.9 percent in F.Y. 1990/91, which increased slightly to 3.6 perc ent in F.Y 1991/92.
"
10356,"Thus, the share of industrial goods slightly declined from 69.1 percent in F.Y. 1990/91 to 63.4 percent on F.Y. 1991/92. 6.2 	Balance of payments situation:
"
10357,"Although the balance of payments situation appeared favourable during F.Y. 1990/91, the current account deficit was noticed to have increased considerably.
"
10358,"While the current account had increased to Rs 10,254.9 million in F.Y. 1990/91, it reduced to Rs 9,578.1 in F.Y. 1991/92.
"
10359,"The principal reason behind the fall in current account deficit was the slackness experienced in the increase of trade deficit.
"
10360,"During these years also, foreign grants and loans played a major role in maintaining a favourable balance of payments situation.
"
10361,"Yet, compared to historical growth rate (1974/75-1989/90), it is on the decline.
"
10362,"For instance, while the trade deficit increased by 19.4 percent as current account by 32.0 percent in 1974/75–1989/90, they recorded average annual growth rates of 14.5 percent and 11.5 percent respectively during the period 1989/90-1991/92.
"
10363,"As compared to the trade deficit of Rs 16,907.6 million in 1990/91, it has reached Rs 17,302.5 million in he first eleven months of 1991/92.
"
10364,"Although, there occurred a slight growth in service income (net) and transfer income (net), the rate growth was unable to meet the increase in trade deficit ad, consequently, the current account deficit has increased during these years.
"
10365,"While in 1990/91 the balance of payment surplus was Rs 4,781.2 million, the surplus reached Rs 4,306.6 million in the first eleven months of 1991/92.
"
10366,"Thus, as a result of the increased flow of external loans and capital and capital and miscellaneous capital (net), there has been an increase in the balance of payments surplus this year also in spite of the considerable increase in trade deficit and current account deficit.
"
10367,"7. Foreign Exchange situation: The policy of partial convertibility in foreign exchange was adopted since 4th march 1992.
"
10368,"Following its introduction, the commercial banks have begun foreign exchange transactions at open market exchange rate for payments to these sectors. The foreign exchange reserve which stood at an amount equivalent to Rs 11,984.6 million in mid July, 1990, increased to Rs 19,270 million in mid July, 1991. thus, while the foreign exchange reserve in mid July, 1990, was Just sufficient to cover 7.6 months of imports, the reserve grew sufficiently to cover 9.9 months of imports by mid July 1991.
"
10369,"Physical progress situation:
"
10370,"1. Agriculture, Forest and Irrigation
"
10371,"1.1 	Agriculture:
"
10372,"During the same period the productivity of food crops declined by 1.5 percent. Major cash crops increased during the same period by 9.9 percent in production and 1.5 percent in area.
"
10373,"The rate of productivity went up by 7.9 percent. As regards the sale and distribution of production inputs in F.Y. 1990/91, 72,719 metric tons of chemical fertilizers and 2,325 metric tons of seeds were sold.
"
10374,"At the same time, agricultural credit disbursed during that period amounted to Rs 1095.3 million. It is estimated that 86.000 m. tons of chemical fertilizers and 2210 m. tons of improved seeds were sold in F.Y.
"
10375,"1991.92. similarly, agricultural credit to the tune of Rs 1,220.2 million is expected to have been made available.
"
10376,"1.3 	Irrigation: While the irrigation facility was available to additional 20,810 hectares only in 1990/91, it is estimated to have been extended to an additional area of 27,527 hectares.
"
10377,"2. Industry, Tourism and Electricity:
"
10378,"2. 1 	Industry:
"
10379,"The industrial production index increased by 29 percent (1986/87=100) in the fiscal year 1990/91. the main reason behind the higher growth in industrial production that year can be attributed to the convenient supply of industrial raw materials following the end of the trade and transit impasse between Nepal and India in May 1990.
"
10380,"In that fiscal year the capacity utilization in sugar, cement, brick and tiles and jute sect ors recorded an increase.
"
10381,"The industrial production is estimated to have risen by 15.7 percent in F.Y. 1991/92. it is estimated that is this year there has been an increase in the production of animal feed, cotton cloth, jute goods, powder soap, cement, beer, battery, plastic and jute items.
"
10382,"During these years, the share of small and cottage industries in gross domestic product remained around 1 percent.
"
10383,"While there was an investment of about Rs 1,723.4 million in cottage and small industries registered within the first nine months of F.Y. 1990/91, it was estimated the in F.Y. 1991/92 there would be an investment of about Rs 1,801.4 millions on 4708 industries registering within the first nine months.
"
10384,"2.2 	Tourism: New trekking routes were opened in mustang and Manang regions in the two 1990/91 and 1991/92 fiscal years.
"
10385,"Permission was granted within this period to three private companied to operate air services and to one to operate companies to operate air services and to one to operate helicopter service.
"
10386,"In respect of the extension of airport facilities, the installation of terminal tower equipment was completed in Tribhuvan International Airport and at Nepalgunj, Dhangarhi, Surkhet, Simra and Rumjatar air fields.
"
10387,"The number of foreign tourist arrival which stood at 279,747 in F.Y. 1990/91 increased by 7.8 percent to 301, 496 in F.Y. 1991/92. while the foreign currency earning in 1990/91 was equivalent to US dollar 56.9 millions, it reached US dollar 62.1 million, going up by 9 percent in 1991/92.
"
10388,"By the end of 1990/91, a total of 231.873 megawatts of hydropower was generated, which is 0.279 percent of the nation’s hydro power potential.
"
10389,"The total hydropower generation by 1991.92, reached 238.313 megawatts, which is 0.287 percent of the total potential.
"
10390,"3. Transport and Communication:
"
10391,"a. Roads:
"
10392,"Until the end of fiscal year 1990/91, lkm. of road served 2194 people with 3083 km. blacktopped, 2281km. graveled and 3064 kms. Fair weather road totaling 8328 km.
"
10393,"Additional 581km. of roads were constructed in F.Y. 1991/92. Out of this, 107kms.
"
10394,"Are blacktopped, 103 kms. Graveled and 371 kms.
"
10395,"b. Air Transport: By 1990/91 and 1991/92 there were, including Tribhuvan International Airport, 43 air fields in the country of different capacities, serving 1 Jet plane, 8 Avro air planes, 30 Twin otters and 4 Pilatus Porter.
"
10396,"Air service was operated to 36 destinations in the domestic sector and to ten major cities in foreign countries in 1990.91 and the same situation was maintained in the fiscal year 1991/92,too.
"
10397,"3.2 	Communication:
"
10398,"a. Postal services: By the fiscal year 1990/91, there were all together 2231 post offices consisting of 1 General post office, 74 District Post offices, 477 Area post offices and 1676 Additional Post offices.
"
10399,"The figure increased to 2271 post offices by the end of F.Y. 1991/92.
"
10400,"Thus, by the end of F.Y. 1991/92, one post office served 8146 people in an area of 65 sq. kms. b. 	Telecommunication Service:
"
10401,"The telephone line and population ration stood at 1:290 by January 1991 with the distribution of 65,298 telephone lines in 38 urban areas.
"
10402,"While STD and ISD facilities were available at 62 places on 50 districts until January 1991, these service were made available at 69 places in 55 districts by January 1992.
"
10403,"Similarly, the number of countries with ISD telephone connection increased from 38 in January 1991 to 50 in January 1992.
"
10404,"4. Social services:
"
10405,"4.1 	Education:
"
10406,"In primary education, the student enrolment reached 2, 788, 644, the number of schools 17,842 and the number of teachers 71,213 by mid April, 1990, which established the school-student ration at 1:156 and the teacher-students, schools and teachers increased respectively to 2,926,000; 18,681 and 74,849 giving rise to 1:157 school-student ration and still 1:39 teacher-student ratio.
"
10407,"In lower-secondary education, the student enrolment figure being 344,138, the number of schools 3,964 and the number of teachers 74,849, the school-student ratio remained at 1:87 and teacher-student ration at 1:28 by mid April 1990.
"
10408,"In secondary education, the figure of student enrolment, stood at 364,525, the number of schools at 1,953  ad the number of theachers at 12,399 in 1990, which resulted in 1:187 school-student ration and 1:35 teacher-student ration.
"
10409,"By 1991, the student-enrolment reached 386,000, the number of schools 2081 and the number of teachers 11,383, giving rise to a school-student ration of 1:185 ad a teacher-student ration of 1:34.
"
10410,"As part of the process to provide secondary education free of cost, tuition fees for grade VI were waived from 1991.
"
10411,"In higher technical education, the student enrolment was expected to have been 15,686 in 1990/91 and 17,919 in 1991/92. in the field of higher general education, the enrolment figure was estimated to have stood at 78,061 in 1990/91 and 91,567 in 1991/9. At the same time, a university also was established in the private sector.
"
10412,"Similarly, in order to reduce the student enrolment pressure on existing campuses and provide job-oriented education to students, a 12-class higher secondary education (10+2) programme was initiated.
"
10413,"4.2 	Health: By the fiscal year 1991/92, the number of hospitals reached 111, health posts 816, health centres 18 and Ayurved hospitals 155 and during the same period the number of doctors and women health volunteers (nurses) stood at 1,182 and 24,000 respectively.
"
10414,"Thus, the doctor-partient ration and the hospital bed- population ration reached 1:15, 800 and 1:3,967 respectively.
"
10415,"At present, the average life-expectancy of the Nepalese people is estimated to have reached 54 years.
"
10416,"Infant mortality rate stands 102, child death rate at 165, the crude birth rate at 39.60 and crude death rate at 14 per thousand respectively.
"
10417,"It is estimated that by the end of F.Y. 1990/91, 5,878,000 people in the rural areas and 1,163,000 people in the urban areas, a total of 7,041,000 people had access to drinking water facilities.
"
10418,"Out of this figure, it was in 1990/91 alone that the drinking water facility was provided to 482,899 people.
"
10419,"It is estimated that withisn F.Y. 1991/92 the drinking water facility will have been provided to an additional number of 830,000 people, 30,000 in the urban areas and 8000,000 in the rural areas.
"
10420,"Thus, according to an estimate, by the end of F.Y. 1991/92, 6,699,000 people (39 percent) in the rural sector and 1,172,000 people in the urban areas (66 percent), a total of 7,871,000 people would have has access to drinking water facilities.
"
10421,"As a result of the controlled and protection-oriented policies of the past, the economy could not achieve desired level of development and economic distortions emerged.
"
10422,"This led to anomalies in the allocation of resources.
"
10423,"In the absence of a competitive atmosphere, attention was not paid towards increasing efficiency.
"
10424,"Therefore, no satisfactory achievement could be made in the economic sector.
"
10425,"This gave was to increasing poverty problem.
"
10426,"The impact of this situation was evidently felt in the last two years, as well.
"
10427,"During the past two years, there was instability in agricultural production.
"
10428,"On the agricultural front, the development of market-oriented production pattern is necessary for the growth in integrated and coordinated manner to agricultural inputs, services, incentives and irrigation facilities.
"
10429,"At present, owing to the execessive liquidity in the economy, while the rate of consumption in increasing, the rate of savings in on the decline.
"
10430,"Consequently, compared to gross domestic product, the size of investment of late have been decreasing. The increase in government expenditure and the lack of sufficient development in laternative inves tment sectors capable of attracting private savings have led to increase in consumption and the fall in gross domestic product.
"
10431,"Therefore, it is incumbent upon His majesty’s Government to adopt suitable policy measures to bring about an increase in savings, to discourage unproductive investment and expenditure, to provide alternative sources for the mbilisation of savings and to promote private sector investment in productive areas.
"
10432,"In view of the government financial situation of the last two years, the reliance on external loans has further accentuated instead of declining because of the need for adjusting the financial deficit caused by increasing government expenditure.
"
10433,"Therefore, it is necessary to give special emphasis on the mobilisation of internal resources.
"
10434,"For this purpose, necessary steps must be taken to check the revenue pilferage and explore new sources of government revenue, to broaden the tax bases and simplify the administrative procedures. It is also essential to curtail unproductive expenditures.
"
10435,"On the monetary front, there has been an excessive increase in money supply since the last year.
"
10436,"Due to this excess liquidity in the economy, while there has been a great pressure on price situation, the ration between gross domestic product and current account deficit has remained very high (9.7 percent).
"
10437,"Under the present circumstances, the money-supply should be maintained within desirable limits without causing any undur scarcity of capital to intensify the pace of economic development.
"
10438,"The increase in net foreign assets in also exerting expansionary influence on money supply. In this context, the foreign exchange should be utilized positively and productively in order to increase productivity and employment opportunities in the economy.
"
10439,"Timely improvements on the interest rates are also required for reducing the excessive liquidity and inflation, and for promoting saving habits.
"
10440,"Similarly, the policies of loan disbursement by commercial banks in productive, priority-accorded sectors need to be intensified so as to gradually alleviate poverty through the creation of new employment opportunities for the economic upliftment of the low income rural population.
"
10441,"In the price situation, the problems of high price rise has not only reduced the competit ive capacity of the economy but also caused greas sufferings to the people.
"
10442,"Thus, it is necessary to provide relief to the people by cutting down the rate of increase in prices.
"
10443,"To attain this purpose, it will be essential especially to curtail the unproductive government expenditure, to increase the work efficiency of public undertakings, to monitor the price situation on a regular basis, to emphasize on the attainment of equilibrium in foreign trade and to improve the supply and distribution systems of essential commodities.
"
10444,"In this regard, various steps were taken to achieve a regular and convenient supply of the essential commodities for the common people such as foodgrains, salt, sugar and cement.
"
10445,"During the past two years also, the foreign trade deficit has increased and is the previous years.
"
10446,"This has led to as increase in the current account deficit, too.
"
10447,"The primary items like raw materials and a few manufactured goods still hold prominence in the country’s export trade.
"
10448,"Similarly, the trade deficit with India has increased on account of the increased import of manufactured items from India in comparison to the export of traditional agro -based and unprocessed products to that country.
"
10449,"Therefore, in order to expand the export trade, due attention must be paid to the identification of new exportable products and the amelioration of quality standards of the export items.
"
10450,"Thus, in the context of the necessity to expand trade relations with India to the benefit if Nepal, the new Nepal-India Trade and Transit Treaty has created many possible avenues for the growth of Nepal’s export trade.
"
10451,"Despite the massive investment outlay for agricultural development in each periodic plan in the past, the agriculture sector could not achieve the desired progress. Agriculture is even today primarily dependent on weather condition.
"
10452,"There has not been any marked increase in productivity.
"
10453,"Therefore, in order to achieve some concrete growth in agricultural production and productivity, it is essential to make optimum utilization of the irrigation facilities through their suithable renovation, maintenance and operation, and to establish convenient and reliable systems for the distribution of improved seeds and chemical fertilizers, the dissemination of appropriate technology and th e disbursement of agricultural loans.
"
10454,"As the drains and small irrigation projects have a great significance in agriculture and also actively involve the farmers themselves, it is highly essential to  undertake such irrigation projects on a priority basis.
"
10455,"A new industrial policy has been formulated to intensify the pace of industrial development. The new policy have brought and end to the doubts, uncertainties and distortions prevailing is the industrial sector.
"
10456,"Following the introduction of the new policy in 1992, approval has been granted by mid June to a remarkable number of industries seeking registration.
"
10457,"At the same time, while three industrial undertakings have already been privatized, the process of privatization will be further continued.
"
10458,"As the liberal and open policies professed by the new industrial policy for improvements on the economy as a whole will create a competitive industrial climate, maximum benefits must be derived from the changed climate by enhancing the industrial capabilities of the entrepreneurs involved in this sector.
"
10459,"The government owned corporations must strengthen their management to enhance their work efficiency.
"
10460,"The sick government undertakings will has to be gradually handed over to the private sector.
"
10461,"Additional efforts are required to develop the necessary infrastructure for tourism, which has evolved as a main source of foreign currency earnings, and the involvement of private sector in these efforts should be encouraged.
"
10462,"The heavy reliance on forests for the total energy consumption of the country has led to a massive destruction of forests.
"
10463,"This has had detrimental effects on environmental balance as well as agricultural production.
"
10464,"Therefore, there is a great need to achieve a consistent balance between the demand and the supply of timber and firewood by according priority to forestry development and by soliciting active participation of the people themselves in afforest ration activity.
"
10465,"In spite of the immense hydropower potential of the country, it has not been possible to significantly exploit this due to the lack of resources.
"
10466,"The hydroelectricity and irrigation facilities need to be expanded through necessary arrangements of means and resources for the maximum utilization of hydro power.
"
10467,"Viewed on the basis of cost factor, it seems appropriate to give more emphasis in the construction of small and medium scale hydro electric projects than on iarge scale projects.
"
10468,"Greater involvement of orivate sector in required in the generaion and distribution of hydro -electricity, too.
"
10469,"One the transport front, although some roads were constructed in the past years, there are still no link roads to some district headquarters.
"
10470,"Further, as not much attention was paid to the proper alignment of the rode during construction, the roads have not able to intensify the economic activities of the people living in the road corridors.
"
10471,"Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the task of constructing link road to district headquarters and other feeder roads on the basis of economic feasibility studies and also to the repairs and maintenance of old roads.
"
10472,"In the field of social services, the country has not been able to derive much benefit except for some progress in  the field of education.
"
10473,"The lack of qualitative development in education is the main reason for this situation.
"
10474,"Therefore, while keeping education in agreement with moral norm and values, attention must be paid to developing the quality of education and making it job-oriented.
"
10475,"Higher education faces scarcity of physical facilities for standard pedagogy and is heavily reliant on government grants.
"
10476,"There still persists the problem of maintaining the academic calendar, which has as adverse effect on students’ future.
"
10477,"Therefore, it is imperative to develop a time bound educational framework and encourage the private sector involvement in higher education.
"
10478,"Similarly, there has emerged an urgent need to upgrade the quality of primary and secondary education.
"
10479,"The country has not been able to derive potential benefits from the investment made in the health sector as well.
"
10480,"The physical infrastructure in health sector in being gradually developed and a big investment has also been made in the production of health manpower.
"
10481,"However, while there is a regular complaint from people concerning the unavailability searcity of medcines and manpower in hospitals and health ectres, the burden of the increasing population on exerting a heavy pressure on social services, and this population growth has minimized the impact of development achievements.
"
10482,"No significant education has been achieven in the growth rates of population and infant mortality.
"
10483,"In this context, it has become essential to make maximum possible utilization of existing physical facilities, manpower and service and to extend additional facilities to rural areas.
"
10484,"The supply of water, in areas where the facility exists, too, has not been able to meet the requirement.
"
10485,"There also persists the problem of purification of drinking water.
"
10486,"On the other hand, it is estimated that about 40 percent of the available drinking water is being list through leakage.
"
10487,"Therefore, attention must be paid to the control of leakage and the purification if drinking water along with the extension of drinking water facilities.
"
10488,"The problem of unorganized housing and urbanization has acquired great magnitude.
"
10489,"Therefore, there has  emerged and urgent need to formulate and implement timely policies and programmes with regard to housing and urbanization.
"
10490,"Against the backdrop of the above mentioned problems and challenges, the elected government formed after the general elections of 1991 has initiated in accordance with its manifesto various efforts for the all-round development of Nepal.
"
10491,"The present government now has to undertake the responsibility of achieving the economic disorder and distortions of the past.
"
10492,"Matching the spirit if the challenge, the government has been striving for reforms in economic management by according priority to liberal economic policies and rural areas.
"
10493,"Similarly, appropriate steps have been taken by the popularly elected government in the direction of creating a favourable climate for the development of the private sector.
"
10494,"This has already led to some positive results.
"
10495,"Several programmes have been initiated to include the rural sector in the main stream of development.
"
10496,"However, the country’s basic structure if the economy is still very weak.
"
10497,"The economic growth rate is low and it is essential to bring about qualitative reforms in the economic structure in order to achieve a sustainable and long lasting growth rate.
"
10498,"The depth and extent of poverty, unemployment, the growing disparity between rural and urban sectors and unequitable distribution if development efforts on the days to come.
"
10499,"The eights play is a significant step initiated in that direction.
"
10500,"Different fiscal years have been taken as base years in the preparation of the foregoing chapter.
"
10501,"(a) The final year of the first five-year plan (1956-1961) was 1960/61.
"
10502,"However, before the end of the plan period, the erstwhile democratically elected Nepali congress government was dissolved in December, 1960. subsequently, there were continued efforts from 1961/62 to install panchayat system and as that year was taken as the base year for the second plan (1962-1965) also, the same year i.e. 1961/62 has been taken as the initial year for comparative studies.
"
10503,"(b) 	The fiscal year 1961/62 remained a year without a plan.
"
10504,"No efforts were made that year for the formulation and implementation of plan.
"
10505,"As a result, the fiscal year 1961/62 data were not available ofr certain statistical comparative studies.
"
10506,"The year 1960/61 has been taken as the base for the analysis if those sectors where the 1961/62 data were not available.
"
10507,"(c) 	Similarly, the data of national income projections in Nepal are available only from the year 1964/65. Therefore, the data that require comparison with national income could be made use of only from the year 1964/65 onwards.
"
10508,"Besides, because of the unavoidability of using the constant prices if 1964/65 as the base for conversion of certain data to constant prices on the basis of GDP, the fiscal year 1964/65 has been taken as the initial year at certain places and the analysis has been made accordingly.
"
10509,"(d) 	In addition, it is appropriate to evaluate government financial position on the basis of current and constant process.
"
10510,"In transforming certain date related to financial position to constant prices, the use of the urban consumer price indices rather than that of implicit deflators of GDP in more practical. However, as the price indices are available from 1972/73 only, it was possible process only from that year.
"
10511,"(e) 	As the date relating to the balance of payments situation are available from the year 1974/75 only, the corresponding analysis has been presented beginning from that year.
"
10512,"Nevertheless, in order to assist interested persons interested in of undertaking separate analysis and arriving at relevant conclusions, that data pertaining to the fiscal year 1961/62, 1964/65, 1972/73, 1974/75 and 1989/90 have been presented separately in some tables. 2	Based on the production price (gross) of 18 industrial goods as per 1976/77 industrial census.
"
10513,"The people have, subsequent to the restoration of democracy through the historic people’s movement of 1990, entrusted the responsibility of the country’s development to the Nepali congress by giving its mandate with a clear majority in the general elections.
"
10514,"While, on the on hand, the government will definitely have to make some harsh decisions, the development perspectives, on the other hand, will need to be compatible with the prevailing national situation and the economic changes in the international scenario.
"
10515,"As Nepali congress in committed to democratic socialism, the principal objective of the economic policy will be the amelioration of the standard of living of the deprived citizens through democratic processes.
"
10516,"Socialism, as conceived by the Nepali congress, it not orthodox socialism where the state dictates but the one by virtue of which the state in a supportive role will bring about social and economic justice through increase in production, creation of employment and special programmes directed towards the upliftment of the socially and economically deprived poor people who are left out of the mainstream of development.
"
10517,"It is evident from the changes occurring in the socialist countries that the traditional state directed socialism is no longer suited to the existing global economic scenario.
"
10518,"Therefore, the state directed and controlled economic systems pursued for the last thirty years will be gradually phased out and policies will be adopted to carry out development through free market-oriented liberal economic systems.
"
10519,"In this perspective, the goals and objectives defined in the Eighth plan will be considered as indicative and as guidelines, the fulfillment of which requires the participation and support of all sections of the nation together with the capabilities of the state.
"
10520,"The experience of several developing nations has demonstrated the fallacy of the concept that an high economic plans in Nepal, too, in the past were based on this concept and the consequences turned out to be quite contradictory.
"
10521,"Neither the targeted growth rate was achieved, nor was poverty alleviated.
"
10522,"Indicates that for economic growth social and administrative reforms must concomitantly accompany capital investment.
"
10523,"In view of this fact during the Eighth plan period, a conducive environment will be created for development by complementing capital investment with reforms in the age-old traditional social norms and values and inefficient administrative system fostered by the panchayat regime.
"
10524,"As efforts aimed at raising the economic growth rate do not necessarily benefit the poor to a significant extent, special programmes will be undertaken for poverty alleviation at village level and household level.
"
10525,"Since continuity in development can not be achieved without a sustained rate of growth, this plan will adopt a self-sustainable development process from the village level onwards.
"
10526,"For this purpose, it is necessary to develop and mobilize human resources from the village level, to develop and extend the infrastructure for rural development and to attain minimum standard of living for the common rural populace.
"
10527,"As this kind of development can not be achieved through traditional planning system, the pronouncement of late B.P. Koirala-“Plans or budgets should be formulated with the peasant in mind … every Nepali should have a small house to live in and a milk cow in the court yard” will serve as the guideline in making decisions concerning development programmes in the Eight plant.
"
10528,"While allocating government expenditure, rural and backward areas will receive priority in order to build infrastructure for development such as extension of roads and irrigation, to make institutional and technical improvements in the agricultural system.
"
10529,"To create employment opportunities for the rural population and to meet basic needs such as education, health care, drinking water and housing.
"
10530,"For this purpose, the budgetary allocation of funds for rural development will be increased to seventy percent of the total development budget outlay.
"
10531,"This new philosophy of planning will be reflected in the procedural structure and methodology of the plan.
"
10532,"Development is not merely a mechanical function of capital and technology but it is also a social and political process of mobilizing and organizing people commensurate with the desired goals.
"
10533,"It is essential to canalize the aspirations and enthusiasm of the people generated by the political change in the country to the mainstream of development, and to identify, formulate, implement and distribute the benefits thereof on the basis of people’s participat ion.
"
10534,"Compatible with the nature of projects and development programmes, conducive environment will be created to involve peasants, laborers and entrepreneurs, engaging the concerned people themselves and the central and effective source of all actions and decisions.
"
10535,"The proposed planning methodology will create a basis for sustained development by promoting development initiatives at the community level by enhancing mass awareness for self- development, fostering civic responsibility and self-reliance.
"
10536,"In order to fully translate such development process into practice, the Government will adopt the policy of decentralization.
"
10537,"Authority was not decentralized to local level bodies.
"
10538,"Since these bodies were directed by both the concerned ministries and local administration, a state of confusion prevailed in their work performance.
"
10539,"In accordance with the policies of democratic socialism, the formulation of plans will eliminate the top down approach to be replaced by the bottom up approach.
"
10540,"As long as the development of the people, for the people and by the people is not institutionalized, possibly a conducive atmosphere may not be created for the realization of development among the common masses of the population.
"
10541,"In order to create such environment the government has lready authorized local bodies to select, formulate and implement development projects, to allocate the distribution of benefits derived through such projects.
"
10542,"For the purpose of avoiding delays in the implementation of development projects, the methods of the disbursement of funds will be simplified and the allocated funds made available in good time.
"
10543,"Similarly, local bodies will be empowered to approve tenders for the supply of construction materials and the construction services for local development projects.
"
10544,"In order to avoid the lack if onside data and information necessary for the selection of development programmes at the local level, data will be collected and maintained up-to –date at the district level on a regular basis.
"
10545,"Concomitantly with the decentralization of authority, the local bodies will be motivated to bear responsibilities.
"
10546,"While village level bodies will be accountable to the district level bodies, they in turn, will be accountable to the centre.
"
10547,"It will be made mandatory that the bodies at all levels keep their accounts transparent.
"
10548,"As the success of the centralization programme depends to a large extent on the abilities and attitudes of the local level employees, arrangeme3nts will be made for upgrading their work- performance through training and career development opportunities.
"
10549,"The wide disparity in economic and social facilities between the rural and urban areas has led to unprecedented increase in migration to urban areas.
"
10550,"This has, on the one hand, exerted heavy pressure on drinking water supply system, education health care and transports and also led to greater pollution in urban area, while on the other, the economic and social conditions in the rural areas have further worsened.
"
10551,"With a view to rectify these anomalies, in this context, complementary enterprises and economic activities compatible with the regional means and resources will be implemented.
"
10552,"The balanced development of all sectors in equally important in view if the government’s commitment to rural development an d upliftment of the standard of living of the poor people.
"
10553,"Regional development will be linked to the village level development and a suitable atmosphere for all citizens to share the returns of the nation’s investment will be created.
"
10554,"To promote regional balance, special grants will be made available during the eighth plan for specific projects on addition to the lump sum government grants to the regions.
"
10555,"The local bodies upon mutual consultations and agreement may use the funds thus provided for specified projects on the basis of regional necessities.
"
10556,"The optimum utilization of regionally available means and resources will also enhance the national production.
"
10557,"As agriculture is the backbone of the national economy and the livelihood of 90 percent of population is associated with this sector, the eighth plan lays special emphasis on the development and modernization of the agricultural sector.
"
10558,"The agricultural development also deserves priority as this alone can increase the income of the common people and thereby expand internal maker for industrial sector.
"
10559,"Low cost farming activities with higher rate of return such as intensive farming, horticulture, multiple crop farming, animal husbandry, bee keeping, sericulture, herbs and medicinal plant farming etc. will be promoted for the development of agricultural sector.
"
10560,"At the same time, the genetic diversity of agricultural crops will be utilized for the development of export-oriented products.
"
10561,"The diversification in agriculture will also assist in maintaining the ecological balance.
"
10562,"As mentioned above, the government does not believe in excessive government control in economic activities. The private sector, in a controlled economy, can not invest independently and make decisions concerning primary activities such as production and sale, which tends to direct the flow if investment not towards sustainable area but towards the areas that deliver short-term gains This leads to distortions in economy and the economy lose dynamism causing debility in economic structure.
"
10563,"Controlled economic policed pursued by the panchayat regime in the past have given rise to distortions in the industrial structure as they promoted industrial and commercial activities which did not enhance any significant price value at the processing stage but were only profitable in the highly protected Indian market.
"
10564,"The non-transparent economic policies and regulations have given rise to rent seeking behaviour causing a considerable weakening of the financial administration.
"
10565,"Under such circumstances, while genuine entrepreneurs become discouraged, industrialists and traders, adept at exploiting non-transparent policies to their benefits, will have the upper hand.
"
10566,"As such industrialists are more concerned with investing for short term personal gains rather than for long germ national economy.
"
10567,"In view if these facts, the government will abandon the past policies of excessive control and intervention, and adopt open and liberal policies.
"
10568,"Aware of the failure of the government sector all over the world in the production and delivery of goods through resource allocation, the government will assume the role of a catalyst and promote of private sector rather than controlling or interfering with their economic activities.
"
10569,"Thus, limiting the scope of the government to some specific areas, the development and extension of all other areas will be left open to private sector.
"
10570,"The principal role of the government will be to develop physical infrastructure necessary for economic development, such as roads and communications, to bring the people so far left out into the mainstream of development, by providing basic social services such as health care, education and drinking water, essential to the long-term national development, the participation of the private sector in these areas, too, will be welcomed, the government will initiate a process of disengagement and disinvestment from a number of areas that may be managed more efficiently by the private sector without jeopardizing social interests.
"
10571,"In accordance with this policy, government owned enterprises and corporations will be gradually privatized.
"
10572,"Sp ecial attention will be paid to protect private sector participation on various economic activities.
"
10573,"In respect of several development activities, the private sector and non-governmental organizations can evidently be more effective in terms of cost, flexibility, motivation and initiative.
"
10574,"The non -governmental organizations which are more motivated by social service then profit and also more experienced in working in close association with rural people, are better suited to the tasks of rural development and poverty alleviation.
"
10575,"If these organizations are allowed to play and active role in rural development, there will emerge improvements in income distribution.
"
10576,"Considering the fact that the non -governmental organizational and community organizations have been effectively engaged in rural development over the past several years, such organizations will be involved to the maximum possible extent in development activities during the eighth plan.
"
10577,"For this purpose the government will remove the policy obstacles and hindrances being faced by these organizations and adopt promotional policies.
"
10578,"The following will be undertaken to this end.
"
10579,"a. 	Simplification and clarification of administrative processes in order to private initiative from being suppressed.
"
10580,"b. Removal of unnecessary delays to accelerate the government of government policies, and
"
10581,"For the aforementioned purpose, plans are underway to review the license system and all other existing policies and regulations with a view to increasing the involvement of private sector and nongovernmental organizations in the economic development of the country.
"
10582,"Laws and regulations r elating to registration and the structure of non-governmental organizations will be simplified and in order to make them capable of mobilizing internal resources to a greater extent, necessary improvements will be made in the legal provisions concerning taxation.
"
10583,"Contact and communication with non -governmental organizations will be enhanced in order to understand their problems and provide necessary support.
"
10584,"The non-governmental organizations will be given full autonomy to function in specific priority areas.
"
10585,"To promote the initiative of private sector and non-governmental organizations in development works, the government will invest in transport, communications, energy, education and public health and develop infrastructure in various parts of the country.
"
10586,"While formulating and executing the economic and social infrastructure for rural development through these organizations, particular attention will be paid to the interest of the entire village rather then to that of an individual.
"
10587,"International non-governmental organizations have been playing a significant role over the pats several years in the development functions in Nepal.
"
10588,"These organizations will be encouraged to work in areas where they can operate more effectively on the basis of their expertise, comparative advantages and recognition.
"
10589,"The selection of areas will be made as far as possible in keeping with the policy of balanced regional development.
"
10590,"As Nepal is a severely resource constrained country, it would not be an exaggeration to state that the development process can not be further advanced without foreign assistance.
"
10591,"Reliance on foreign assistance without any concrete plan and without paying due attention to the optimum utilization of the assistance during the thirty years of the panchayat regime has given rise to many undesirable consequences placing the country unde3r the burden of foreign debts.
"
10592,"Therefore, during the eighth plan period, foreign assistance will be sought only for such priority projects which may not be sustained through internal resources and due attention will be paid to ensuring the maximum effectiveness in the utilization of the assistance.
"
10593,"Structural adjustment loans form t he World Bank and the international monetary fund will also be put to effective use.
"
10594,"In this connection, the regular budget will be streamlined in respect of government expenditure, revenue will be increased through appropriate monetary and fiscal policies , the growth rate of money supply will be maintained within desirable limits and efforts will be made to increase exports through product diversification.
"
10595,"These efforts will br ought stability to national economy and encourage private sector to increase inv estment in productive activities.
"
10596,"Objectives and priorities of the Eighth Plan
"
10597,"Objectives The broad objective of the eighth plan is to given definite direction to the social and economic upliftem ent of the citizens of the country by tackling the challenges of economic stagnation, increasing poverty, structural anomalies, environmental degradation and rapid population growth.
"
10598,"A single five year plan can not find a remedy to all these problems but it is imperative to take concrete steps in that direction.
"
10599,"The plan will make all possible efforts in this regard.
"
10600,"The principal objectives that the plan aspires to achieve are as following:
"
10601,"a. Sustainable economic growth
"
10602,"b. Poverty alleviation, and
"
10603,"c. 	Reduction of regional imbalances
"
10604,"a. Sustainable Economic Growth One of the principal objectives of the plan is to achieve a high and sustainable rate of economic growth without which there is no possibility of achieving economic prosperity and its continuity.
"
10605,"The economy will not be able to fulfill the developmental aspirations of the common people without a sustainable and high economic growth rate.
"
10606,"The eight plans is determined to achieve a high growth rate and ensure its continuity objective of achieving a high & sustainable growth rate in the development efforts of the country.
"
10607,"Sustainable economic growth also implies the management of the available bio-physical resources in the most productive manner without damaging or depleting these resources.
"
10608,"The demand for such biophysical resources should not exceed their sustainable supply capacity. However, the present population of the country is already placing excessive demands on existing resources.
"
10609,"If the present trend of population growth is allowed to continue, it will not be possible to meet the demands of the people without causing permanent damage to the bio-physical resources.
"
10610,"Therefore, it is highly essential to reduce the rate of population growth in order to achieve a sustainable economic growth rate.
"
10611,"To achieve the above mentioned objective, this plan has called for the involvement of private sector and increased people’s participation at the community level.
"
10612,"The plan has made additional efforts to increase the productivity of the productivity of the labour force and to make the financial investment more productive.
"
10613,"Similarly, programmes with higher comparative advantages will be implemented in agriculture, industry, tourism and other sectors.
"
10614,"Comparative advantages can be achieved by the utilization of low cost hydro-electricity and other natural resources in the production process.
"
10615,"This will produce a comparative advantages especially in energy -oriented industries and irrigated cultivable land.
"
10616,"For this purpose, the advanced technology and institutional reforms will be made indispensable tools of support to the private sector and organizations down to the village level and production will be increased on the basis of equity and capability.
"
10617,"b. Poverty alleviation
"
10618,"Despite the development efforts of the past, the population living below the poverty line has been steadily increasing and the majority of such poverty ridden people live in the rural areas.
"
10619,"The biggest challenge for the present government is to alleviate poverty from the rural sector. it is the root cause of many of the existing problems of Nepal such as population growth, environmental degradation and social anomalies.
"
10620,"Therefore, another principal objective of this plan is to alleviate poverty.
"
10621,"Although poverty is the result of diverse factors, the basic causes of poverty in Nepal are the dependence of the increasing population on limited economic resources and low rate of economic growth.
"
10622,"The visible impediments to economic growth such as natural constraints, preliminary stage of development efforts, low productivity, subsistence agricultural system and slackness in the expansion of non-agricultural sector are the major factors for a weak economic base.
"
10623,"In this perspective, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and inter -regional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive, emphasis is given on formulating integrated and inter-regional programmes that primarily focus on the creation of productive assets base and additional employment opportunities to alleviate poverty, extension of social services like health education, vocational training and drinking water, and effective management and protection of natural resources.
"
10624,"As part of the planning and implementation processes programmes will be implemented with the objective of benefiting the population living below the poverty line.
"
10625,"Despite policy-pronouncements and efforts in the previous plans, disparities between rural and urban areas and among development regions have increased. Over the recent years, there has been an increased trend of migration from rural to urban areas.
"
10626,"Hills to terai migration continue.
"
10627,"If the disparity in urban and rural income is not reduced, this trend my gain greater momentum.
"
10628,"Similarly, in comparison with other development regions, far western region and mid western region lag far behind in respect of infrastructural and social service facilities and other development works.
"
10629,"The living standard of the people of these regions have adversely affected by the growing disparity of income distribution caused by these factors.
"
10630,"This has further complicated the creation of equal opportunities for sharing development benefits.
"
10631,"In this context, maintenance of regional balance forms another objective of he Eighth plan.
"
10632,"While allocating resources in order to achieve regional balance, due attention has been paid to the necessity of creating physical infrastructure in these less developed regions.
"
10633,"With this objective, while special emphasis has been given on the extension of rural roads, due importance has been attached to the provision of facilities like primary heath care, education and drinking water in rural sector.
"
10634,"The regional complementary interrelationships between the hills and the Terai arising out of the existing agro-ecological conditional can be beneficially utilized for agricultural and industrial specialization.
"
10635,"Therefore, the current and future development perspectives will be accorded special emphasis in order to benefit from the ecological interrelationships between the Hills and Terai.
"
10636,"Focusing on the development of less development regions, special emphasis will be laid on the reduction of regional imbalances.
"
10637,"In order to achieve the principal objectives mentioned above, it has become essential to improve economic standard of rural people the achieve self-sustaining rural development through the increased provision of social, economic and market services, and increased access to drinking water and alternative forms of energy.
"
10638,"In view of the limited financial, human and institutional resources of the country, it will not be possible to provide adequate resources to all activities within a single plan period.
"
10639,"This plan will in the course of resource allocation, accord priority to such programmes whose completion provides necessary support to another or those which have a high economic benefit.
"
10640,"The programmes receiving priority in this plan are:
"
10641,"(a) 	Agricultural Intensification and Diversification: it is being increasingly realized that the contribution of agriculture to the overall economic development of the nation is not only determined by the growth rate of agriculture but also by its pattern.
"
10642,"Development strategies which broaden the base of agricultural development also promote accelerated growth in other areas.
"
10643,"In a development system that encompasses the majority of the population, a greater numger of producers including the marginal ones can have access to the increased rural income.
"
10644,"The demands of such producers are usually related to the goods and services which uses maximum local resources and labour.
"
10645,"For the attainment of equitable economic development, it is necessary to accelerate demands for labour and to expedite food supply.
"
10646,"The agricultural sector alone contributes about three fifths of the gross national product and provides employment to nearly eight tenths of the entire population.
"
10647,"Agriculture is that sector which will be able to involve, although only for a short or medium period, the rapidly increasing labour force in productive activities.
"
10648,"As there are severe limitations on expanding the cultivable land, this plan has accorded priority to agricultural intensification and diversification.
"
10649,"With adequate provisions of necessary agricultural support services, intensive farming will be introduced in areas with access to irrigation facilities.
"
10650,"In such areas, the emphasis will mainly be laid on cereal production.
"
10651,"Depending upon the suitability of climatic conditions and access to services, agricultural diversification in cash -crops, horticultures, vegetable farming and livestock will be emphasized.
"
10652,"In order to meet the urban demand for milk, eggs, fish, meat, fruits and vegetables, priority will be given to intensive productions programmes in areas adjacent to the cities and along road corridors to urban areas.
"
10653,"Sericulture, bee keeping medicinal herb farming and similar significant but low-cost small -scale activities will be encouraged to increase the income of the farmers in the hills and the mountains.
"
10654,"(b) 	Energy Development
"
10655,"Energy plays an important role in the economy, in respect of both domestic and exports sectors of the economy.
"
10656,"Although the country is well endowed with abundant biomass and hydropower resources, the pace of industrialization is felt to have slowed down in the recent year mainly because of the lack of energy and power.
"
10657,"While it implies that rapid industrial growth is not possible without tackling the energy constraints, the growth of agricultural production may be impeded by the lack of energy for life-irrigation and processing of agricultural products.
"
10658,"If an elementary machinery lick water million, diesel engine and bio-gas plants could be developed in the rural areas, it will contribute immensely to the development of food processing industries and cottage industries.
"
10659,"Nepal’s vast potential to generate comparatively cheap hydropower provides comparative advantages in many energy through modern technology and its integration with the development of other sectors of the economy can enhance sectoral productivity as well as comparative advantages.
"
10660,"For instance, it will be possible to transfer the traditional agricultural pattern to modern agricultural system through the use of electricity in lift irrigation, making use of technology and fertilizers.
"
10661,"This will lead to a considerable increase in agricultural productivity as well as a decrease in foreign currency expenditure for the import of diesel.
"
10662,"All these considerations clearly indicate that energy development should be accorded high priority in Nepal’s development planning.
"
10663,"c. 	Development of Rural Infrastructure in order to support industrial growth, the market for industrial production will be expanded in rural areas by providing roads and other forms of transportation linking rural communities and market centres. Market facilities will be intensively improved in order to aid the convenient supply of necessary agricultural inputs as well as the sale and purchase of surplus agricultural produce.
"
10664,"Necessary infrastructure will be built for the development of rural irrigation, drinking water, electricity, communications, rural industries and tourism etc. providing the basic facilities of life such as suspension bridges, schools and health care, the environment in the villages will be made comfortably in the rural areas.
"
10665,"The rural development infrastructure will provide employment opportunities to the growing labour force of the rural sector.
"
10666,"Therefore, this plan has accorded high priority to the creation of the entire infrastructure if rural development.
"
10667,"d. 	Employment Generation and Human Resource Development
"
10668,"The creation of productive employment opportunities in the country has been given top priority by this plan.
"
10669,"In order to create employment opportunities at an accelerated rate, all possible avenues have been explored in the sectoral programmes.
"
10670,"Since nearly 90 percent of the population live in rural areas, the plan has laid special emphasis on generating greater employment opportunities in rural areas.
"
10671,"Thus, the plan has emphasized on bigger investment in rural areas for the development of non-agricultural activities such as development and renovation of infrastructure, expansion of agriculture through the use of electricity and cottage industries based on local energy resources.
"
10672,"This plan has made arrangements of adequate resources of further productive involvement of the existing human resources in the efforts of national development.
"
10673,"Since the existing labour force is largely illiterate and unskilled, basic education and technical and vocational training opportunities will be expanded with particular emphasis on rural areas.
"
10674,"e. 	Control of Population Growth the available resources in the country cannot forever sustain the current rate of population growth.
"
10675,"The rapid increase in population leaves only an insignificant portion of resources for development works.
"
10676,"There can be no prospect for a substantial increase in the average income of the people if the population is allowed to grow at the present rate.
"
10677,"Therefore, the reduction in the rate of population growth is one of the priority areas of this plan.
"
10678,"The family planning devices are still not readily available in various parts of the country.
"
10679,"It has been proved that family planning devices are being used only in areas with the spread of literacy among women and with easy access to primary health facilities, and in families with high standard of living.
"
10680,"Therefore, this plan has placed special emphasis on the awareness creation programmes to increase in the demand for family planning devices.
"
10681,"f. 	Industrial Development and Tourism Promotion
"
10682,"Economic prosperity depends upon a rapid sustainable economic development.
"
10683,"For the attainment of accelerated economic development in the country, industrialization is equally as important as that of agriculture and other primary sectors.
"
10684,"The industrialization, in the process of value added contributes, to the creation of new employment opportunities and economic integration.
"
10685,"The eight h plan policies have been so formulated that they will promote the sustainable growth of large as well as cottage industries.
"
10686,"During this plan period, an atmosphere favourable to the open and competitive growth of industries will be created and expanded.
"
10687,"The private sector as well as foreign investors will be particularly encouraged through appropriate policy measures to invest in the industrial sector.
"
10688,"Similarly, tourism sector will be promoted in order to generate increased foreign exchange, employment and income.
"
10689,"However, owing to the constraints in the supply of necessary commodities and insufficient and incompatible initiatives, tourism has so far been a seasonal phenomenon and has not been able to make the desired headway.
"
10690,"In order to make use of  all feasible development prospects, the eights plan has accorded special priority to the overall development of this sector.
"
10691,"The government will invest in the creation of infrastructure of industry and tourism, and provide support to the private sector.
"
10692,"Policies will be continued to be effectively implemented so as to induce the domestic and foreign investors to increases their investment with confidence and to generate higher returns as cooperated to the rate of investment.
"
10693,"In this connection, some pioneering steps have already been taken with regard to policy matter.
"
10694,"g. 	Export promotion and Diversification
"
10695,"The rapid widening of trade and current account deficits in recent years has become a matter of serious concern to the country. the complications in the export of traditional and some new kinds of manufactured goods and the quantitative decline in the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the agricultural products have contributed to the narrowing of the export base of Nepal.
"
10696,"The market available to Nepalese exporters in limited.
"
10697,"These factors have impeded the attainment of stability in the growth of export.
"
10698,"Although the carpet and garment industries have re3corded a significant growth in export earnings over the recent years, in views of quality control, proper organizational structure, large scale production and innovations in the production patterns, it is necessary to improve the quality standards of the products for markets to which they have been usually exported.
"
10699,"New products have not been successfully identified as yes for export promotion programmes.
"
10700,"The growth of the export sector has been restricted due to the lack of clear-cut export policies and low priority accorded to it in the past.
"
10701,"The eighth plan has given priority to the production and promotion of both traditional agricultural commodities and new exportable products.
"
10702,"This plan has adopted the strategy of promoting market oriented production which will contribute to the development of production as well as market facilities.
"
10703,"h. 	Macro-Economic Stabilization
"
10704,"The expansionary policy adopted in the past has given rise to excessive liquidity, increasing money supply, increasing trade imbalance and high price rise.
"
10705,"This has weakened the stability of the economy.
"
10706,"Under the given circumstances, the policies of macro economic stabilization and structural adjustments can play a significant role in the attainment of the objective of stability in economic growth rate.
"
10707,"In this connection, the plan has given special emphasis to a more rational allocation of resources, better management of public expenditures, enhanced mobilization of internal resources, greater performance in public sector investment and the strengthening of public enterprises, open and simple foreign exchange policies and regulations, and prudent fiscal and monetary policies.
"
10708,"Due emphasis has been given on the reinforcement of the present financial system in order to further mobilize savings in the private sector.
"
10709,"Encouragement has been provided to the establishment of new financial institutions and the development of capital markets.
"
10710,"Exploration of new methods of saving has been encouraged by removing the control of the central bank on the fixation of interest rates.
"
10711,"i. Reforms in Development Administration
"
10712,"The increasing proportion of administrative cost in development investment and slow decision making processes have led delays in the projects implementation.
"
10713,"As the employees in public sectors consume, even at the existing low salary scales., a major share of the government revenue only a meager portion of it is available of capital investment.
"
10714,"The lack of a suitable working atmosphere, the gradual decline in the morale of civil servants and the lack of the sense of responsibility can be cited as examples of additional constraints.
"
10715,"There is a treat need for reforms in the exi sting system of recruitment, positing, training and promotion.
"
10716,"During this plan period, reforms through appropriate measures will be introduced in order to make the development administration capable enough to meet the challenges of national development.
"
10717,"j. Monitoring and Evaluation
"
10718,"While the planned projects are not usually implemented on time, the project subsequent to their implementation, too, have failed to produce the desired result.
"
10719,"This has led to a disparity between planning and implementation, and between implementation and achievements, which have been a matter of great concern to the government as well as donor countries.
"
10720,"In such grave circumstances, the government has fully understood the need for institutionalization of the monitoring and evaluation systems with respect to development projects and programmes.
"
10721,"During the plan period, an effective monitoring and evaluation system will be devised and institutionalized, which will not only ensure the timely implementation of projects but also encourage management accountability and performance oriented evaluation system in the public sector.
"
10722,"Economic Growth Rate, Total Investment And Sectoral Allocations
"
10723,"Macro economic bases of Eighth Plan
"
10724,"Consistency among objectives, policies, programmes and investment must be established in the course of formulating a plan.
"
10725,"With a view to eliminating the disparity between investment plan and targets and making the plan more realistic, the plan should frame an investment programme using appropriate techniques, based on the proper assessment of all viable alternatives, Similarly, and estimate needs to be made with regard to the availability of resources as well as the growth rate likely to be achieved during the plan period on the basis of alternative sectoral plans.
"
10726,"In the past, the plans did not pay required attention to these aspects, nor was an appropriate planning methodology used, The economic growth rate was determined in the initial stage of planning based on external variables.
"
10727,"Therefore, the extent if requisite investment of the plan was fixed on the basis of crude incremental capital output ratios.
"
10728,"This methodology did not pay due at tention of the need to establish coordination between various internal and external variables.
"
10729,"This was a closed economy concept, which disregards the analysis of interrelationships among diverse economic areas.
"
10730,"There were particularly there vita flaws in this methodology.
"
10731,"Firstly, the fact that the availability of resources is determined by the implementation of the plan and the economic achievement to be made during the plan period was neglected. This led to arbitrary estimates of resources likely to be available in the plan period.
"
10732,"Secondly, as this methodology fixes the investment requirement based in incremental capital output ration with total disregard to economy in sectoral allocations and better result-oriented standards, it can not be utilized in the evaluation of alternative resource allocations and in the analysis of the effects of alternative investment plan on production, employment and other variables as a whole.
"
10733,"Thirdly, it does not help in the analysis of programmes and alternative policies, and in the assessment and formulation of these programmes and policies in the perspective of attaining total objective
"
10734,"The techniques of macro-model have been employed in the formulation of the Eighth Plan.
"
10735,"This helps to assess the probable effects of alternative investment programme on the economy.
"
10736,"According to this methodology.
"
10737,"a. The total and sectoral value added has been determined within the framework of the model and the fact that the total and sectoral investment has a decisive impact on the overall economic growth rate has been taken into consideration.
"
10738,"b. The total sectoral demands for labour are primarily determined by the growth rates of production in various sectors.
"
10739,"c. 	Budgetary deficit, monetary and structural variables of the economy cause monetary expansion and price determination.
"
10740,"Budgetary deficit affects imports as well as balance of payments, which is a peculiar characteristic of a small economy like our.
"
10741,"d. 	Total investment is fixed by the extent of external and internal savings, and thus in turn, by the supply of investment resources too.
"
10742,"e. 	The sectoral incremental capital output rations have been estimated on the basis of internal processes of the model.
"
10743,"This will assist in the assessment of the probable effects of alternative investment programmes on medium term economic growth and short term economic stability.
"
10744,"This will also facilitate the evaluation of the impact on the economy of the growth of economic efficiency created by the sectoral policy measures such as appropriate regional allocation of resources, selection of suitable projects and monitoring system, prudent economic management, economic openness and privatization.
"
10745,"The modeling technique will make it possible to assess the prevailing or the likely negative influence on the economy of low productivity, supply and structural constraints, lack of prudence in the allocation and utilization of resources and the unnecessary government interfence in various economic sectors.
"
10746,"Likewise this will also help in evaluating the probable effects on the economy from the probable growth in saving brought about by the favourable changes in the internal and external economic environment, reduction in unproductive government expenditure and the accelerated growth of investment in industries.
"
10747,"Thus, there is a great need for additional reforms in spite of the various reforms proposed in this plan period.
"
10748,"The modeling technique adopted in the Eighth plan cannot contribute much to the task of evaluating interregional relationships and the flow of regional means and resources, as it is devoted to the analysis of cumulative constraints as a whole.
"
10749,"Therefore, the National planning commission has accorded priority to the collection of additional data and the extension of planning methodology.
"
10750,"This will facilitate the further analysis of various aspects of interregional relations in the future. Police Bases
"
10751,"In the past, there existed a vast gulf between the target and the achievements of the plans.
"
10752,"In the absence of appropriate policy, strategy and programmes, the economy became increasingly cost oriented and the government expenditure was getting more inclined toward unproductive sectors, difficult to be sustained by the economy.
"
10753,"The increasing government participation and interference and the lack of a favorable atmosphere for the involvement of private sector also contributed to the slow growth of the industrial sector.
"
10754,"The major share of the private sector was attracted towards the unproductive areas such as real estate.
"
10755,"The increased loss in the government owned corporations, the excessive expansion of the government expenditures and the excessive dependence in deficit budgeting for compensatory measures created greater impediments to the task of promoting medium and long term development programmes, gradually imparting stability to the economy at the same time.
"
10756,"These trends continue to exist even today.
"
10757,"The nation faces the complex challenges of accelerating the economic development, alleviating poverty and reducing regional imbalances and raising the living standard if the people in a short period through and extensive increase in employment opportunities against the backdrop of the scarcity of means and resources.
"
10758,"Thus, at present there is a persistent need for extensive policy reforms and changes.
"
10759,"Therefore, the Eights plan has adopted in its formulation some policy bases such as the allocation of investment in high productive areas in keeping with the priorities accorded by the plan; the attainment of performance efficiency in industry, communications, trade, hotel keeping, finance and real estate, through appropriate management of government expenditure; control of government expenses; introduction of suitable selection process and work-performance monitoring systems in the formulation and implementation of the plan; promotion of private sector involvement in the economy through economic liberalization and privatization and maintenance of proper balance and coordination among economic growth rate, availability of resources and other macro variables.
"
10760,"On the basis of an extensive evaluation of the alternative investment programmes and policies to be adopted by the plan, it is estimated that a 5.1 percent average annual growth rate will be achieved during the Eighth Plan period (table 1).
"
10761,"The average long term growth rate in domestic product was merely 3 percent and this was responsible for the lack of growth in per capital inco me.
"
10762,"In view if the disappointing state if the per capital income and the increase in poverty, it has become imperative to achieve higher economic growth rate for the amelioration of the standard of living of the common people.
"
10763,"Although this growth rate would seem ambitious in the light of past experiences, it will be possible to achieve the above mentioned growth rate in the new political and economic environment.
"
10764,"The appropriate utilization of the existing infrastructure of the economy will also contribute to the increase in the growth rate of gross domestic product.
"
10765,"Similarly, the prospective growth in the rate of private savings and the curtailment of unproductive government spending will provide additional help in increasing the economic growth rate.
"
10766,"Furthermore, the achievement of the above growth rate alone will ensure additional advantages to the economy and provide a sound basis for further accelerated economic growth rate and an increase in additional employment opportunities in future.
"
10767,"The estimated growth rate of the eighth plan con not be considered unduly high in comparison with the high growth rates achieved by developing nations through economic liberalization.
"
10768,"The appropriate allocations and utilization of resources, economic liberalization and other policy reforms will contribute further towards the attainment of the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent in the Eighth plan period.
"
10769,"On the assumption that the rate of population growth will be 2.1 percent during the plan period, the above economic growth rate will result in a three -fold increase over previous per-capita growth rates or a three percent annual growth in per capital income.
"
10770,"During the plan period, the above economic growth rate will be achieved by increasing productivity, by exercising greater discipline in government expenditure, and by implementing policy reforms which will attract the private sector investment in the fields of industry, trade, finance and sp on.
"
10771,"An analysis conducted on the basis of the current extent of available foreign aid indicates that extensive improvements in work performance and considerable increase in domestic savings must be achieved in order to further increase the economic growth rate.
"
10772,"Although foreign debts can substitute for the difference between investment and savings, they may have adverse effect on the payment of principal and interest and inflation.
"
10773,"The above growth rate also appears to be an appropriate proposition on the basis of the capabilities of the economy and the uncertainties as to the mode of implementation of economic liberalization by the countries with which there are regional trade relations.
"
10774,"In order the achieve the targeted value added growth rate in the Eighth plan period, a 5.1 percent growth rate in the gross domestic product will be achieved by means of a 3.7 percent increase in agricultural value added and a 6.1 percent increase in non-agricultural value added.
"
10775,"The higher non-agricultural value added in comparison to the agricultural one will lead to structural changes in the economic by the final year of the plan.
"
10776,"As shown in table 1, the share of non -agricultural sector will rise from 44.5 percent in 1991/92 to 47.3 percent in 1996/97.
"
10777,"Although the gr owth rate which appears in the structure of domestic product will be only marginal and the agricultural sector continues to hold the major share up to the end of the plan period, these changes will certainly contribute to the creation of new employment opportunities and an accelerated growth in the non-agricultural production.
"
10778,"The estimated economic growth rates indicate a progressive upward trend in the rate of growth in the economy.
"
10779,"Total investment Requirement for the plan period and sectoral Allocation of Resources:
"
10780,"As mentioned above, the size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns, growth in productivity, the control in government expenditure and the policies encouraging the diversion of private sector savings to productive sectors will contribute to the attainment of a 5.1 percent economic growth rate.
"
10781,"The estimated sectoral allocation of investment is based on a detailed analysis of existing and potential capit al productivity in eight major sectors of economy.
"
10782,"Compared to the seventh plan, a slight increase is proposed in the sectoral shares of investment in agriculture, irrigation, forestry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services.
"
10783,"There are three fundamental grounds for the proposed investment  pattern.
"
10784,"Firstly, the selection of appropriate projects and new policies of evaluation will give rise to increased efficiency in various sectors.
"
10785,"The national planning commission will have to play a significant role in the upgrading of such efficiency.
"
10786,"The application of new policies and methods of the selection of projects and evaluation, in particular, will result in economy in investment, and the investment units in various sectors will help the growth of production in those areas.
"
10787,"Secondly, the policy of economic liberalization will direct the flow of resources to productive sectors such as agriculture, industry, trade and tourism.
"
10788,"Thus, the share of industrial sector in total investment will rise to an average of 8.8 percent in the Eighth plan from the 7.7 percent average of the seventh plan.
"
10789,"Similarly, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry will increase to 25.8 percent for 24.5 and this increase will have been made possible mainly by the development programmes related to rural development.
"
10790,"Thirdly, as the Eighth Plan lays special emphasis on rural development, there will be a considerable increase in people’s participation and the contribution of labour.
"
10791,"Therefore, in spite of the lack of larger financial investment, there will be a higher generation of capital in these sectors.
"
10792,"The total gross investment outlay for the eighth Plan period is estimated to be Rs 170,332 million (Table2).
"
10793,"This estimate is based on the assumption that there will be an improvement over the past incremental capital output ration of 4.5:1 to 4.3:1. the incremental capital output ration is estimated to be as decline because of the projected better results of expenditures in governmental sectors to be made possible by the policy of economic liberalization in the private sector, and appropriate selection of projects, budget, expenditure, management and monitoring systems.
"
10794,"As shown in Table 2, the share of agriculture, irrigation and forestry in total investment will reach 25.8 percent.
"
10795,"Similarly, compared to the seventh Plan, the investment share of industry, trade, hotel and restaurants and social services will also increase in the eight plan.
"
10796,"The proposed size of total investment and its sectoral allocation patterns will primarily contribute to the increase in the aggregate and secotral production growth rates.
"
10797,"Similarly, the growth of efficiency in some sectors, too, will cause a marginal decline in the incremental capital output ratio.
"
10798,"Out of the total gross fixed investment of Rs 170,332 million, Rs 109,193 million (64.1 Percent) will be invested by the private sector while the remaining Rs 61,139 million (55.9 Percent) will be invested by the government sector (table3). In the seventh plan the amount of total investment stood at Rs 103, 014 million at 1991/92 prices.
"
10799,"Thus, compared to the seventh plan, investment during the eighth plan period will have to be increased by 10.6 percent per annum.
"
10800,"Although this rate appears to be fairly high compared to that of other least developed nations, considering that the Eighth plan has been initiated at a time when there in a limited capital base, it will be possible to increase the investment at the above mentioned rate.
"
10801,"The new environment created by liberal economic policies will also promote the increase of the investment growth rate.
"
10802,"In the seventh plan, the share of government sector stood at 41 percent of gross fixed investment, which will come down to 35.9 percent in the Eighth plan.
"
10803,"Thus, the share of the private sector investment is estimated to reach 64.1 of gross fixed investment during the Eighth plan period.
"
10804,"As shown in Talbe 4, of the total development outlay of 113,479 million, social services and agriculture, irrigation and forestry sectors will receive a higher share of the total development outlay (31.5 and 25.7 percent respectively) followed by electricity (20.9 percent) and transport and communications (17.7 percent).
"
10805,"A detailed sectoral breakdown of the total development outlay is presented in table 5. the differences in the shares of sectoral gross fixed investment in total development outlay are caused by the differences in the nature of the programmes proposed in various sectors.
"
10806,"Sources of Investment
"
10807,"Out of the total fixed capital investment of Rs 170,323 million, 56.3 percent (Rs 95,977 million) will be borne thought national savings.
"
10808,"Of the remaining 43.7 percent (Rs74,355 million) 26.6 percent (Rs 19,761 million) will be financed through foreign grants and 73.4 percent (Rs 54,594 million) through external loans.
"
10809,"From the table, it clearly appears that ins spite of high priority accorded to private sector investment, the private sector’s savings in likely to exceed its investment amount.
"
10810,"However, despite the reduced investment, there may be considerable negative savings accumulation in the public sector. The expansion of the public sector and the uncontrolled inclusion of numerous projects during the panchayat regime have led to the continuity of an expenditure burden in the initial years of the eighth plan entailing a continued increase in government expenditure and negative savings.
"
10811,"The almost unsustainable upward trend in negative savings appears to have gained impetus during the last decade of the panchayat regime and the main contributing factor for this is a great increase in the unproductive and consumption expenditure of the public sector.
"
10812,"Although the size of negative savings is expected to reduce towards the end of the plan upon gradual improvements over the budgeting and accounting systems used in regular and development budgets, it will take a number of years to make the public sector capable of generating savings.
"
10813,"As shown in table6, the negative savings during the Eighth plan will be, more or less, equivalent to 34.5 percent of the gross fixed capital investment of the public sector.
"
10814,"At the economic growth rate of 5.1 percent, the government revenue will increase by 9.7 percent, but the share of negative savings will continue to be high due to its increasing trend in the past.
"
10815,"The deficit between the public sector negative savings and investment will be borne thorough foreign assistance and internal borrowing.
"
10816,"Internal loans will primarily be arranged from private sector saving, which will facilitate the control of money supply and price level.
"
10817,"A little different picture emerges when the level of development outlay and sources of financing are analyzed.
"
10818,"As shown in table 7, during the Eighth plan, the share of revenue surplus in development outlay will remain 27.5 percent and the share of foreign aid will be maintained at 65.5 percent.
"
10819,"Only 7,5 percent will be borne through internal borrowing.
"
10820,"Thus the extent of deficit financing will be much lower in this plan than in the previous plans.
"
10821,"Macroeconomic Impact of total and Sectoral Investment
"
10822,"The reallocation in sectoral investment and economy in resource utilization, accompanied by liberal economic policies, will not only help achieve higher growth rates but also increase employment opportunities and maintain economic stability during the plan Period.
"
10823,"Besides, the creation of a favorable environment for private sector will also stimulate growth in domestic savings.
"
10824,"As shown in table 8, gross domestic savings will rise from 9.5% of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.5 percent of gross domestic product by the end of the plan period in 1996/97. the deficit finance will be reduced from 1.7 percent of the gross domestic product in 1991/92 to less than one percent of GDP by the end of the Eight plan.
"
10825,"Similarly, the current account deficit will also be reduced from 9.6 percent of gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 8.0 percent in 1996/97.
"
10826,"The share of government consumption is expected to increase only moderately from 11.5 percent of the  gross domestic product in 1991/92 to 12.6 percent of the gross domestic product in 1996/97.
"
10827,"The increase in money supply during the plan period will be lim ited to 12.1 percent per annum, which will help in limiting inflation to about 9 percent.
"
10828,"The policy and structural reforms to be adopted during the plan period do not permit any great reduction in the average rate of inflation.
"
10829,"However, since these reforms will help achieve stability in the economy, they will facilitate the task of reducing the rate of inflation in the years to come. During the eighth plan period, the rate of inflation will be maintained below 9 percent in average by reducing the increasing liquidity of the economy and by adopting other appropriate monetary and fiscal policy measures.
"
10830,"Manpower demand during the plan period will record a growth at the rate of 3.1 percent per annum.
"
10831,"This increase in manpower demand in expected to take place as a result of the increase in investment in different sectors of the economy and the subsequent rise in value added.
"
10832,"The increased demand in the labour force during the eighth plan period is expected to reach over 1.4 million jobs.
"
10833,"Thus, the macroeconomic implications of total and sectoral investment outlay indicate that, provided the proposed policies and programmes are effectively implemented in time, they will be able to contribute in constantly raising the economic growth rate, maintaining economic stability and alleviating poverty through the extension of employment opportunities.
"
10834,"In the pas t, the Nepalese economy remained considerably weak in matters of achieving higher economic growth rate and maintaining stability.
"
10835,"The declining productivity in the government sectors, the reduction in the share of domestic savings in gross domestic product and the flow of a major share of total private sector investment towards unproductive capital sector such as real estate also have created several problems in the economy. Estate also has created several problems in the economy.
"
10836,"Therefore, in order to raise the productivity of the government sector, special emphasis will have to be given on the method of selecting appropriate projects, appropriate pricing policy, reformative institutionalized systems of monitoring and evaluation and the privatization of government undertakings.
"
10837,"It is necessary to promote productive investment policies which encourage the private sector to save and to direct their investment from the unproductive sector like real estate to the sectors capable of achieving higher economic growth rate such as industry.
"
10838,"The emphasis on efficient and economic-growth oriented sectors and the subsequent desirable structural changes in the eighth plan will provide considerable advantages to the economy during and even after the eighth plan period.
"
10839,"A s the returns from investment take long time to materialize, the policy reforms and the structural changes in the eighth plan are confidently expected to increase the work-performance of the economy particularly in the later years of the plan and thereafter.
"
10840,"Estimates of Development Materials Following is the estimated requirement of construction and development materials during the plan period for development programmes to be implemented during the Eighth plan.
"
10841,"Cement:
"
10842,"It is estimated that in order to undertake of iron rode, sections, channels, corrugated and ordinary roofing sheets in expected to be 669,000 metric tons during the Eighth plan period.
"
10843,"Although the total installed capacity of the industries producing these materials is 229, 000 metric tons per annum, they are found to be operating at only 25 percent of their installed capacity. Bricks:
"
10844,"An estimated requirement of 8,800 million bricks for the eighth plan is exp ected to be met by the production of the industries in the public as well as private sectors.
"
10845,"Timber: Timer is used in industries, construction work and for fuel wood.
"
10846,"It is estimated that government agencies will be able to supply a total of 15,850 million cubic feet of timber of different types during the plan period.
"
10847,"Polythene pipes: In view if the policy of expanding drinking water facilities, there will be an increase in the use of polythene pipes in the plan period.
"
10848,"Accordingly, 17,000 metric tons of polythene pipes are estimated to be put into use during this plan period.
"
10849,"Chemical Fertilizers:
"
10850,"The requirement of chemical fertilizers for the Eighth plan is estimated to be 916,000 metric tons the total requirement of chemical fertilizers in the country is being met through import.
"
10851,"The items under mineral oils are petrol, diesel, kerosene oil, aviation fuel, light diesel oil, furnace oil, L.P. gas, and bitumen etc.
"
10852,"A project has been initiated in view of the natural gas deposits found at different places in the Kathmandu valley.
"
10853,"Coke and Coal: The estimated consumption of coke and coal for the eighth plan is 1,113,000 metric tons, which is expected to be met through import.
"
10854,"Writing and printing paper: The consumption of writing and printing paper during the eighth plan is estimated to be 121,000 metric tons. out of this requirement, 21 percent only is expected to be met through the production of Bhrikuti paper factory and Everest paper mills.
"
10855,"News print: During the Eighth plan period, the demand for newsprint in estimated to be 18,000 metric tons the entire demand is expected to be met through import.
"
10856,"Explosives: The estimated demand for explosives during the eighth plan period is 1,400 metric tons.
"
10857,"Irrigation plays a key role in the development of agricultural sector which has remained the backbone of the country's economy.
"
10858,"Although agriculture sector contributes the most to gross national production, the development in irrigation has been less than expected.
"
10859,"The agriculture sector has still to rely largely on rainfall.
"
10860,"Frequent drought and excessive rain have hampered the actual growth of agricultural reduction on one and, while on the other, the rapid population growth has led to a situation of food import for meeting the growing demand.
"
10861,"In this context, it has become essential to emphasize on the irrigation development for increased agricultural production from the limited 1and with the use of surface and groundwater resources available in the country.
"
10862,"While planning for irrigation development, it is also necessary to maintain co-ordination between irrigation and agricultural production programmes towards achieving maximum benefit.
"
10863,"It has also become important to entrust full responsibility of the operation and management of irrigation systems to user farmers after soliciting their organised participation in the identification, feasibility studies, selection and implementation of irrigation systems.
"
10864,"Progress during the Seventh Plan:
"
10865,"Department of Irrigation and Agriculture Development Bank have together developed irrigation facilities in 179,337 ha of land during the Seventh Plan period.
"
10866,"Similarly, an additional 48,337 ha has been developed during the two years interim period of FY 1990/1991 and 1991/1992.
"
10867,"It is estimated that a tota1 of 598,804 ha of land will have received irrigation facility by t he end of FY 1991/1 92.Fu11 detail are given in Table 1.
"
10868,"Existing Problems:
"
10869,"Construction work of big projects planned to provide irrigation facility to large areas not being completed in time and completed projects not operating in full capacity.
"
10870,"6. Inadequate participation of Nongovernmental Organisations and the private sectors in the implementation of irrigation projects.
"
10871,"7. Farmer's inability to derive expected benefits from the project s due to project implementing government agency's lack of direct accountability towards the people.
"
10872,"8. Unsustainability of the projects due to the lack of necessary attention towards the institutional aspects during the execution of the programme by the government agency.
"
10873,"Considering the above problems, necessary measures will be taken to complete the irrigation projects within the allocated time during the Eighth Plan period.
"
10874,"Priority will be given to the construction of low-cost projects for their sustained operation through maximum mobilisation of available resources with the participation of government and semi-government organisations and private and non-government sector .
"
10875,"Adequate measures will be effected in the promotion and extension of appropriate technology including irrigation management improvement.
"
10876,"Background of the Eighth Plan:
"
10877,"Development and expansionu of irrigation facilities is essential for increasing agricultural production required to ensure economic growth and security in food supply.
"
10878,"In spite of huge past investment made in this sector, farming still depends, to a large extent, on rainfa11 .
"
10879,"Furthermore, even the completed projects have not been possible to be fully utilised.
"
10880,"Every year,there is a need to make huge investment on the repair, maintenance and operation of large projects.
"
10881,"But these projects have not enable to provide irrigation facilities to the farmers on time. Besides, in the context of large under construction now being cost ineffective from financial perspective, doubt has been raised about the validity of their implementation.
"
10882,"The very name ""irrigation"" has appeared to be synonymous with a viscious cycle of construction, non-operation and again reconstruction.
"
10883,"Such a state of counterproductive investments in irrigation sector is sure to make a negative impact on the national economy.
"
10884,"Because of the fact that most of the small irrigation systems are operate by farmers, it seems desirable to pay special attention to such projects as can be managed and operated by themselves. The costs per hectare of some of the government constructed projects are found to range from Re. 60,000 to Re 100,000 or more.
"
10885,"Also observed are the costs per hectare of projects constructed with the participate on of farmers to be ranging from Re. 8,000 to Rs 25,000.
"
10886,"The latter seem be sustainable as repair, maintenance and operation works in such projects are carried out by the users themselves.
"
10887,"Climatological conditions vary across different parts of the country due to the country's physiographic.
"
10888,"It has, therefore, become very essential to maintain co-ordination between the choice of crops and the provision of irrigation facility.
"
10889,"In the same vein, it is necessary to develop and extend small irrigation systems that conform to the country's physiographic and cause minimum adverse impact on the environment. objective:
"
10890,"Irigation projects in the Eighth Plan will be implemented to achieve the following objectives:
"
10891,"1. To increase agricultural production using appropriate irrigation technologies suited to varying geo-physical and climatic conditions of the country and that cause minimum negative impact on the environment.
"
10892,"2. To increase agricultural production and productivity by improving the man agreement of existing irrigation systems to bring about increased reliability in irrigation management.
"
10893,"3. To provide maximum irrigation facility by implementing financially, technically and environmentally sustainable and cost effective projects with farmers participation.
"
10894,"To achieve the aforementioned objectives, development and extension of irrigation facilities will be undertaken on the basis of following priorities:
"
10895,"1. Projects costing less per hectare and projects requiring minimum government involvement in repair and maintenance.
"
10896,"2. Projects guaranteeing high people's participation; projects that can be implemented, operated and maintained by users themselves; and projects requiring minimum government investment.
"
10897,"3. Projects more likely to benefit small farmers and backward communities.
"
10898,"4. Projects yielding quick returns.
"
10899,"5. Projects constructed in the past which now remain non-operational and can be rehabilitated at low cost with the organised participation of farmers.
"
10900,"6. Multipurpose projects of national importance.
"
10901,"7. Irrigation projects in under-construction stage.
"
10902,"Policies:
"
10903,"Following Policies will be pursued for achieving the irrigation targets set:
"
10904,"1. Projects with less cost per hectare will be selected after the survey of potential projects requested by the farmer.
"
10905,"While planning any irrigation project, users will be involved in every step right from project initiation.
"
10906,"Same procedure will be followed for repair and maintenance as well.
"
10907,"2. Public communication means will be used while implementing the programme with a view to provide equa1 opportunity to all for participation.
"
10908,"3. Additional investment in projects under construction stage for many years and those with high cost per hectare will be made only after their thorough re evaluation.
"
10909,"7. Joint management system will be applied for involving the users in the management of multipurpose, large an medium projects with special emphasis given on irrigation management training institutional development at the farmers' level and access to technical services.
"
10910,"8. Encouragement will be given for the operation of government constructed project s commanding over 2,000 ha in the Terai and 500 ha in the Hills under the joint management of the responsible government agency and the users' committee.
"
10911,"Conjunctive use of groundwater will be encouraged to be used in areas not irrigable round the year by surface system only.
"
10912,"Construction expenses of small and medium projects will be jointly borne by His Majesty's Government and the users.
"
10913,"Lift irrigation powered by electricity, bio-gas and wind wi11 be encouraged where feasible power in order to reduce dependence on imported fuel. 14.
"
10914,"The users associations and committees will be mandatorily involved in the co, lection of water fees in order to instill self-reliance in projects to be operated at the government level and under joint management.
"
10915,"Water cess will be levied only when services are actually provided to the farmers. 16.
"
10916,"Priority will be given to the installation of shallow tubewell s in areas where shallow aquifers exist.
"
10917,"The insta11 at, on of the tubewells will be gradually be transferred from the government to the private sector.
"
10918,"Ground water exploration, feasibility study and monitoring in will be carried out on a priority basis.
"
10919,"Arrangements wi11 be made to avai1 information relating to groundwater to concerned District Development Committees, District Irrigation offices and other agencies. 17 	Feasibility study reports prepared to date will be made available to the District Irrigation Office and the indices of such reports will be made available to the concerned District Development Committee and users ' committees.
"
10920,"Sprinkler irrigation will be encouraged in the hilly region in an extensive manner on the basis of feasibility - Where feasible, lift irrigation schemes will be operated by electricity available from the small hydroe1ectric project.
"
10921,"While executing the small irrigation projects, the concerned agency will have to explain clearly about cash voluntary labour and repair and maintenance expenses to be borne by the users ' committee, and should execute the project after getting written agreement from them on these provisions, Construction expenses of the project will be operated by joint signature of the person nominated by the users’ committee and the technical representative of the executing agency.
"
10922,"It will be mandatory to get the decision of the user's committee if any part of the project needs to be awarded to a contractor.
"
10923,"Arrangements will be made to keep the records of expenditure in clear and transparent manner at all levels. 20.
"
10924,"Irrigation programme will be implemented in accordance with Irrigation Policy 1992"", High priority has been given to peoples' participation in the Eighth Plan.
"
10925,"Arrangements will be made to clearly determine people’s participation while implementing any project.
"
10926,"When implementing any project , a fixed sum of money will be borne by His Majesty's Government and the rest by the users' committee.
"
10927,"Specified management expenses will be made available to be implemented in order solicit increased participation of the semi-governmental organisation, the non-governmental association/ organisation and the private agency.
"
10928,"The role of the non-governmental organisation, the private sector and the users has remained minimum at present in the process of deve1opingthe 	irrigation 	sector.
"
10929,"Research 	on promotion and extension of the irrigation technology will be initiated during the plan period to implement the irrigation project through the nongovernmental organization, private entrepreneurs and the users also in areas where service cannot be rendered, according to the demand of the farmers due to the institutional problems of the government and semi government agencies.
"
10930,"22.
"
10931,"For this purpose, the non -governmental organisation, the private enterprise firm and the users committee registered at national or district level will be encouraged to get involved in the development of the irrigation sector.
"
10932,"Research, promotion and extension of the irrigation technology will be carried out through the government and semi-government organisations. Target and Programme:
"
10933,"The total, physical target of the under construction project included in the plan period is 135,250 ha of which  120,690 ha, will receive irrigation facility by FY 1996/97.
"
10934,"The proposed w projects with a total physical target of 81,400 ha to be initiated during the plan period will be implemented with a view to provide irrigation facility to 39,292 ha of land within the plan period.
"
10935,"Similarly, an additional 1,150 ha will be irrigated through feasible and continuing projects. The irrigation programme to be implemented by the Agriculture Development Bank will command 119,700 ha.
"
10936,"Besides this, a total of 13,063 ha will receive irrigation facility by he projects be implemented through the non -governmenta1 organisation and the private sector. in this way, the total area to be irrigated from the new and continuing projects during the p Ian period will be about 293,895 ha.
"
10937,"Irrigation facility will be made available to 132,763 ha of land from the irrigation projects of short gestation.
"
10938,"Irrigation facility will be available to 52,650 ha of land from the medium and small irrigation projects (ILC and ISP).
"
10939,"Irrigation facility will be available to 108,482 ha and 185,413 ha of land respectively from the large and the small irrigation project.
"
10940,"Additional irrigation facility will be available to 293,895 ha. f land during the plan period from different sources – the surface, the underground and the unidentifiable sources contributing 204,955; 87,790 and 1,150 hectares respectively. The total irrigated area will thus reach 892,699 ha by the end of the plan period.
"
10941,"In order to achieve the aforementioned target, the following programmes will be implemented:
"
10942,"Sunsari Morang Irrigation Project (Second Phase):
"
10943,"Though initially targeted to provide irrigation facility to 66,000 ha of land in Sunsari and Morang districts, this project is providing partial irrigation facility to only 20,000 ha due to lack of command area development various other technical problems.

"
11091,"Energy
"
11092,"Introduction:
"
11093,"The prosperity of any country can be gauged by the per capita energy consumption of that country as a direct positive relation is noticed between the two.
"
11094,"Although per capita consumption of energy in Nepal is extremely low compared to other countries, the annual import bill of petroleum products, comprising only four percent of the energy consumption, claims as high as 40 percent of annual earnings from export.
"
11095,"Solar energy is without doubt the main source of energy of the lithospher e, but the process of converting the solar energy into electricity and other kinds of energy in order to meet the need of modern industry, transport, household and others in general, has been found to be very costly.
"
11096,"Therefore, the desperate current need is to meet the constantly increasing energy requirement through the proper development and mobilization of main energy resources like forest, bio -mass and hydropower existing in the country.
"
11097,"The energy sector program in the Eighth Plan has fully considered these realities.
"
11098,"Progress during the Seventh Plan Period and the Period without Plan:
"
11099,"The progress in the electricity sector and alternative sources of energy during the Seventh Plan (1985-1990) and the interim period (1991-1992) was as follows: 7,544 In addition to the progress shown above, preliminary studies relating to feasibility and detailed engineering designs of Upper Karnali (240 MW), Upper Arun (350 MW), Bhote Kosi (48 MW) and Khimti Khola (60 MW) projects which can be implemented for future internal consumption and exports have been completed.
"
11100,"Feasibility studies of Arun-III, Upper Arun and West Seti hydro-elertric projects, have also been completed and represent economically attractive propositions. Also completed is the study of a prospective project of 10 MW capacity in the Jhimruk river for supplying electricity to the headquarters of some hill districts (Arghakhanchi, Gulmi, Pyuthan, Rolpa etc.) of the Western and Midwestern Development Regions.
"
11101,"A revision in the detailed engi neering study is underway to reduce the size of Arun-III project to 201 MW as warranted by the difficulty in obtaining necessary fund for the project of that capacity at present. Besides, detailed engineering study of the 100 MW Kaligandaki project is in progress following the arrangement of necessary fund from UNDP upon the updating of its feasibility study.
"
11102,"Regarding major hydroelectric projects with export potential, studies relating to detailed project preparation of the Karnali (Chisapani) high dam multipurpose project and necessary field survey works in order to carry out the feasibility study of the Mahakali (Pancheswar) multipurpose project in the international border have been completed.
"
11103,"Talks between officials of India and Nepal at various levels are in progress in order to implement these projects.
"
11104,"Works relating to increasing the capacity particularly of the existing Trishuli-Devighat hydropower stations from among the existing generating stations will be undertaken.
"
11105,"Existing Problems:
"
11106,"Commercial and traditional fuels have remained as two principal sources of national energy supply.
"
11107,"Hydropower in particular will be developed as a new commercial energy base for the country’s economic growth.
"
11108,"It is essential to pay special attention to the scientific management of the traditional energy sources in order to ensure its sustained use and also to maintain the environmental balance.
"
11109,"1. Excessive Reliance on Timber and Fuelwood:
"
11110,"It is evident that a sustainable supply of fuelwood can not be maintained from uncontrolled clearance of forests.
"
11111,"If this process of forest destruction is to continue, there will be a scarcity of fuelwood in the country in the very near future and additional environmental probkems of different sorts will also emerge.
"
11112,"Such a situation has arisen due to the failure to take effective steps towards scientific forest management.
"
11113,"Another principal reason for forest denudation is associated with the ownership of the forest.
"
11114,"The legal ownership and control of forest resources of the kingdom is vested exclusively with His Majesty’s Government.
"
11115,"In the context of the absence of any alternative to immediate and proper substitution for fuelwood, the transfer of forest ownership to the private and community sectors has remained the sole alternative for safeguarding the forest resources and meeting the fuelwood nee.
"
11116,"2. Substitution of Fuelwood by other Traditional Fuels:
"
11117,"The use of other fuels has been steadily increasing due to the short supply of fuelwood.
"
11118,"In the rural areas, an increased substitution of fuelwood by agricultural residues and cattle wastes has taken place.
"
11119,"This has adversely affected fertility of the cultivated land due to deficiency in organic manure.
"
11120,"In the urban areas, the rich community has started using the imported commercial fuels in place of fuelwood.
"
11121,"The proportion of population using electricity as fuel is, however, still very small.
"
11122,"Similarly, industries have started using agricultural residues and kerosene due to high price of fuelwood.
"
11123,"Commercial Fuel:
"
11124,"1. Electricity:
"
11125,"It is evident from the table in Appendix 2 that the gap between electricity demand and supply will continue to be wodened in the coming years.
"
11126,"Electricity supply compared to demand will be less from the coming Fiscal Year (1993/94). A monthly deficit has occurred even prior to this period.
"
11127,"In the coming couple of years, additional electricity demand by new industries is estimated to be 50 MW.
"
11128,"The principal problem in the energy sector is thus the imbalance between electricity demand and supply.
"
11129,"There are, however, other operating constraints as listed below; 1.
"
11130,"At present electrical energy is being made available at rates lesser than its actual cost.
"
11131,"This has made it difficult to attract the investment of the private sector in electricity generation.
"
11132,"2. The percentage of leakage is very high in the electric network due to technical and hosts of other reasons.
"
11133,"This has caused a negative impact on the operational and financial aspects. Besides, the burden of high electric tariff has fallen on the shoulders of consumers as well.
"
11134,"3. Problems arise at the time of maximum electricity demand due to failure of generation as per installed capacity from many of the currently operated power stations due to the lack of systematic repair and maintenance works.
"
11135,"4. The load factor of existing electricity distribution system is 48% only.
"
11136,"This seems to be less than the expected level.
"
11137,"The possibility of increasing the existing load factor through proper demand management is indicated.
"
11138,"5. It has not been possible to receive proper return out of the investment because of the imbalance between the investment on power generation and the creation of transmission network.
"
11139,"6. Analyzed from the point of number of employees in the power sector, power generation and annual sale per employee in Nepal seems to be the least of all countries in Asia.
"
11140,"7. It has not been possible to plan hydro-electric projects in a proper manner due to the lack of co-ordination among the agencies involved in the power sector.
"
11141,"8. There does not seem to have been an appropriate selection of hydro-electric projects in a systematic way due to ineffective reviewing technique applied to studies relating to hydro-electric projects and an inefficient selection process.
"
11142,"This has resulted in the lack of sufficient alternatives for implementation of the project.
"
11143,"9. It has not been possible to maintain continuity in the development of hydropower sector because of the inability to appoint concerned agencies themselves as the executing agency and make the Nepali technical agencies responsible and accountable for the project while conducting the study and mplementing the hydro-electric projects.
"
11144,"Imported Fuel:
"
11145,"The import of mineral oils and coal comprised 85% of the commercial fuel consumption in FY 1990/91.
"
11146,"While, in fact, the imported mineral oils and coal constituted 91% of the commercial fuel in 1985/86, this has now declined to 85%.
"
11147,"Forty percent of the income earned through export is thus spent on the import of petroleum fuel.
"
11148,"Inadequacy of Appropriate Programmes Relating to Alternative Energy:
"
11149,"It has not been possible to promote alternative energy sources like biogas, micro hydro, improved stove, solar water heater etc. at the desired level.
"
11150,"Government policies in this regard were not reliable in the past.
"
11151,"Though these technologies were publicized at the peoples’ level, they could not be brought into adequate practical use.
"
11152,"Constraints relating to Investment:
"
11153,"As regards investment, the power sector has been receiving the highest priority followed by the forestry sector. But the level of investment in the development of natural gas and alternative energy seems to be insignificant.
"
11154,"Also, the investment in forest, in reality, is not even sufficient for the supply of fuelwood.
"
11155,"An analysis of the expenditure statistics of the past decade reveals that the expenditure incurred in the power sector ranged from 63.2 percent to 87.5 percent of the expenditure incurred in the development of the entire energy sector.
"
11156,"The investment level in the power sector is expected to stay at the same level in the coming years as well.
"
11157,"It could have been possible to maintain the growth rate of the power sector at a higher level by mobilising economies of scale inherent in the larger projects.
"
11158,"This, however, entails a very high investment beyond the capacity of the present economy.
"
11159,"Implementation of large projects to date has been done with the mobilisation of the international consortium financing. Under this arrangement, there is a possibility of diseconomies of scale due to increased cost of the project because of the tied financing.
"
11160,"It is very difficult to obtain the entire investment requirement from a single donor institution in the development of large hydro-electric project as it requires heavy foreign investment.
"
11161,"It has not been possible to generate electricity at stipulated time and cost due to delay in the implementation of the project resulting from the lack of synchronized financing by multiple donors.
"
11162,"Background: Energy plays a key role in sustainable economic growth.
"
11163,"But national economic growth rate, availability of foreign investment, national investment capacity, demand and capacity of consumers to pay service charges have greatly influenced the decision on the fixation of priorities and investment levels towards energy demand and supply management.
"
11164,"There is a big gap between the energy demand and its sustainable supply.
"
11165,"But initial investment requirements are quite heavy in hydropower generation and distribution projects.
"
11166,"A review of energy use pattern in the past shows that the traditional means of energy such as wood, fuelwood, shows that the traditional means of energy such as wood, fuelwood, cowdung cakes, agricultural residues have occupied an important place in the supply of national energy.
"
11167,"While traditional energy has contributed 95% in the total energy consumption of the country, the contribution of hydropower is below 1%.
"
11168,"According to recent statistics, only 9% of the total population has access to electricity.
"
11169,"The main objective of the Eighth Plan is to provide economic justice to the backward community by increasing the national production.
"
11170,"In order to achieve this, it is essential to encourage the private sector in the promotion and diversification of agricultural and industrial production including improvement and expansion of the existing service sector.
"
11171,"In fact, it will not be an exaggeration to say that dynamism and diversification in agricultural and industrial sectors is possible only with the availability and effective use of energy at reasonable cost.
"
11172,"The role of energy in our economy is important both from the standpoint of domestic use and export.
"
11173,"The pace of industrialisation was sluggish in the past due to the shortage of energy despite sufficient bio and water energy resources in the country.
"
11174,"The pace of industrial development can not be accelerated until the obstacle of the availability of energy is removed.
"
11175,"Besides, hindrances may be faced in the growth in agricultural production due to shortage of energy in activities such as processing of agricultural produce and lift irrigation.
"
11176,"Enough support will also be provided in the development of food processing and cottage industry if water mills, diesel engine and biogas including micro hydro-power project can be promoted for meeting energy needs in the rural areas.
"
11177,"Sufficient benefit can be derived from the implementation of comparatively cheaper major hydro-electric projects of Nepal.
"
11178,"National production and productivity can be increased and foreign exchange can also be earned by exporting electricity, if effective hydropower projects and other sources of energy are developed and consolidated in a cost-effective manner.
"
11179,"In addition to this, the amount of foreign currency being spent in the import of mineral oils, which can be substituted by national energy, can be reduced.
"
11180,"All these facts tend to indicate that high priority has to be accorded to the development of energy.
"
11181,"Human resources and financial investment in large measure are necessary to meet the ever increasing demand for energy by developing the energy resources available in the country.
"
11182,"Programmes and strategies relating to energy have, therefore, been formulated so that they meet the national energy needs. Due consideration has been given to the present economic status of the country, the available technology and the national priority, too.
"
11183,"More than 70% of the total investment has been made for the development of different sectors of the economy from the government sector itself in the past.
"
11184,"But it has become essential for the benefit of the economy to abandon the tradition of only the government sector making such investment.
"
11185,"It is necessary to provide proper incentives to attract the investment of the private sector in the development of energy sector for increasing the national production capacity and mobilising the government resources as much as possible towards rural development.
"
11186,"Energy Demand Supply Balance:
"
11187,"Sector wise Energy Demand Status:
"
11188,"Total energy use by all sectors of the economy in FY 1990/91 was 268,700,000 GJ (Giga Joules), of which 93 percent was used by the domestic sector.
"
11189,"Of which 93 percent was used by the domestic sector.
"
11190,"Of the remaining energy, the industrial sector used 4 percent and transport, trade and other sectors used 3 percent.
"
11191,"Ninety-eight percent of the energy requirement of the domestic sector is being met by the, traditional energy sources.
"
11192,"Although the comp onent of the commercial energy is very low in the national energy consumption, 28 percent of the total commercial energy is used by the domestic sector alone.
"
11193,"The commercial energy consumption has increased at the rate of 10 percent per annum within the decade beginning FY 1980/81.
"
11194,"Sixty- six percent of the total requirement of the industrial sector is being met from the traditional energy and 8 percent from electricity.
"
11195,"The transport sector is mainly dependent upon petroleum fuels.
"
11196,"Use of petroleum fuels has been increasing at an average of 5 percent per annum.
"
11197,"Similarly, 70 percent of the total energy requirement of the trade sector is bein g met from the commercial fuel itself.
"
11198,"Contribution of electric energy to this sector has been 21 percent.
"
11199,"In the same way, about 95 percent of the commercial fuel requirement of the agricultural sector is being met from petroleum fuels and the rest from electric energy.
"
11200,"The annual rate of increase in consumption of the commercial fuel in the agricultural sector during the past decade has been limited to 8 percent.
"
11201,"It is evident that further intense growth is expected to take place in the consumption of commercial fuel in the coming years due to the diversification in the production of agriculture sector, development of tourist industry, expansion of industrialisation etc.
"
11202,"Because of the fact that the people in the rural areas have been receiving the traditional energy free of cost, it is but natural that the demand for such energy will be increasing in future.
"
11203,"Due to this, the environmental problem will still be grave because of accelerated forest clearance.
"
11204,"Present Energy supply status:
"
11205,"1. Electric Energy:
"
11206,"The installed hydropower generation capacity in the country has reached around 233 MW.
"
11207,"This is less than'0.3 percent of the total theoretical potential.
"
11208,"The generating capacity of small hydro and diesel power stations in the remote areas is 16 MW.
"
11209,"Additional 4.2 MW of hydropower has been made available from mid 1991 from the small hydro-electric projects with the generating capacity of 32.to 245 Kw.
"
11210,"An additional 2000 KW will be available from the three small hydroelectric projects now under construction.
"
11211,"The peak load of the nation had reached 190 MW in 1991/92.
"
11212,"The construction of Marsyangdi Hydro-electric Project (69 MW), Andhi Khola Hydro-electric Project (5.1 MW) and Small Hydroelectric Projects (1.59 MW) was completed during the interim years (1990-1992).
"
11213,"Besides, the construction of 197 km transmissi9n line has also been completed.
"
11214,"In addition to the aforementioned physical target, several studies have been completed including feasibility and detailed - engineering studies of projects that can be implemented for future internal consumption and export.
"
11215,"A brief description of the projects whose studies have been undertaken at various levels 15 given in Appendix 1.
"
11216,"Regarding major hydro-electric projects with export potential, studies relating to project preparation of the Karnali Chisapani) high dam multipurpose project and necessary works relating to site investigation in order to carry out the feasibility study of the Mahakali (Pancheswor) multipurpose project in the international border have been completed.
"
11217,"Talks among officials at different levels of India and Nepal have continued in order to implement these projects.
"
11218,"Micro hydroelectric projects have also been constructed in the private sector.
"
11219,"Total generation capacity of micro hydropower stations operated .in the private sector is estimated at 920 KW. The number of 'such micro hydropower station in the country is 91.
"
11220,"2. Fuelwood:
"
11221,"Most of the rural households are meeting their energy needs from fuelwood available in the nearby forest free of cost.
"
11222,"The urban households, on the other hand, meet part of their energy needs by buying fuelwood.
"
11223,"This amounts to less than 10% of the total national requirement.
"
11224,"In rural market centres of the hilly region, fuelwood is purchased by tea shops, restaurants and government employees while others meet their needs by collecting fuelwood from the forest.
"
11225,"The private traders sell fuelwood through depots and dealership in the urban areas and the Timber Corporation of Nepal (TCN) also sells a small portion of the total fuelwood transaction.
"
11226,"The dense forest area of the country has severely depleted due to 	unrestrictedforest clearance in the past. Forest denudation is estimated to have taken place at the rate of 2.1 percent per annum or 27,000 ha per year during the period beginning FY 1964/65 to FY 1978/79.
"
11227,"The total forest area lost by the country duri ng this period is estimated at 382,000 ha.
"
11228,"The total national yearly consumption of fuelwood is 11.7 million mt and the supply of fuelwood in the regions of midhills and the eastern Terai has started to dwindle. The problem has not yet seriously manifested in the Midwestern and Farwestern regions.
"
11229,"The professional woodcutters and the hill descendants are particularly found to be involved in the sale of fuelwood by illegal felling of .trees.
"
11230,"Besides, a lot of wood/fuelwoodis found traded by the households settled near the highways by collecting from the forest in the pretention of their domestic use.
"
11231,"In fact, this type of unauthorised cutting and selling has become off-farm employment to most villagers.
"
11232,"3. Other Forms of Bioenergy:
"
11233,"Agricultural residue and cattle waste predominate in other forms of bioenergy. The quantity of agricultural waste used in the form of fuel is estimated to be around 600,000 metric tons with straw content at 50%.
"
11234,"Besides, fuel requirement is being met from about 2.3 million mt of cow dung cakes.
"
11235,"4. Commercial Fuel:
"
11236,"In commercial fuel, mineral oil or petroleum products and anthracite coal are in most use.
"
11237,"Almost the entire demand of these products is met through import.
"
11238,"The share of petroleum products in the national energy consumption is 4 percent and its share in the total commercial fuel is 72 percent.
"
11239,"Supply Arrangement of Petroleum Products: Nepal oil Corporation has the monopoly to sell and distribute petroleum products within the country.
"
11240,"It purchases kerosene and diesel from the world market and has arranged to receive (motor spirit is commercially known as petroleum or gasoline) aviation fuel, LPG including different oil products in exchange by making the imported crude oil available to India.
"
11241,"This corporation has arranged to sell and distribute these products as necessary upon storing them in the stores of Kathmandu, Amlekhganj, Biratnagar, Bhairahawa, Nepalganj and Dhangadhi.
"
11242,"Supply Arrangement of Coal:
"
11243,"This responsibility has been entrusted to the Nepal Coal Mines Limited.
"
11244,"Depot off ices of this corporation have been set uP in Birgunj, .Biratnagar and Bhairahawa in order to store, sell and distribute coal in important places of the kingdom.
"
11245,".
"
11246,"5. Power Exchange Arrangement:
"
11247,"Power exchange has been limited to 20 MW due to insufficient existing interconnection network, though there is a provision to exchange power up to 50 MW with India under the existing power exchange arrangement between the two countries.
"
11248,"While Nepal has received electricity from India at some places near the Nepal-India border, Nepal also has made available electricity to India at some other places.
"
11249,"The country is in a favourable position to develop major multipurpose water resource projects for export.
"
11250,"In this connection, talks are being held to develop some bilateral and multilateral major water resource projects of multipurpose nature.
"
11251,"Internal Energy Resource: The composition of the energy source of Nepal is based on the admixture of traditional and commercial fuels (forest products, agricultural residue, cowdung, solar and electric power).
"
11252,"The country has the capacity to continuously produce the energy equivalent to 1,860 million Giga Joules (GJ) annually.
"
11253,"This figure is 50 times higher than the existing estimate of energy consumption.
"
11254,"The country can be self reliant in the energy sector provided the existing energy resources are properly utilized.
"
11255,"It will not be an exaggeration to say that hydropower occupies a special position as 79 percent of the energy supply can be made available from this source.
"
11256,"It is estimated that Nepal has a theoretical hydropower potential of 83,000 MW on the basis of the analysis of river flows.
"
11257,"Of this, about 42,000 MW can be generated on the basis of economic feasibility studies carried out to date.
"
11258,"Studies have proven the existence of sufficient opportunities to develop multipurpose water resource projects with the construction of high dams due to its hill topography.
"
11259,"On the basis of studies carried out to date, the hydro-electric projects exceeding 10 MW are 93 in number.
"
11260,"In 30 of these projects, there is a possibility of constructing high dam.
"
11261,"2. Fuelwood:
"
11262,"It is estimated that about 8.85 million ha of land in Nepal can be developed into productive forests.
"
11263,"At present, 6.73 million ha of the country's land is estimated to be covered by forest and shrubs.
"
11264,"Fuelwood is being collected from 50 percent or 3.34 million ha of the area covered by forest and bushes.
"
11265,"It is estimated that 5.7 million mt of fuelwood per year can be met in a sustainable manner from this forest area.
"
11266,"Objective:
"
11267,"1. To integrate the national, productive sector as much as possible with the internally available energy and make the count ry more self-reliant by reducing the production cost of energy.
"
11268,"2. To gradually replace the imported energy with them obilisation of local source by especially emphasising on the proper development of different sources of energy available in the country.
"
11269,"3. To develop and utilise energy in such a way that it does not adversely affect the environment.
"
11270,"National Energy strategy:
"
11271,"Works will be undertaken for the promotion of technology for increased efficiency in scientific management and energy consumption from forest and other big significant sources at the community level with the objective of meeting the traditional demand and supply of energy.
"
11272,"It is necessary for this work to be done through the forest users group.
"
11273,"Regarding the commercial fuel, appropriate policy measures will be taken for the creation of environment conducive to gradually proceed towards self-reliance and conservation of energy.
"
11274,"Special priority will be given to the substitution of imported energy by locally, available energy sources in order to solve the problem of balance of payment.
"
11275,"The hydropower programmes will be tied up with irrigation, road and energy intensive industrial programmes requiring cheap energy.
"
11276,"It is essential to mobilise investment from within the power sector in order to provide continuity to the development of the power sector.
"
11277,"For this purpose, such projects will be selected which are capable of generating maximum profit and mobilising the possible savings.
"
11278,"Keeping the aforementioned facts in view, following strategies will be pursued during the Eighth Plan: 1.
"
11279,"Suitable steps will be taken to develop local energy sources in order to bring about sustainability in the national energy consumption keeping in view the technical and economic feasibility.
"
11280,"2. Management of energy consumption of the economically active productive sector and various other means of energy conservation will be adopted with proper study of the sensitivity of the environmental aspects as well.
"
11281,"3. Necessary arrangements will be made to involve bot h the government and non-government sectors for investment in large, medium and small power projects.
"
11282,"Besides, diverse commercial and financial sources will be mobilised.
"
11283,"4. Shortfall in the supply of energy in the short term and long term will be fulfilled from import only in case it can not be met domestically.
"
11284,"Agreements relating to the power exchange will be entered into in the best interest of the country with a view to achieving maximum benefit.
"
11285,"5. Social norms and values will be kept in mind while fi xing the price of all types of fuels in all cases except in those where the objective of the national development policy may be adversely affected.
"
11286,"6. Concerned agencies will be activated to control environmental problems related to energy supply and use.
"
11287,"A balance will be struck in the development of energy, and conservation and promotion of environment.
"
11288,"7. The possibility of transferring the ownership of government institutions involved in power distribution and generation to the private sector will be looked into in consonance with the privatisation policy.
"
11289,"Necessary support will be provided to RECAST, Engineering Institute, Biogas Company and similar other industries in generating1 energy, manufacturing utility equipment and undertaking research for the development of appropriate and safe energy technology at minimum cost statistics and information related to energy at the government level will be brought to the notice of general public through educational institutions, mass communication and special programmes, like site exhibition.
"
11290,"Energy policy:
"
11291,"An energy Master Plan will be formulated by determining long term policies and identifying appropriate institutional structure necessary for managing the demand and supply in the energy sector.
"
11292,"The Master Plan will pay particular attention to identifying ways of institutional change especially in the power sector because of the necessity to accord top priority to the study of institutional reforms within the field of commercial fuels.
"
11293,"The energy policy during the Eighth Plan will be 9s follows:
"
11294,"1. The Perspective Energy Plan will be used especially in the hydropower sector in order to know hydropower project of different capacities so that an adequate number of projects of various capacities are available for financing feasibility studies.
"
11295,"2. An export oriented strategy will be adopted with regard to power generation from large hydropower projects.
"
11296,"This will earn foreign currency needed for development. Maximum bilateral and multilateral cooperation will be mobilised for developing such projects.
"
11297,"3. The development of medium hydropower projects will be promoted by integrating it with the development of energy-intensive industries having comparative advantages.
"
11298,"4. External, internal and joint collaboration with the private sector will be promoted in the development and financing of medium and small scale hydropower projects.
"
11299,"Besides, legal and institutional arrangements providing support to exchange and pricing of power will be formulated and implemented.
"
11300,"5. The hydropower sector will be integrated with the irrigation programme.
"
11301,"Similarly, industries operating during off-peak hours will be provided electricity at concessional rates.
"
11302,"6. Programmes relating to growth of forest resource products will be implemented throu gh the users group in order to maintain continuity in the supply of traditional energy. The private sector will be encouraged in the afforestration programme by making available forest land in lease.
"
11303,"7. The management of energy demand regularises the energy need of the urban areas. Price fixation of different sources of energy should reflect the social investment.
"
11304,"Therefore} the household will be motivated to pursue energy efficient ways and devices.
"
11305,"Appropriate and complementary import policies will be formulated for supplying energy necessary for transport equipment and machineries.
"
11306,"8. Requirement of fuelwood and petroleum products of the industrial, commercial and transport sectors will be gradually replaced by electricity generated locally.
"
11307,"It will be encouraged to replace the imported fuel by electricity to a practicable extent.
"
11308,"9. Promotion of renewable energy technologies will be encouraged in order to reduce the current dependence on traditional and imported fuels.
"
11309,"The private sector will be encourage d to work towards techno bogy transfer, adoptive research and development, indigenisation of hydropower biomass and other renewable energy sectors.
"
11310,"Energy demand in the rural areas will be met in a decentralised manner through locally developed technology rand devices (cross flow turbines, induction generators and gasifiers).
"
11311,"10. Incentives will be provided to import energy efficient machine and parts of different types used in the industrial and other sectors, other electrically operated devices and kerosene stoves.
"
11312,"11. The use of vehicles consuming more fuel will be discouraged by providing incentives for operating public transport vehicles capable of carrying, a large number of passengers.
"
11313,"Consumption of imported fuel will be reduced by cutting down the number of government vehicles and disc9uraging liberal import of vehicles. 12.
"
11314,"Some joint venture and technology promotion institutions will be set up with a view to providing support to manufacture energy related equipment. Arrangements will be made for providing the judicial and legal  services, defining royalty and patent services procedures, etc. for these institutions.
"
11315,"Hydropower Policy:
"
11316,"1. Hydroelectric, projects will be formulated on the - basis of demand and priority will be given to the implementation of projects with less per unit production cost and capable of generating comparatively higher economic returns.

"
11326,"1.10 Electricity supply will be increased to provide sufficient energy available to the people and electricity tariff rate will be made more practical.
"
11327,"2. Following policies have been formulated, in order to encourage the involvement of the local autonomous bodies and _he private sector (national and foreign) in electricity generation, transmission and distribution works.
"
11328,"2.1 	No license will be required for the hydroelectric project with up to 100 KW capacities.

"
11363,"2.28 	The electric power generated from the hydropower station of the private sector may be sold or purchased by mutual understanding between the private producer and the NEA.
"
11364,"3. There has been a predominance of a limited number of products (Woolen carpets, readymade garments, handicrafts and leather) in export to a limited market.
"
11365,"Among these products, too, while the quality standards of woolen carpets have not ameliorated and at the same time the industrial base of readymade garments has not acquired stability.
"
11366,"Due to the lack of productwise and countrywise diversification of these items, problems have cropped up with regard to their sustainability.
"
11367,"4. Although the deficit in trade with third countries is on the decline, the trade deficit with India has been rising due to an excessive increase in import and stagnation in export.
"
11368,"5. Potentially exportable products, although identified to a certain extent have not yet been efficiently selected and developed.
"
11369,"6. The erroneous policies adopted in the past have hindered the healthy development of trade. While this has caused only a limited growth in export on the one hand, the lack of proper import management, on the other, has led to various distortions and anomalies in the economy.
"
11370,"7. There is a lack of coordination between the production sector and the trade sector.
"
11371,"8. Proper backward and forward linkages are not yet fully established for the promotion of sustainable export trade.
"
11372,"Background of the Eighth Plan
"
11373,"The trade sector has an extremely significant role in accelerating the growth rate of economy.
"
11374,"The inward or outward looking policies and programmes adopted with reference to international trade promotion clearly reflect  the philosophy of development of a country and the contribution of its trade sector in the economy.
"
11375,"The failure of certain nations to achieve the desired pace of development due to their inward looking policies has been clearly noticed.
"
11376,"In Nepal also, the economic policies of the past nearly stagnated the pace of development and the inward looking policies adopted in the trade sector led to the increase in trade deficit.
"
11377,"Consequently, the trade, sector could not make desirable contribution to the economy due to the lack of appropriate policies and their satisfactory implementation as well as the inadequacy of production and diversification of exportable commodities.
"
11378,"As the extensive changes in the structure and outlook of _he world economy and the commensurate developments that have nearly established the indispensability of the market -oriented economy and out-ward' looking policies, the neighbouring countries, too, are heading towards competitive, market -oriented economy.
"
11379,"The fact that the countries with open, competitive and market-oriented economies have achieved greater acceleration in the pace of development than the countries with control-oriented economies has been clearly demonstrated in the international scenario.
"
11380,"In keeping with the formation of the government accountable to the people in Nepal and its commitment to eliminating the negative influences of the erroneous policies of the past in the economy, commensurable programmes will be implemented during the Eighth Plan to promote trade through the medium of competitive, market-oriented economy.
"
11381,"The Eighth Plan aims at making the trade sector fully competitive and market oriented within the plan period.
"
11382,"The efforts of the policies and programmes of the Eighth Plan alone will not su ffice to attain the development of the trade sector.
"
11383,"Therefore, in view of the experience of the past that any trade programmes introduced without reconciling them with the productive sector of the nation as a whole can not have a positive impact on trade, the programmes in the Eighth Plan have been formulated with a collective approach.
"
11384,"In the course of making the foreign trade more open, transparent and simplified, the trade sector has been reconciled with the taxation policy, revenue policy, the policies pertaining to public enterprises and the policy of privatization.
"
11385,"Similarly, a policy has been adopted to make rational efforts for the growth of production of exportable commodities only upon establishing direct interrelationships' witho	ther production sectors of the economy such as industry, agriculture  and forestry.
"
11386,"Aga inst this background, certain corrective policy measures have already been taken to provide an appropriate direction to the trade sector even before the implementation of the Eighth Plan and a compatible trade policy also has been implemented.
"
11387,"Objectives
"
11388,"1. To achieve robust and dynamic growth in the trade sector so that it can directly contribute to the national economy through the creation of more income and employment opportunities.
"
11389,"2. To attain a favourable balance of payment situation by increasing exports and thus earn more foreign exchange.
"
11390,"3. To diversify international trade by promoting backward linkages for attaining reliability and sustainability in the export trade.
"
11391,"4. To expand trade making it sustainable so that the trade deficit can be minimized by gradually reconciling imports with exports.
"
11392,"5. To bring about qualitative and-quantitative enhancement in the supply of consumer goods for domestic consumption through a proper market system.
"
11393,"6. To expand employment -oriented trade in harmony with other economic sectors.
"
11394,"7. To make transit facilities efficient and cost effective in order to channel optimum benefit from foreign trade to the economy. Policies
"
11395,"1. During the plan period, the trade sector will be made more liberal, completive and market oriented in view of its role as a major contributing sector for the achievement of a higher rate of growth in the economy.
"
11396,"2. The private sector will be inspired to assume a major role in the trade sector, confining the, role of the government to that of a catalyst and a facilitator.
"
11397,"3. Liberal and dynamic trade policies will be adopted to attain a favourable balance of payments situation by increasing export for higher fore ign exchange earnings and by making the domestic supply system more qualitative and practical from the economic point of view.
"
11398,"4. A higher rate of growth will be achieved in the standard quality production of goods and services for  domestic consumption as well as export by ensuring the proper and efficient utilization of economic resources.
"
11399,"5. Special efforts will be made to increase productwise and countrywise trade. 6. Efforts will be made to promote the, interrelationships, among industry, trade and other economic sectors in order to boost national production for export promotion as well as domestic supply.
"
11400,"7. The State Trading Organizations being run in the governmental sector will be gradually privatized in commensurate with the performance and development of the private sector.
"
11401,"8. Appropriate monetary and fiscal policies will be adopted and necessary changes will be made to the foreign exchange policy to make' the Nepalese currency fully convertible for the above mentioned activities in the trade and service sectors.
"
11402,"In addition) fundamental reforms will be effected in the administrative procedures so as to make them simpler, more transparent and dynamic.
"
11403,"Emphasis will be laid on the development of necessary institutional facilities and information network including the im provement in quality standards and monitoring system for the promotion of foreign trade.
"
11404,"For the promotion of international trade, the existing treaties and agreements with different countries and international agencies will be effectively implemented and more such treaties and agreements will be signed as necessary. 12.
"
11405,"Necessary promotional programmes will be undertaken in order to augment the trade with neighbouring countries (India and the Tibetan autonomous region of China) and other SAARC nations.
"
11406,"Proper import management will be organized so as to create a competitive industrial and commercial atmosphere by utilizing import as a means of export promotion and development and to ensure the smooth supply of essential domestic commodities through the efficient mobilization of available resources from the economic point of view_ In this regard, with the objective of promoting competitive production, quantitative restriction on imports will be gradually phased out and replaced by tariff structures.
"
11407,"Various efforts will be made to improve the transportationsystem and to construct necessary warehousing facilities in order to gradually reduce the t1.
"
11408,"In keeping with the above policies, various necessary arrangements will be made as follows:
"
11409,"a. Monetary and Exchange Management
"
11410,"1. Arrangements have been made for an exporter to sell to commercial banks a specified percentage of his convertible foreign currency earnings from the export of goods and services at an exchange rate fixed by the market system and the remaining amount to Nepal Rastra Bank at the government rate. This has been introduced as a preparatory -measure for granting full convertibility to Nepalese currency in the trade and service sectors in order to create a competitive commercial atmosphere by reconciling exports with imports.
"
11411,"Quantitative restriction and licensing system have been waived for the import of raw materials required by export-oriented and import-substituting industries.
"
11412,"However, the foreign exchange required for the import of these materials will have to be obtained from commercial banks at the rate fixed by the market system.
"
11413,"For trade promotion activities, an exporter is now permitted to open a foreign currency account with a certain percentage of his foreign currency -earnings.
"
11414,"2. Necessary arrangements will be made to make the Nepalese currency fully convertible in current account during the Eighth Plan period.
"
11415,"In this regard, gradually increasing the present percentage of partial convertibility of the Nepalese currency, the entire foreign currency transaction for commercial and service activities including the business of the government will eventually be conducted at the market rate. Thus, once the full convertibility is introduced, all foreign exchange transactions will be-conducted by the market.
"
11416,"3. Pre and post-export credit facility will be made available on a priority basis in a convenient manner.
"
11417,"b. Fiscal (Tax and Revenue) Management
"
11418,"1. The income from export is exempted from taxation and a tax holiday is also granted to the earnings from the export undertaken/on the basis of a letter of credit or any agreed banking document from India.
"
11419,"2. No exportable commodity in normal circumstances will be subjected to- any taxes other than service charges.
"
11420,"However, revenue structures will be developed for regulating the export of essential commodities required for the country. 3. 	f raw materials and intermediate goods required for the production of exportable commodities.
"
11421,"In this context, regarding the import of raw materials, a total waiver or the storage facility in a bonded warehouse will be granted depending on the need and the nature of the import.
"
11422,"A duty drawback scheme will be effectively implemented for the import 	o
"
11423,"4. An Export Processing Zone will be established for the promotion of export. No taxes or duties will be levied on the raw materials or subordinate raw materials to be used by industries established in the Zone.
"
11424,"Similarly, any other industry exporting more than 90 percent of its products also will be entitled to the facilities enjoyed by the industries of the Export Processing Zone.
"
11425,"5. The existing quantitative restriction on import will be gradually replaced by tariff structures and they will  be so adjusted that they do not affect the export -oriented and economically viable import substituting industries.
"
11426,"c. 	Licensing Arrangement
"
11427,"1. There will be a restriction on the exp ort of archaeological and religious items and those affect ing the environment. A quantitative restriction may also be imposed, if required, on the export of any foodgrains in short supply in the country but such restriction on these commodities, too, will be gradually replaced for the export of any other items
"
11428,"2. In the course of liberalising the country import trade while the import of some commodities has been restricted and a few others require a licence to be obtained under the, auction system, the import of remaining goods has been left open.
"
11429,"Under this arrangement, the import of industrial machinery- and services including the raw materials and consumables does not require any licence.
"
11430,"This system will remain in force until such time that there exists partial convertibility.
"
11431,"Upon the introduction of full convertibility of the Nepalese currency within this plan period, the licence by auction system for goods to be imported for commercial purposes also will be cancel led and the entire imports will be left open.
"
11432,"2. The Nepalese diplomatic missions overseas will be mobilised for the promotion of export and trade agencies will be opened and developed on an institutional basis depending upon necessity.
"
11433,"3. No quantitative restrictions will be imposed on the exportable items to be carried out by tourists visiting Nepal.
"
11434,"4. Necessary amendments or reforms compatible with the present policies will be made to the relevant acts and regulations relating to export and import trade.
"
11435,"The procedures and documents connected with export and import will be made simpler, shorter and more transparent.
"
11436,"Administrative procedures will be organised accordingly.
"
11437,"5. With the objective of promoting export on the basis of the position and development of export activities, every year a pilot export plan and programme will be formulated with the co-operation of the private sector and export will be boosted accordingly.
"
11438,"6. Arrangement will be made for uninterrupted monitoring and supervision in order to efficiently conduct the export and import activities and to prevent the emergence of any distortions in this sector and any possible trade diversion.
"
11439,"7. The import valuation system will be made more relevant with necessary improvements.
"
11440,"The basic structure required for this purpose will be formulated.
"
11441,"e. 	Transit, warehousing and Transportation Management
"
11442,"1. Studies of waterways and airways as alternative routes in addition to the existing ones will be conducted with a view to minimizing the transit and transportation costs.
"
11443,"2. Arrangement of air cargo at concessional rates for foreign trade will be explored.
"
11444,"3. Efforts will be made to have an appropriate place in Nepal linked with Calcutta Port with a broad gauge line in order to make the overseas export and import trade simpler and more cost effective.

"
11468,"In the Eighth Plan, the trade sector programmes are formulated on the premise that the government will act as a coordinator and facilitator and provide necessary infrastructure and support while the private sector is entrusted with the entire responsibility of carrying out other activities and programmes.'
"
11469,"a. Product Development and Export Market Promotion
"
11470,"In order to increase exports, there is a need for the production of high quality commodities in accordance with the international demand and interest, which also implies the necessity of the identification and development of new products on the basis of the feasibility of production of available exportable commodities.
"
11471,"It is equally, necessary to intensify the increase in exports to existing export markets, and to diversify the export market through the identification of new markets.
"
11472,"Hence, the export base can be sustainably extended if stability and high quality are achieved in exportable commodities through quality amelioration and production growth of existing exportable product diversification in accordance with the demand of the export mar ket, import and development of modern production technology , maintenance of high quality standards in the production process, identification and development of new exportable exploration of l1ew markets other than the existing ones and emphasis on promotional activities in the targeted markets.

"
11535,"Introduction

"
11551,"Although in the beginning, works relating to civil aviation were conducted with the assistance of Indian technicians, after 1972 these works began to be performed by the Nepalese themselves.
"
11552,"At present there are 43 airp0rts in Nepal, including/one international airport, and of/which 38 are under regular operation by RNAC.
"
11553,"The development and expansion of air transport have hot only helped in increasing the international contacts, but also contributed to the national integrity by making transportation possible to and from the remote places of the Kingdom.
"
11554,"It has been experienced that the international and domestic air transport systems have played a significant role in promoting tourism, trade and commerce, including in the times of emergency and natural calamities.
"
11555,"Progress during the Seventh Plan
"
11556,"The tourists inflow in Nepal had increased by 11.05 percent on the average during the first four years of the Seventh Plan (1984/851989/90), whereas it went down by 9.8 percent following - the deadlock due to the termination of trade and transit agreements between Nepal and India in 1989.
"
11557,"The foreign exchange earning reached upto US $ 6,83,43,000 towards the final year of the plan period, which grew by 11.24 percent as compared to the average during the five year period of the plan.
"
11558,"An average per tourist expenditure was us $ 320 (US $ 27 per day) during that time, and the average tourist stay was 11.68 days.
"

"
11594,"Existing problems
"
11595,"1. Very limited spots are available for tourism and these spots are put under increasingly high pressure.
"
11596,"2. There is a shortage of infrastructure necessary for proper 'development of existing as well as feasible tourist spots.
"
11597,"3. No attention has been focused on the promotion of environmental, cultural and religious properties while planning for the development of tourism.
"
11598,"4. There is a lack of appropriate programmes that would inspire tourists to a longer stay in Nepal incurring higher expenditure.
"
11599,"5. No effective implementation of the promotional works has been made for the development of tourism.
"
11600,"6. The services and capacity of international airlines which have a direct linkage with Nepal are insufficient.
"
11601,"7. Internal air services are limited and the services are not up to the required standard.
"
11602,"In the same way, adequate infrastructures are yet to be completed for the development of air transport.
"
11603,"8. Until now it has not been possible to increase the tourist inflow all round the year.
"
11604,"Consequently, the impact of seasonality on tourism is prevalent.
"
11605,"9. Tourism sector has not been able to maintain close linkage with other economic sectors.
"
11606,"In totality, there exists a problem of the supply of necessary materials for the promotion of tourism.
"
11607,"Also, there is a lack of appropriate policy, incentives, appropriate rules and regulations and their effective use.
"
11608,"Background of the Eighth Plan
"
11609,"The country abounds in beautiful natural scenes, challenging snow peaks for the courageous and the adventurous, and the rare, exquisite natural vistas for the explorers and the researchers.
"
11610,"Tourism industry can be developed in a way to contribute substantially to the national economic development by effectively using these heritages without causing any adverse impact on them.
"
11611,"For economic development and increased foreign currency earnings apart from the promotions of industry and trade in Nepal, the development of tourism sector as a service industry is indispensable.
"
11612,"This industry appears to possess higher comparative advantages in view of its being one of the important industries to earn foreign currency without causing any adverse effect on environment and also being endowed. With the opportunity of using the existing geographical and culture heritage.
"
11613,"Therefore, tourism industry should be promoted with higher priority.
"
11614,"This industry can also playa significant role in the development of rural and mountainous areas of Nepal.
"
11615,"This, being an employment oriented industry, can also be used to solve unemployment problems, if it is expanded to different additional areas of the country.
"
11616,"Taking the above facts into consideration, HMG in the Eighth Plan period, will attract private and foreign investors to the tourism industry in order to bring about effectiveness in the promotion of tourism by developing infrastructures in new aoristically feasible places.
"
11617,"In the same way, it will create a necessary atmosphere suitable for implementing the policies formulated with an eye on the apropriate participation of private sector, communities and non-governmental organisations.
"
11618,"The fact that the tourism industry could not be developed to directly influence the strengthening of country's economy in the past is evident from the problems noticed in this field.
"
11619,"Therefore, substantial steps will be taken to resolve these problems by formulating policies under tourism sector, in the Eighth Plan period.
"
11620,"His Majesty's Government, having followed a liberal economic policy and having taken tourism industry a2 a major sector, will playa coordinating and supportive role in the form of a catalytic agent to mobilise the private sector in its development.
"

11824,"However, a balanced development of all aspects of education in line with as pirations of the people and needs of the country could not be achieved due to too frequent changes in the education system and lack of a firm commitment to declared policies.
"
11825,"The elected government established after the reestablishment of the multi-party democratic system constituted the National Education commission to recommend reforms in the present education system so as to make it more accessible, effective, work oriented, and conducive to technological development on the basis of thorough study and analysis of all aspects of the education system such as educational policy and decision making, structure of educational administration, management of education, curriculum and textbooks.

"
11867,"Existing problems
"
11868,"The following problems in the education sector are identified on the basis of analysis of achievements during the Seventh plan period and the present status of education. 1. The national goal of universalization of primary education by the year 2000 A.D.
"
11869,"Requires significant increase in girls enrolment.
"
11870,"The lack of progress in this direction stands as a serious problem. Similarly, in view if the fact that as many as 60% people are illiterate, the present efforts to raise the literacy rate are very inadequate.
"
11871,"2. There has been a significant quantitative progress in education; this has not been matched by progress in raising the quality of education. the education system has been unable to contribute to meeting the needs of the rural areas; consequently, the education system has failed to promote the real development of the country.
"
11872,"3. The internal efficiency of school education is quite low.
"
11873,"Because of the high drop-out and repetition rates, completion of primary education requires over 9 years on an average instead of the requisite period of 5 years.
"
11874,"4. The financial burden of the government of supporting the education sector is increasing day by day. Primary education is already free, and secondary education is also being made free.
"
11875,"In this process, much resources are involved. For promoting education of qualitative standards, efforts of the government are not alone sufficient.
"
11876,"5. On the one hand, there has not been an effective extension in the training of teachers, who have important role in raising the quality of education and, on the other; it has not been possible to make the teachers responsible towards their duties.
"
11877,"6. The present constitution of the country has provided opportunity to individuals belonging to every group, region, and community to acquire education.
"
11878,"Making special education programmes more extensive and effective is quite essential in order to provide education to the disabled persons affected by various handicaps, who form a significant group of people .
"
11879,"7. There is a lack of definite policies and regulations regarding the involvement of the private sector in the education sector.
"
11880,"8. The teacher pupil ratio in technical education is just 1:7.
"
11881,"This has caused the unit cost of technical education very high, making technical education expensive.
"
11882,"9. The pressure of admission in campuses has become problematic, due to the ever increasing number of students seeking enrolment in higher education. On the other hand, as the university has to bear heavy administrative expenditures, it has not been able to make investment in instructional and academic development activities to the desired extent.
"
11883,"At the same time, there is a need to make earnest efforts to raise the quality of higher education.
"
11884,"10.
"
11885,"A great deal of work still remains to be accomplished in appropriate preservation and renovation of monuments and sites included in the world heritage list and recognized as of international importance. The same is true in the case of other archaeological, cultural, historical monuments and sites of national and international importance.
"
11886,"At the same time not enough work has been done to promote language and dialects spoken in Nepal, and local culture.
"
11887,"Background of the Eighth Plan
"
11888,"In defining the objectives, targets and strategies in the Eighth Plan for the development of the education sector in keeping with the times, attention has been paid to the progress achieved in the education sector up to now, the current problems of the sector and the provisions relating to education and culture in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990.
"
11889,"Special emphasis has to be laid during the Eight Plan period on the development and expansion of basic and primary education in view of the national goal of universalization of primary education, and the attainment of literacy rate of 67% by the year 2000 A.D.
"
11890,"In view of the fact that qualitative improvements have lagged behind quantitative expansion in the education sector in the past, emphasis has to be given on improving the quality of education.
"
11891,"For this, it is necessary to give stress of increasing the number of trained teachers, improvement of physical facilities of the schools, curriculum development in keeping with the needs of  the country, provision of textbooks, and regular and effective supervision of schools.
"
11892,"At the same time, necessary measures have to be taken to maximize the participation of people of disadvantaged areas, tribal groups and women in education.
"
11893,"The government resources are inadequate to meet the growing demand and aspirations of the people for acquiring higher education. Thus, it seems necessary to extend university and campuses on the basis of people's participation.
"
11894,"At the same time, It is necessary to implement reform measures for promoting qualitative improvement in higher education.
"
11895,"Against this background, and keeping in mind the main spirit of the Report of the National Education Commission, the objectives and policies of the Eighth Plan in the education sector have been determined.

"
12217,"Nor was there any progress noticed in the expansion of physical and other facilities for Infectious Diseases Hospital (at Teku), Kanti Children's Hospital, Indra Rajya Laxmi Maternity Hospital and Bhaktapur Hospital.
"
12218,"These hospitals were able to conduct only their regulars services. The Seventh plan aimed at initiating on a phased basis the extension of regional hospitals in all the Development Regions except the Middle Development Region.

"
12241,"In the fiscal Years 1990-91 and 1991-92 that is to say, over the last 2 year various programmes related to basic health services, curative services, and health- promotive services were conducted.
"
12242,"The progress achieved in these programmes is as follows.
"
12243,"Under the primary health services, integrated health services have been provided through Ilaka-level health posts. Accordingly, under the family planning and mother and child health services, the number of couples using the family planning devices has been raised to 854,225 (estimated) and the numbers of pregnant and breast feeding mothers and of infants and children availing health service facilities have stood at 918, 251 an d 584,137 respectively, On the malaria eradication front, the malaria- affected area inhabited by a population of 720,000 has been sprayed with insecticides and upon the collection of blood samples, persons identified as malaria- afflicted have been given necessary treatment.

"
12245,"Moreover, with the objective of reducing infant mortality rate, diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases control programmes as well as nutrition programmes are under implementation.
"
12246,"In accordance with the health policy 1991, which aims at providing hospital- bed facility to primary health services and health institutions to village Development committees, 20 primary health centers and 200 sub health posts have been established in various village development committees.

"
12249,"In keeping with the policy of running a 15 bed hospital in each district, the construction of hospital buildings is underway in 10 districts.
"
12250,"In addition to providing Medicines and equipments to hospitals and other health organizations, health lab services, health education, nutrition and other activities have been conducted.
"
12251,"Regarding the ayurvedic services, works for the development of Naradevi Hospital and Singh Durbar Vaidyakhana have been initiated and the hospital in Dang has already started providing services.
"
12252,"The problems encountered in the implementation of various programmes and projects designed for the seventh plan are similar to those annually experienced in the implementation of the previous plans of these, of course, the problems that arose from the dearth of manpower and physical facilities in the health organizations and those concerned with administrative and financial management appear to be the major ones.
"
12253,"They are as follows.
"
12254,"1. Owing to the topographical difficulties and the pressure exerted by the growth in the number of patients, the health sector has not been able to make primary health services available to the targeted populations. if in the Himalayan and hill regions the walking distance itself has been a problem in the Terai belt, because of the pressure of the increased number of patients it has been difficult to provide even minimum health services.
"
12255,"Background of he Eighth Plan: Although the efforts made through the previous plans for the development of health services have, in some measure, helped to improve the health of the common people, the health level of Nepal, has, as shown by the health indicators, remained much lower than that of any other developing country.
"
12256,"Besides, as per the commitment made by Nepal in the SAARC Summit for Children 1989 and the World Summit for Children. 1990, health services for children have to be toned up, too.
"
12257,"The objective, policy and programmes of the Eighth Plan are as follows.
"
12258,"Objective
"
12259,"1. To produce healthy manpower necessary for development by improving the general health status of the people;
"
12260,"2. To raise the health status of the rural people by reaching basic primary health and medical services done to the village level;
"
12261,"3. To control population by making mother and child health and family planning services effective as per the people's aspirations at the local level;
"
12262,"4. To make quality health services available within the country by developing specialist-specific services.
"
12263,"Policy
"
12264,"1. In order to make health services available on a phased basis to each Village Development Committee, the services of women health volunteers, sub-health posts, health posts and primary health centres will be provided at wards, village development committees and electoral constituencies respectively.
"
12265,"2. Integrated primary health service will be provided through the primary health centres.
"
12266,"Besides, hospital bed service will be made available, in primary health centres, for maternity and emergency treatments.
"
12267,"To support the referral system a  coordination net -work covering primary health centres and district, zonal and national hospitals will be established.
"
12268,"6. To make specialist and general curative services available within the kingdom itself, the private sector  also will be mobilized.
"
12269,"For this, a policy of providing facilities will be adopted.
"
12270,"While a large amount of money has been invested in buildings under Government ownership, many government offices continue to bear big financial burden due to the compulsion of staying in rented buildings.
"
12271,"In addition to this, other sources of loan, particularly cooperative loan schemes will also be utilized.
"
12272,"This program has been operating since the fiscal year 1982/83 to provide skill-oriented training to socially and economically backward village wome n so as to increase their employment opportunities.
"
12273,"The facilities for computer use have increased and efficiency in its use has also improved.
"
12274,"During the two fiscal years of the interim period, the National Planning Commission Secretariat conducted various development works. These included monitoring and evaluation programme, natural and cultural resource conservation, preparation and publication of the Eighth Plan, a study on the impact of the Seventh Plan oil tire general life of the people decentralization programme, library development, preparation of annual programme, strengthening of the National Planning Commission Secretariat, and programmes for the National Council of Science and Technology.
"
12275,"Among these programmes, the one on monitoring and evaluation was carried out during the fiscal year 1990/91 according to set target, but as the concept of priority projects was withdrawn during the fiscal year 1991/92, this plan was net implemented. The programme on natural and cultural resource conservation made progress as planned during the fiscal year 1990/91, cut failed to make satisfactory progress during 1991/92 duo to various reasons, the chief among which was the failure to establish the proposed National Land Resources and Environment Centre for formulating policies, conducting research and coordinating all conservation activities in the country.
"
12276,"Approach to the Eighth Plan has been published and the main text of the Plan is being prepared for publication.
"
12277,"The Report on the impact of the Seventh Plan on the general life of the people has been prepared.
"
12278,"Village-level studies have been made in 6 districts with a view to bringing about necessary reform in the decentralization programme, and various training programmes have been conducted for gazetted and non-gazetted employees, Similarly, under the library development programme a wide range of books and periodicals have been obtained through contacts and publication-exchange agreements with international agencies and government libraries. The Secretariat has also published a periodical entitled ""Development"".
"
12279,"Apart from this annual programme, reports have been published and distributed.
"
12280,"HMC has provided logistic support as per agreement to the National Planning Commission Secretariat strengthening project.
"
12281,"A policy based study was conducted on the programmes related to the National Council for Science and Technology and a report to this effect has been published.
"
12282,"These included publication of statistics and information, library development, development of Social statistics, economic indexes, national agricultural census, national population census and national accounts development projects, Among these under the project of Data Publication and Library Development, the, library of Central Bureau of Statistics was equipped and various pubiications relating to data were brought out.
"
12283,"Regarding economic indicators programme, indices of agricultural and industrial production were prepared; the results of the manufacturing census were published by editing and refining the data subsequent to the completion of the survey; and the preparatory work for the 1993-94 manufacturing census was completed. similarly, the regional census of agriculture 1991/92 and the preparatory work for National Agriculture Census were completed.
"
12284,"During 1990/91 and 1991/92 periods, the statistics on national accounts were collected, the gross national product was estimated and the results of the Multi-purpose Production Survey were published.
"
12285,"Various programmes related to the use of computers were conducted during this period. These included System development and software support, system transfer and implementation, training, maintenance and engineering support, development in research and consultation. The progress being made in these programmes is satisfactory.
"
12286,"National Council for science and Technology (NCST) During these two years, studies were conducted on technology transfer and a report was prepared on the role of women in the development and use of technology.
"
12287,"The newly elected government in giving the highest priority to administrative reforms, formed a high-level Administration Reform commission in 1991/92 under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
"
12288,"This Commission made exhaustive studies and has presented its suggestions and recommendations on administrative reforms. within this period, various activities were also carried out on a regular basis.
"
12289,"These included studies on administrative organization and management, seminars of the heads of offices, the transfer and promotion of gazetted officers, preparation of a legal provisions for departmental action, scholarships and foreign training. Existing Problems
"
12290,"The review of progress made in various development programmes implemented by the National Planning Commission Secretariat has revealed problems related to the lack of adequate funding or under-utilization of funds. These development programmes have also suffered from failure to apportion the amount of funds as demanded.
"
12291,"On the other hand, the amount of funds invested cannot be spent as required due to financial regulations.
"
12292,"Apart from these problems, the lack of skilled manpower in the National Planning commission Secretariat is another handicap.
"
12293,"The National Statistics Council established to develop and coordinate all statistical activities has been less effective due to the lack of appropriate legal provisions to meet now demands and needs.
"
12294,"The various programmes implemented by the Central Bureau of Statistics are being handicapped by various problems including the dependency an foreign aid and the failure to enter into agreements in time with donor agencies.
"
12295,"The gross domestic product of the country is still being estimated on the basis of incomplete and unreliable data.
"
12296,"The available economic statistics are not upto date and this hinders improvement in the computation of the national income.
"
12297,"Further, the problem is compounded by a lack of permanently employed skilled and, professional manpower in statistics.
"
12298,"Computer The failure to achieve desired success in the implementation of programmes conducted by the National Computer Centre is due mainly to the unfavourable conditions prevailed in the country at that time.
"
12299,"The programmes implemented by the National council for Science and Technology usually face many problems due to delays in the sanction of the budget, preparation of reports by research workers and evaluation by experts.
"
12300,"The measures that have been taken to bring administrative reforms have so far proved ineffective.
"
12301,"The present slackness in administration has, therefore, failed to provide essential services to the general public.
"
12302,"More specifically, the existing problems include the failure to simplify the administrative system, the failure to assess the performance of officials effectively through a system of rewards and punishments, failure to promote or upgrade professional competence on the basis of long-term needs, the lack of delegation of authority and responsibility to lower level employees and the inability to identify delegated authority due to vague and non-transparent provisions.

12403,"It is self-evident that the employees will be able to increase their work effic iency if they can be given in-service and refresher trainings as required.
"
12404,"The Administrative staff College was established to provide necessary training for the higher and mid-level employees. During the Eighth Plan, the Administrative Staff College will implement various training programmes including' in-service training; training for gazetted first and second class officers, employees of government as well as non-government organisations.
"
12405,"The Plan aims to organize 10 seminars for HMG officials and the heads of government departments.
"
12406,"Besides, studies an the current administrative problems, certain services such as consultancy and trainer-trainee interaction will be offered.
"
12407,"The-Revenue Administrative Training Centre will conduct various training programmes to improve the revenue service by mobilising its internal resources, to upgrade the efficiency of staff and to provide other necessary services.
"
12408,"Implementation Arrangements
"
12409,"The secretariat of the National Planning Commission will prepare and implement various programmes outlined in the Eighth Plan. These will include programmes related to planning, statistics, and computers as specified in the procedures of implementation.
"
12410,"The programmes relating to statistics will be implemented by the Central Bureau of Statistics and the various units under it. The programmes on computers will be implemented by the National Computer Centre.
"
12411,"The programme related to vital statistics will be carried out by the Home Ministry.
"
12412,"All programmes on Science and Technology will be implemented by the National Council for Science and Technology which functions as a government organization under the National Planning Commission Secretariat.'
"
12413,"The administrative reform programmes will be implemented by the Ministry of General Administration, the Public service commission and the Administrative Staff College.
"
12414,"The programmes on revenue administration training will be carried out by the Centre for Revenue Administrative Training.
"
12415,"Details of Expenditure
"
12416,"It is estimated that a total of 133 million rupees will be spent in 1991/92 at the constant price. This amount will be used to implement various programmes specified under the project heads of the Eighth Plan.
"
12417,"Out of this total amount, the sum of 56 million rupees is expected to be spent for the National Planning Commission Secretariat and the National Council for Science and Technology. A total of some 77 million rupees is expected to be spent in implementing the programmes on statistics.
"
12418,"This amount includes the budgets assigned to various area off ices at the regional and district levels operating under the National Planning Commission Secretariat.
"
12419,"The expenditures required by the National Computer Centre will be met from its own revenue sources. The government will also take necessary steps to obtain support and assistance from foreign countries to help develop programmes and projects on computer technology.
"
12420,"During this Plan period, it is estimated that a sum of 170 million rupees will be spent in fulfilling the aims and policies of administrative reforms.
"
12421,"Thus the total amount to be spent under the heading ""The Plan and Administrative Reform"" during the Eighth Plan is expected to be 303 million rupees.
"
12422,"Poverty Alleviation
"
12423,"Background
"
12424,"Poverty is a widespread phenomenon in Nepal.
"
12425,"Though there is a lack of dependable data as regards the magnitude of poverty it is estimated that 9 million people (i.e. 49 percent of Nepal's total population) live in absolute poverty.
"
12426,"The country's development is obviously impossible without the participation of such a huge section of population in the development process.
"
12427,"Hence, special efforts will, therefore, be made during the Eighth Plan for poverty alleviation.
"
12428,"Instead, different materials and services provided by the government as grants or at subsidized rates were utilized either by the relatively well off ones or by the comparatively better-off group among the poor.
"
12429,"The situation was such that the households living in the condition of abject poverty and backwardness, both socially and economically, did not either know at all about the services delivered by the government or they were not able to utilize such services even if they knew about them.
"
12430,"For this reason, the poverty alleviation programmes to be undertaken in the Eighth Plan will be so formulated and implemented that the relatively well-to-do families may not grab these benefits and the real poor ones will benefit directly or indirectly.
"
12431,"Since, the poverty alleviation task is of multi-.. in nature; it is essential for the programmes of all sectors to make a concerted effort to alleviate poverty.
"
12432,"Hence, all the sectoral programmes will be directed towards poverty alleviation.
"
12433,"Identification of the Actual Poor
"
12434,"It is essential to identify the backward rural areas and the people living below absolute poverty line before formulating and implementing poverty alleviation programme.
"
12435,"The criteria used in the past under the rural development programme to identify poor families were faculty therefore, the target group could not benefit effectively from the programme.
"
12436,"The poverty level of people living in rural community can be easily ascertained on the basis of their housing, food, cloths and other living conditions. However, such a procedure would be rather ad- hoc and inadequate to specify the level of poverty on the basis of specific parameters which can reflect the real situation explicitly.
"
12437,"In the past, different organizations employed different parameters to assess the level of poverty; so there was no uniformity in them and no accurate assessment could b e made available regarding the extent of poverty in the country.
"
12438,"In the Eighth Plan, simple parameters will be devised to ascertain the real situation of poverty. Accordingly, the poor people living in the areas where the poverty alleviation programme is to be introduced will be identified and effective programs will be launched for social and economic upliftment of. such families.
"
12439,"Decision will also be made regarding the region where such 'programmes ought to reach.
"
12440,"Policy Arrangements
"
12441,"The following polic ies will be adopted to alleviate poverty during the Eighth Plan period: (a) To develop a simple procedure for identification of undeveloped areas and poor families and use it uniformly across all sectoral programmes.
"
12442,"(b) 	To carry out self-targeted and targeted programmes for poor people.
"
12443,"(c) 	To increase the access of the poor to the means of production.
"
12444,"(d) 	To make arrangements for awarding contracts of technically simple construction works to groups of poor people.
"
12445,"(e) 	To make legal provisions for elimination of social evils and to create public awareness in this regard.
"
12446,"(f) 	To make effective legal provisions against exploitation of the poor and the helpless.
"
12447,"(g) 	To initiate dialogue for negotiations with foreign governments/ agencies for the employment of unskilled and skilled Nepalese manpower seeking employment in foreign countries.
"
12448,"(h) 	To arrange for creating employment opportunities in non-agricultural sector through food security programmes.
"
12449,"(i) 	To take environmental balance into consideration while designing a programme.
"
12450,"(j) 	To make institutional arrangements for extending necessary support to the task of poverty alleviation. Programme
"
12451,"The people in general, irrespective of the region they live in, can be benefitted from the investment made by the government in building various social and physical infrastructures and in developing agriculture, industry and other economic activities.
"
12452,"However, such investment may not reach those nooks and corners of the Kingdom  which are inhabited by the poorest of the poor.
"
12453,"For the purpose, it is deemed necessary to envisage a special programme for the socio - economic upliftment of those places and the people living there.
"
12454,"Programmes such as production credit, training, provision of employment, children's education, nutrition for mothers and babies, etc. will be introduced for poor families on individual or collective basis.
"
12455,"Emphasis will be laid on the construction of assets community like *road, bridge, school, drinking water, irrigation and health post which would, directly or indirectly, benefit poor households. The following programmes and targets have been set for the improving the socioeconomic condition of the poor during the Eighth Plan:
"
12456,"To Develop Physical Infrastructure
"
12457,"Since poverty is generally rampant in backward areas, arrangements will be made for the construction of physical infrastructures such as roads, irrigation projects etc. for the development of such areas.
"
12458,"Such labour-intensive construction works will generate employments for the poor.
"
12459,"Programmes such as food -for-work will be utilized for the creation of these physical infrastructures.
"
12460,"Arrangements of labour-certificate will also be made under this programme.
"
12461,"Infrastructure development projects will be executed by the government or non-government agencies and arrangements will be made to deposit some portion of the remuneration earned by the participating labourers into a nearby financial institutions in order to enable the workers to draw loans from financial institutions against the labour certificate issued to them.
"
12462,"B.
"
12463,"To Increase the Poor's Access to Means of Production
"
12464,"The community and natural resources and assets available in the various parts of Nepal but not yet adequately harnessed will be studied and evaluated and made available to the poor households free or on lease.
"
12465,"These resources include forest land with thin crown cover, waste land, pond, lake and river bank etc.
"
12466,"The surplus land above the land ceiling will also be acquired and used for settling the poor in a systematic manner on the basis of social justice.
"
12467,"C. Education and Training
"
12468,"Education and training will be another important component of poverty alleviation programme.
"
12469,"Other sub-components under this will be functional nonformal education, adult literacy programmes, social awareness development training, skill development training for the successful implementation of income generating activities, entrepreneurship development training, excursion tours of successful programme sites etc.
"
12470,"Follow-up arrangements of the training will be ensured by arranging necessary assistance, support and supervision mechanism.
"
12471,"These programmes will be launched in order to make the poor people fully aware of different activities such as those of social, economic or legal nature and appropriate technology that have direct impact on them and raise their level of awareness.
"
12472,"Under this programme, expansion of programme -wise assistance to communication facilities, formation of mobile communications teams, establishment of community centres, use of video- technology and different other means and technologies of communications will be brought into practice.
"
12473,"E. Population Programmes
"
12474,"Since it has been observed that the number of poor grows at a faster rate under a higher rate of population growth, it has been imperative to adopt effective measures to check population growth for the success of poverty alleviation programmes.
"
12475,"Activities under the population programme for the poor mainly include awareness raising programme about fa mily planning use of contraceptives, control of birth rate, maternal-child health care, child care and nutrition 'and increased supply of means of birth control:
"
12476,"F. Employment Generation
"
12477,"As it is imperative to have a healthy body in order to qualify for employment, efforts for food and improved health  of the poor will be taken as a precondition.
"
12478,"Employment for the poor will be generated through intensive farming programmes, increased construction activities, establishment of refinery and industrial districts and promotion of employment'opportunities in other nonagriculture based activities.
"
12479,"Employment opportunities for the poor and landless families will increase to a marked extent due to their access to land and other public and community assets.
"
12480,"The simplification of process of obtaining credit for employment generating activities and provision of increased  fund for the credit programme may also bring about an increase in the income generating employment opportunities.
"
12481,"G. Food Security Programme
"
12482,"Food security measures will be adopted in order to involve the poor in relatively more market-oriented activities for increasing their income.
"
12483,"These measures include expansion of food-for-work programme, effort for increased integration of hill and Terai markets, arrangements- for regional food storage, developing awareness for change in food habits, diversification in food consumption, control of foodgrain leakage and improvement in the system of foodgrain procurement and distribution.
"
12484,"H. Development of Technology for the Poor
"
12485,"Efforts will be made for developing, testing and extending divisible and appropriate medium-scale technology suited to the capacity of the poor, in particular, with the allocation of larger research grants.
"
12486,"I. Labour Export
"
12487,"Labour may be exported in two ways: first through the increase in the export of the labour-based products and secondly by direct export of workers thus benefiting them from the higher rate of wages existing in the countries importing labour.
"
12488,"J. special Programmes for Women
"
12489,"Whe reas the above gender discriminatory programmes may benefit the women in different ways, other special programmes for women will also be launched. Activities under these programmes will include enactment of effective law against dowry system, development of time -saving technologies for women-run activities, health and nutrition programmes for lactatory mothers, income generating activities for the upliftment of women in the family as well as the society.
"
12490,"K. Special Programmes for Backward Ethnic Tribes
"
12491,"It has been found that various tribes and aborigines of the hills and the Terai have not been effectively benefitted from the general development programmes, Hence, appropriate programmes will be developed and implemented for their social and economic upliftment.
"
12492,"Increasing the Effectiveness of Current Programmes
"
12493,"The poverty alleviation programmes currently in operation will continue as they are and higher efficiency will be developed in their working style.
"
12494,"Under this organizational structure of programmes such as Production Credit for Rural Women, Remote Area Development Programme, Integrated Rural Development projects etc., will be improved and focused towards the poor.
"
12495,"The targets, of these programmes have already been mentioned in the chapter on Local Development.
"
12496,"Organizational functions such as organizing the poor in groups so far being carried out by these programmes will gradually be handed over to the NGOs and individuals assigned to National Development Service (NDS) programme, thus confining the task of these programmes only to service delivery and enhancing their efficiency.
"
12497,"Institutional Arrangement
"
12498,"To carry out the aforesaid programmes for poverty alleviation effectively, necessary institutions would be set up. A.
"
12499,"Establishment of a Trust-Fund in connection with the development of necessary institutional arrangements for the socio-economic upliftment of the backward areas and the identified poor, a feasibility study for the e stablishment of an autonomous Trust Fund will be carried out during the Eighth Plan and the Fund will be established accordingly.
"
12500,"The Fund from within its resources will make available grants and loans for the institutional development of NGOs, private sector, consumers'/users' committees and farmers' groups and for the package programmes of poverty alleviation to be executed by these organizations/agencies.
"
12501,"Likewise, the Fund will provide grants and loans for initiating poverty alleviation programmes in place and areas where sectoral programmes to be implemented by different government agencies are felt inadequate.
"
12502,"These groups may organize themselves as intergroup units, small-scale cooperatives, full scale cooperatives or further higher level institutions.
"
12503,"These groups or organizations may include such units as specialized contractors's groups, production units, marketing groups, commodity organizations, industrial units, services units and any other groups engaged in different activities.
"
12504,"An atmosphere conducive to their becoming self-sufficient will be created and necessary unity among these groups will be ensured.
"
12505,"Training has an important place in this regard.
"
12506,"In course of the programme implementation, the Trust will develop necessary planning-related indices to be included in its future policies and programmes.
"
12507,"During the Eighth Plan period, a pilot programme will be carried out by the Trust Fund.
"
12508,"Accordingly, model village programines will be conducted at 10 places one in the hills and one in the Terai of each development region.
"
12509,"Under this programme, the poor farmers will be organized into groups and arrangements will be made so as to ensure retail services in the locality through the intergroup units; and service agencies in such areas will only deliver wholesale services.
"
12510,"It is estimated that it will, at least, take 5 years to develop such institutional arrangements in a region.
"
12511,"While making the Small Farmers' Development Programme being implemented by the Agricultural Development Bank for the socioeconomic upliftment of small farmers more effective by developing maximum number of self-motivated organizations thus improving the lot of member poor families through these organizations, the programme (SFDP) will also be extended to new poverty stricken backward areas.
"
12512,"In the same vein, similar approach will be adopted with regard to ""Production Credit for Rural Womens"" programme.
"
12513,"C. Revival of the National Development Service Programme
"
12514,"A feasibility study will be undertaken to align the National Development Service Programme with poverty alleviation by bringing about necessary changes in the programme conducted by Tribhuvan University earlier.
"
12515,"At the third level there will be a Poverty Monitoring Unit established under the Rural Development and Decentralization Division of the National Planning Commission.
"
12516,"The functions of this unit will be as follows:
"
12517,"1. To conduct basic/baseline surveys and determine the magnitude and level of poverty.
"
12518,"2. To develop necessary planning indices relating to poverty alleviation policies and programmes.
"
12519,"3. To determine the number of those crossing the poverty line through various poverty alleviation programmes.
"
12520,"4. To identify disadvantaqed/backward areas having a high number of poor population. Targets and Programmes
"
12521,"The magnitude of poverty will remain confined to conjecture unless the poor are really identified.
"
12522,"Recently, the number of the poor in Nepal is estimated to be approximately 9 million, one-third of them being ultra-poor.
"
12523,"Even more alarming is the future outlook of poverty which is to grow further in magnitude.
"
12524,"According to recent estimation, the annual increase in the number of poor households has been 2.2 percent. If the present trend continues, the number of the poor will reach 10.2 million, i.e. an increase of 1.2 million by the end of Eighth Plan.
"
12525,"Considerable efforts should be made even to maintain the absolute number of poor at the present level.
"
12526,"Therefore, the, poverty alleviation programme will have to make a quantum leap as regards the process and quality of target activities. This requires collective efforts of all sectors/quarters for poverty alleviation.
"
12527,"As more than 49 percent of the nation's total population live below poverty line, the Eighth Plan has envisaged the alleviation of poverty as one of its major objectives.
"
12528,"To achieve this end, it is essential to create opportunities of productive employment for the existing as well as rapidly increasing labour force. owing to high population growth rate as well as women's labour force participation, the number of employment seekers has gone up from 4,850,000 to 8,500,000 during 1971-91.
"
12529,"In the last two decades labour force has increased by 183,000 annually i.e.
"
12530,"2.9 percent per annum. However,- the growth rate of labour force has not coincided with the rate of economic growth.
"
12531,"As a result, productive employment has not increased, giving rise to the issue of unemployment and underemployment, which has further aggravated the problem of poverty.
"
12532,"Despite the priority given to the generation of employment in the previous plans, there had been no substantial progress in this field owing to the lack of political commitment and weak implementation.
"
12533,"The previous plans had surveyed the need for manpower of various levels, but, owing to slackness in implementation, even high-level manpower like engineers, medical doctors and agriculturists were unemployed. At present, the following are the challenges confronting the country in respect of existing manpower and employment:
"
12534,"According to a recent estimation, labour force will go up at the rate of 200,000 individuals annually, i.e. 2.3 percent during the next plan period.
"
12535,"The greatest challenge is to create opportunities of productive employment for them.
"
12536,"About 650,000 persons are estimated now to have remained unemployed.
"
12537,"To create employment opportunities for them is another big issue.
"
12538,"The existin g underemployment poses another difficult problem.
"
12539,"According to the present estimation, about 1,000,000 additional jobs will be required to resolve this problem of underemployment.
"
12540,"All these issues cannot be sorted out within a single plan period. it will be the main objective of the manpower and employment policy to reduce the pressure of growing unemployment and underemployment gradually and to involve the maximum manpower in the task of national development in a dynamic and productive manner.
"
12541,"Approximately 1,449,000 productive jobs are estimated through public and private investments in various sectors during the plan period.
"
12542,"The estimated number of jobs to be created in the various sectors will be as follows:
"
12543,"The following policies will be adopted to create the above estimated opportunities of employment and enable the nation's manpower to exploit them.
"
12544,"Policies
"
12545,"1. Despite the low growth rate of estimated employment in agricultural sector, it is the only sector which can provide the largest number of jobs in the country; it has the highest potential for absorbing labour force along with productivity within a short period.
"
12546,"The agricultural sector will, therefore, receive priority as regards to the allocation of investment. in order to create additional employment opportunities in this sector, investment will be directed towards crop intensification and diversification in particular, as there is little probability of expanding the area of arable land.
"
12547,"Accordingly, agricultural programmes like irrigation, development of cash crops and agroforestry will be emphasized.
"
12548,"2. As unemployment and underemployment are mostly found in rural areas, programmes for developing rural infrastructures will be accorded priority.
"
12549,"In selecting these programmes, priority will be given to the programmers conducive to agriculture and other programmes.
"
12550,"These rural programmes will be carried out by local agencies as far as possible.
"
12551,"Emphasis will be laid on adopting labour-oriented technology in implementing them.
"
12552,"3. To resolve the problems related to rural unemployment and underemployment, small and cottage industries appropriate to rural areas will be provided with incentives.
"
12553,"To achieve it, programmes will be carried out with additional provisions of technical assistance, skill training, loan facility, etc.
"
12554,"In addition, necessary reforms will be brought in the legal provisions pertaining to industry, commerce, customs and taxation.
"
12555,"4. 	it is not feasible to sort out employment-related issues in long-term perspective without promoting non- agricultural sectors.
"
12556,"The private sector will assume major role in non-agricultural fields.
"
12557,"Foreign investments will also be encouraged for the promotion of this sector.
"
12558,"5. The traditional and non-traditional industries and professions which can rapidly add up to productive jobs will be identified and necessary provisions will be made to promote them. 6. The existing industries and enterprises are confined to a few places in the country.
"
12559,"In this connection necessary policies and rules will be formulated and incentives will be provided for dispersing industries and enterprises in various parts of the country, especially in undeveloped areas.
"
12560,"7. Necessary policy measures will be adopted to encourage the use of labour-intensive technologies in agricultural as well as non-agricultural sector.
"
12561,"At the same time, emphasis will be laid on the development and extension of technologies contributing to the growth in labour-productivity.
"
12562,"8. As most of the existing manpower in the country is illiterate and unskilled, opportunities for basic education and technical and vocational training will be extended to rural areas in particular.
"
12563,"9. The existing manpower will be made skilful and efficient to compete in labour market.
"
12564,"Opportunities for foreign employment will be identified and provisions will be made in an organized way to allow Nepalese workers of different levels to take up jobs abroad.
"
12565,"11.
"
12566,"Various types of training programmes will be carried out to promote manpower's productivity.
"
12567,"Necessary steps will be taken to offer tax incentives and other facilities to industrialists to organise productivity enhancing training for their workers.
"
12568,"12.
"
12569,"Provisions will be made on institutionalized basis to assist labourer for acquisition of jobs.
"
12570,"13.
"
12571,"If the present growth rate of labour force continues, it will be difficult to' solve the problem of unemployment.
"
12572,"Necessary arrangements will be made for the agencies concerned to collect and update information and statistical details related to manpower and employment.
"
12573,"Attention will be given to women's maximum participation while formulating various policies and imparting training regarding employment and as far as possible, targets will be explicitly stated.
"
12574,"The statistical details pertaining to employment and manpower will be collected in such a way as to specify the status of male and female separately
"
12575,"Existing Situation Nepal is well-known all over the World because of the beauty of its natural and cultural heritages.
"
12576,"However, for  the last few decades, the natural resources have been facing depletion owing to poverty, slow economic development, higher population growth, unplanned urbanization and establishment of industrial sectors, lack of renovation and preservation of the sites of cultural value, lack of environmental education and lack of attention towards the environmental aspects in the formulation and implementation of development plans.
"
12577,"The major problems concerning nature and its flora and fauna have res ulted from rapid forest depletion, land erosion, loss of bio-diversity, desertification and the deterioration of the soil fertility and so on.
"
12578,"In addition, the soil quality has been affected at places due to irrational use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, resulting in soil and water-related environmental problems.
"
12579,"In Nepal, forests are under tremendous pressure, they are the only source for 90 percent of fuel, timber, fodder and other forest products required for domestic purposes.
"
12580,"This pressure is further aggravated by the slow economic growth and increasing population, and with deforestation there has been a decline in productivity in agricultural sector, while the ecology of hills has been badly affected by soil erosion and land slide. Land surface has also been adversely affected by, unscientific cultivation of marginal and steep slope land on hills.
"
12581,"A similar situation prevails in Chure region, where an extensive deterioration of the vegetation and living creatures is noticed. Similarly the Soil erosion and flood resulting from the gradual degeneration of this vulnerable region has reduced the fertility of land in the Terai.
"
12582,"The soil erosion in Chure hills, which occupies 13 percent of the country's total area, has posed itself as a major nationalproblem.
"
12583,"Land erosion, landslide, decline in the soil fertility of land and lack of suitable employment opportunities have acted as the main contributing factors to migration from high hills to the Terai plain land and urban areas.
"
12584,"This situation has aggra vated pressure on the limited resources available in urban and plain regions and is disturbing the equilibrium between the hills and the Terai.
"
12585,"Several of the erstwhile towns and trade centres in the hills are being deserted now. Some Past Efforts
"
12586,"As an effort to prevent environmental degradation, the environment and land use policy was incorporated for the first time as a national policy in the Sixth Plan (1980-85).
"
12587,"Subsequently, environment was recognized in the Seventh Plan (1985-1990) as an important aspect to be integrated into every development project.
"
12588,"However, the related programmes could not be implemented effectively.
"
12589,"Political commitment as well as adequate number of efficient agencies to direct, supervise, coordinate and provide consultancy services to these programmes were seriously lacking then.
"
12590,"Besides, legal provisions were inadequate and ineffective to protect and promote national natural resources.
"
12591,"Towards the end of the Seventh Plan and later, some important measures have been undertaken for the environmental protection and management.
"
12592,"In 1988, the National Conservation Strategy was formulated and approved to preserve national heritages and endowments and in 1990 the Council for the conservation of Natural & Cultural Resources was set up. Similarly, environmental preservation and management was accommodated in the Constitution of Nepal, 1991, and Nepal became a signatory to the treaty on biological diversity and climatic change at the Earth Summit held in 1992.
"
12593,"Policies
"
12594,"1. Environmental management and economic progress are related and complementary processes; hence, the  need to develop a system will take environment into account while designing and implementing development projects at central and local levels.
"
12595,"For the purpose, planning units aligned with various environments related ministries will be gradually made efficient.
"
12596,"2. At the very outset of designing projects in the areas of involving large-scale physical construction and industrial development which have the potential to upset ecology, care will be taken to incorporate such programmes that minimize the negative impact of environment.
"
12597,"3. Natural and cultural assets, traditional preservation technology and skill, etc. will be documented; the materials available in this sector will be scientifically analyzed and upgraded and bio-diversity, traditional know-how and skill will be broadened in their horizon.
"
12598,"4. Extensive legal provisions will be made and implemented for environmental management.
"
12599,"While sustainability will be taken as the top most objectiv e in formulating such legal provisions, emphasis will be laid on adopting an integrated approach in all environmental policies.
"
12600,"5. In addition to the existing condition of natural environment, air, water, noise and land-related pollution will be investigated and analyzed to prepare indicators, scales and action-oriented guidelines for their utilization.
"
12601,"Hence, the protection and promotion of environmental resources is not feasible without people's participation. That is why emphasis will be laid on disseminating awareness and information among the masses through various communication media, political agencies, elites of society and government and non-government organizations.
"
12602,"To widen environmental education, it will be incorporated formally in primary-and secondary-level curricula and informally for other people.
"
12603,"7. Necessary financial and procedural incentives will be provided for promoting voluntary initiative from the industrial sector in achieving continuity in environmental protection and utilization.
"
12604,"8. A high-level Environment Protection Council will be set up to formulate policies, give directives and establish inter-ministry coordination & monitoring related to environmental management.
"
12605,"9. The Regions already degraded or in similar process, will be surveyed and identified and plans for their rehabilitation will be designed and carried out through the concerned agencies.
"
12606,"Causes for air, water, noise and land-related pollution will be investigated through on-the-spot observation and mitigating management plans will be formulated to control pollution.
"
12607,"In this regard, emphasis will be laid on adopting technology required for minimizing solid waste and reutilizing it.
"
12608,"Special care will be taken for proper use and protection of natural and cultural resources in course of carrying out feasibility study for promoting tourism or setting up tourist spots.
"
12609,"Environmental management plan will be developed and implemented to gradually check ecological loss at the existing tourist spots.
"
12610,"Like, the policies related to environment and resource preservation, its programmes are multi-purpose and multi-f aceted. As such, these policies will be implemented through various agencies concerned with the environment and resource protection.
"
12611,"In this connection, the following will be the main programmes to be carried out. by the various agencies related to environment.
"
12612,"Institutional Development Programmes
"
12613,"1. As the management of environment is multi-faceted and requires the involvement of various organizations, it is essential to establish a balanced approach and coordination among human beings; natural resources, environment and development which will be brought into operation through the establishment of a hig h-level environment council under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.
"
12614,"The secretariat of the council will be located at the National Planning Commission.
"
12615,"4. Appropriate measures will also be adopted in monitoring and evaluation systems of examining environment-related activities.
"
12616,"5. Scientific laboratories relating to environment as well as data bank will be set up to install various data bases required in environmental management.
"
12617,"Some of the laboratories set up under different agencies will be upgraded to the national level. Environmental Impact Assessment (ETA) Programme
"
12618,"1. Guidelines for various sectoral agencies will be formulated for environmental impact assessment programme.
"
12619,"Prior to carrying out large-scale development projects (esp. road, hydro- electricity, industry, irrigation, housing, drinking water, sewerage, etc. ), priority will be given to the obligatory assessment of the environmental impact at the time of conducting their feasibility studies.
"
12620,"On the basis of these studies adequate fund will be allocated in the project budget to minimise adverse effects on the environment.
"
12621,"Provisions will also be made to monitor whether such environmental impact assessment has been made or not.
"
12622,"Programme for Identifying and Preserving Sensitive Areas
"
12623,"1. Keeping in view the environmental aspect, integrated land-use procedure will be devised.
"
12624,"Surveys and studies will be undertaken to diagnose the areas sensitive to desertification.
"
12625,"Environment-related projects will be designed and carried out for preserving and promoting the areas important from the viewpoint of  environment through the, identification of ecologically fragile areas and desert land and these projects will be implemented stagewise.
"
12626,"Conservation Programmes for Natural and Cultural Resources
"
12627,"1. Activities like collection, genetic analysis and documentation of important vegetation, endemic species and many other natural living resources will be carried out on a regular basis .
"
12628,"A report of genetic resources with future uses will be maintained and provisions will be made for in -site conservation and ex-site conservation in different parks, reserves and laboratories.
"
12629,"2. Appropriate national and sectoral guidelines will be formulated for devising environmental plans of natural and cultural spots.
"
12630,"4. Necessary research activities will be undertaken with a view to preserving and promoting useful traditional technology, skill and efficiency existing in different regions.
"
12631,"Pollution Control Programme
"
12632,"1. Studies on assessment of existing situation will be undertaken in terms of water, air, noise and soil pollution in order to control them, for which basic indices will be prepared. Action programmes involving appropriate technology will also be carried out to control pollution from various sources.
"
12633,"2. Appropriate management work plans will be made and implemented to control pollution.
"
12634,"Similarly; environment friendly land utilisation processes will be developed and put into practice.
"
12635,"Programme for Promoting People's Awareness
"
12636,"1. Environmental knowledge and practical awareness will be promoted on the basis of people's participation by carrying out publicity activities.
"
12637,"1. Environmental knowledge and practical awareness will be promoted on the basis of people's participation by carrying out publicity activities.
"
12638,"In addition, a report will be published on the existing situation of national resources.
"
12639,"2. Programmes like the incorporation of environmental education in school curricula, dissemination of environmental awareness through communication media and other programmes with NGOs' participation, e.g. environmental education, environmental health, afforestation land use, water conservation, etc.will be introduced environmental education programmes.
"
12640,"Agriculture, forest, pasture and other sectors occupy 26.5%, 42.4%, 18.8% and 19.1% of land respectively in the  recent land utilization situation in Nepal (See Appendix 1). owing to its geographical diversity ranging in altitude from less than 100 meters in the Terai to 8848 meter comprising plains, valleys, rivers and river basins, glens, alpine. upward, high hills and the Himalayas, there exist different climates and different types of farming within the same district and the same region.
"
12641,"In this perspective of land-use, it appears that the concept of dividing Nepal into the Terai Hills and Mountains on the basis of the assumptions made in the earlier plan, needs to be changed.
"
12642,"Likewise, temperature has more than 80% relation with attitude; however, there exists no such relation between rainfall and altitude; that is to say, rainfall varies at the same altitude (See Appendix 2) .
"
12643,"Bhawar, hills, high hills and Himalayan region. There appear diverse pockets in terns of rainfall, temperature, altitude and rivers in terms of irrigation. feasibility, which is the reality for Nepal's land utilization plan.
"
12644,"When we consider land's altitude, steepness, temperature, forest and arable land as a whole, we find that 27.5% of the country's total land is more than 3,000 meters above the sea-level and has limited population density and agricultural production owing to its cold climate.
"
12645,"Similarly, 13.6 percent of land is estimated to have steepness of one or a lesser degree and 58.8% land with 20 degree steepness.
"
12646,"Owing to extreme steep surface and fragile hill land, there exist problems in Nepal like landslide and erosion resulting in the decline of productivity on the one hand, while, on the other, the process of deforestation causing adverse impact on environment is continuing in the Terai whose forested la nd is considered suitable for cultivation from the viewpoint of productivity.
"
12647,"In this context, the government's past efforts have not been successful to a great extent.
"
12648,"Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems essential to formulate an extensive master plan for developing pasture, arable land, forest, settlements, urban areas, parks, and forest. This study needs to be conducted from social, political, economical, ecological and other practical perspectives.
"
12649,"Such a plan will ensure increase in productivity of limited resources and accelerate the pace of achievement and development of physical resources in rural community and eventually make substantial contribution to qualitative improvement in the living standard of most of the rural people.
"
12650,"There is unanimity about land utilization that it would be more beneficial to give priority to the maximum utilization  of agro-ecological potentials in the formulation of the plans in the near future, as there continues the predominance of agriculture in the ru ral development of Nepal.
"
12651,"Taking this into perspective, the Eighth Plan has formulated policies in consonance with the sustainable utilization of land available in the country.
"
12652,"2. In accordance with agro -ecological zone to make maximum utilization of regionwise resources on the basis of the diversity of land size and climate, production of food grains, fruit farming and livestock farming will be gradually expanded.
"
12653,"In this activity the formulation of district-level plan will have a significant role; hence, a system will be developed to formulate district development plan by preparing districtwise maps compatible with the agro ecological zone.
"
12654,"3. Regional and national agricultural research will be gradually aligned with land-ecology.
"
12655,"4. Non-agricultural land use will be discouraged within the command area of an irrigation project.
"
12656,"S. 	Measures will be undertaken to preserve the forest in Chure range and Bhawar region for controlling ecological conservation, and controlling land slide and river cuttings. Incentives will be provided for promoting community or lease hold forests in marginal land of all zones.
"
12657,"6. Priority will be given to the extension of the industry, urbanization and commercial farmings within the impact zone of roads.
"
12658,"7. Urban areas will be expanded in terms of scientific land-use planning.
"
12659,"8. As land utilization is a multi-faceted issue, coordination among various facets while framing locally suited policies and devising programmes related to the land use will be adopted as an indispensable process.
"
12660,"9. Initiatives will be undertaken towards designing a master plan in a long-term perspective to utilise the available land in the country from the view point of appropriate economic use by establishing coordination among forest, agriculture, environment and development.
"
12661,"Details about land utilization and other relevant information will be made available at both district and central levels and coordinated under the National Planning Commission.
"
12662,"In this connection, steps will be taken to update the land-use statistics of LRMP by conducting a model survey, set up computerized Geographical Information System (GIS) and strengthen Nepal Remote Sensing Centre.
"
12663,"In order to make landutilization and ecological information effective, an appropriate institutionalized system will be evolved under the National Planning Commission by means of integrating scattered units into a single whole.
"
12664,"11.
"
12665,"Necessary amendments will be made in the existing laws relating to land utilization and additional laws and rules will be framed and implemented.
"
12666,"Regional Development
"
12667,"Planned development efforts in Nepal were initiated since last three decades or more.
"
12668,"Despite some material achievements observed in some socio-economic sectors due to planned development efforts in the last few decades, it will not be an exaggeration to say that there is still a long way to sort out the inconsistencies and problems existing between resourceful and resourceless regions, rich and poor segments of the population and urban and rural communities, in a meaningful way.
"
12669,"Failure to mobilise the ever growing population outside of agriculture has compelled large number of people to extend farming even in marginal land for making a living.
"
12670,"Population growth has had adverse impact on land utilization in both hill and Terai regions.
"
12671,"Growing population, insignificant development of non-agricultural occupations and population pressure on agriculture have given rise to national problems like migration, land erosion, deforestation and unorganized settlement on the one hand, while, on the other, the Investment policy, while selecting bases for national income growth, has been confined to the development of only a few places with resources and development potential.
"
12672,"As a result, the benefits of development have not been proportionately to different regions and the country has to face problems of sorts.
"
12673,"Consequently, most of the regions and people will be alienated and the task of building a single prosperous nation will be further procrastinated. Hence, it is important to lay emphasis on the national development efforts on the basis of regional development so that the country characterized by economic backwardness and geographical diversity may achieve all-round balanced development.
"
12674,"Regional Situation
"
12675,"There is a great diversity in the status of different geographical and development regions of the country.
"
12676,"The Terai occupies 23.11% of the country's total area, whereas the hills and the mountains cover 35.21% and 41.68% of the area respectively.
"
12677,"In terms of land distribution by development regions, the largest area (22.8%) is covered by the Mid -Western Region, while the smallest area (13.3%) belongs to the Far Western Region.
"
12678,"The Western Eastern and the Central Region account for 20' , 19. 3% and 18.6% of the total area respectively.
"
12679,"The Far Western Region, geographically smallest as it is, also has lesser areas of all physiographic regions namely Tarai. hills and mountain.
"
12680,"In terms of population distribution, the Terai has the largest population, followed by the hills and then the mountains.
"
12681,"Among all regions, the Central Region is the most populated area.
"
12682,"According to the preliminary 1991 Census report, the country's population is 18.462 million of which 6.174 million (33.44%) is in the Central Region.
"
12683,"The Eastern Region, the western Region, the Mid-Western Region and the Far Western Region have 4.448 million (24.11%) , 3.752 million (20.32%), 2.406 million (13.03%) and 1.681 million (9.11%) people respectively.
"
12684,"Terai has the highest population density with lowest density in the the Mountain.
"
12685,"In terms of the development regions, the Central and the Far Western Regions have the highest and lowest population density, respectively.
"
12686,"Of the total population (18.462 million), 1.682 million people (9.11%) live -in urban areas.
"
12687,"In the census year 1991, there were 33 municipalities in the country.
"
12688,"Of them, 9 municipalities were n the Eastern Region, 13 were in the Central Region, 5 were in the Western Region and 3 each were in the Mid-Western and Far Western Region.
"
12689,"In terms of sub-regions, the hills in the Central Region and the Terai in the Eastern Region have the highest number of municipalities and the mountains of none o f the development regions have any Municipality.
"
12690,"Thus, from the perspective of urbanization, the Central Region is the most highly urbanized of all the regions.
"
12691,"As regards land utilization, 18% of Nepal's total area has had no utility at all.
"
12692,"Such land includes barren land, land-slide affected areas, pasture land, snow-covered land, etc.
"
12693,"The land utilized for different purposes constit utes 82% of the total land, of which the area utilised by human beings is 20%, and the remaining 62% of the area is left to the natural own use.
"
12694,"Agricultural land has been regarded as the land utilized by human beings. Similarly, urban areas, plantation areas are also treated in the same category.
"
12695,"As Nepal lags behind in urbanization, the area used for this purpose is estimated to be only 0.08% of the total area of the country.
"
12696,"The percentages of the total land used for agriculture are 9.3% in the mountains, 43. 1% in the hills and 47. 6% in the Terai.
"
12697,"In terms of land area distribution by development regions, the Eastern Region holds 28.2%, the central Region 26.6%, the Western Region 19.9%, the Mid-Western Region 15.3% and the Far-Wester Region holds 9.9%.
"
12698,"Forest occupies the largest area of the land categories as nature utilised. Of the total forest area (6,306,000 ha., i.e.
"
12699,"42.4%) only 37.8% has genuine forest cover and the remaining 4.6% is occupied by shrubs.
"
12700,"Development regionwise, the Mid-Western Region has the largest forest area (27.39%) followed by 21.04% in the Central Region, 18.09% in the Eastern Region, 16.83% in the Western Region and 16.65% in the Far Western Region.
"
12701,"It is estimated that about 986,898 ha of land (6.5% of the country's total area) is still available for agricultural purposes.
"
12702,"Looking at the numerical distribution of industries in Nepa7l, the central Region stands at the lead position with 47.4% of the total industries.
"
12703,"Mid and the Far-Western Region each has less than 7% of the industries.
"
12704,"As regards physical infrastructure, the Central Region again occupies a lead position in the regionwise distribution of road transport facilities.
"
12705,"The length of roads in the Mid and Far-Western Regions is considerably less. Of the 43 small/large airports in the country, viz. 43, the Eastern Region has 11 followed by 8 in the Central Region, 7 in the western Region, 9 in the Mid-Western Region and 8 in the Far Western Region.
"
12706,"As regards regionwise distribution of the postal service under the communication sector, there are 598 post offices in the Eastern Region, 614 in the Central Region, 486 in the Western Region, 305 in the Mid -Western Region and 258 in the Far Western Region. The regionwise split of telephone lines likewise is: 13,640 in the Eastern Region, 52,610 in the Central Region, 5,000 in the Western Region, 3,500 in the Mid-Western Region and 3,450 in the Far Western Region.
"
12707,"There are variations as well in the regionwise aistribution of social service facilities like education, health and drinking water.
"
12708,"It has been found that these services are mostly confined within the Central Region.
"
12709,"There are 22 hospitals in the Eastern Region, 40 in the Central Region, 23 in the Western Region,.and 13 each in the Mid and Far-Western Regions with 725, 2663, 724, 303 and 353 beds respectively.
"
12710,"Similarly, the distribution of health posts from the Eastern Region to the Far Western Region is 171, 216, 178, 151 and 100, respectively. moreover, Ayurvedic hospitals have also been extending health services.
"
12711,"Their regionwise distribution in the same order is 26, 42, 39, 19 and 19, respectively. As of 1990, there were 5,272 schools, 876,002 students and 22,180 teachers in the Eastern Region; 6,926 schools, 10,78,732 students and 29,301 teachers in the Central Region; 5,960 schools 880,824 students and 23,847 teachers in the Western Region; 3,458 schools, 406,436 students and 11,391 teachers in the Mid-Western Region; and 2,143 schools, 255,313 students and 7,314 teachers in the Far Western Region.
"
12712,"These figures reveal that the Central Region outnumbers other regions in terms of number of schools, students and teachers.
"
12713,"One of the major factors responsible for such a regional imbalance is the inefficiency in implementing several programmes in consonance with the regional development policies envisaged in the previous plans.
"
12714,"Ir addition, the atmosphere conducive to implement necessary programmes and projects was also lacking in the past.
"
12715,"Objectives The objectives for the regional development policy in the Eighth Plan are as follows: 1.
"
12716,"To increase regional and national production and reduce regional imbalance by Mobilizing resources and assets scattered in different parts of the country; and
"
12717,"2. To integrate rural development process with the national mainstream by improving the prevailing economic condition of I less developed rural and backward areas.
"
12718,"To achieve these objectives the regional development policies envisaged in the Eighth Plan are as given below: 1.
"
12719,"To gradually reduce the imbalance existing in interregional and sub regional socio-economic development; to develop the existing resources and means scattered in various regions and sub-regions on tire basis of regional analysis; and thereby strengthen the base of regional development.
"
12720,"2. To gear tire regional investment towards minimizing the existing regional and sub-regional Socio-economic imbalance.
"
12721,"3. To establish closest link and coordination among the existing or evolving infrastructure and facilities and production-oriented economic activities, in the context of formulating development programmes for different regions, sub-regions and districts.
"
12722,"4. To develop functional interrelationships between different regions and sub-regions and rural. and urban areas.
"
12723,"Attention will be given to the development of hierarchical settlement system.
"
12724,"5. To prepare site-profiles of regional development in order to establish appropriate functional interrelations and coordination among national, regional, sub-regional and district levels.
"
12725,"6. To take necessary steps to institutionalise the planning which determines national priority on the basis of regional and sub-regional plans.
"
12726,"7. To implement regional development plans in line with the decentralization policy.
"
12727,"8. To lay special emphasis on the development of internal, transport system appropriate from transit perspective.
"
12728,"9. To pay attention to environmental conservation and promotion while utilizing arid mobilizing regional resources and endowments.
"
12729,"To precisely determine the means and resources required to devise the model of regional investment for accelerated pace of development.
"
12730,"To take necessary steps towards developing urban areas on a planned basis at suitable locations along the Mahendra Highway and North-South link roads in the context of growing pressure of urbanization and to promote small town developments in other suitable areas with a view to support the rural development.
"
12731,"To determine appropriate distance to service centres or units in terms of command area with a view to provide necessary services to the rural communities and to carry out welfare programmes for underdeveloped areas and backward communities. 13.
"
12732,"To formulate and implement land utilization plan by adopting appropriate strategy to be adopted at regional, sub-regional and local levels so as to make proper utilization of local means and resources including the maintenance of ecological balance.
"
12733,"To enable the offices of development-related ministries and departments in each development region to formulate, implement, coordinate, monitor and evaluate development programmes.
"
12734,"15. To seek greater and direct involvement of NGOs and national-level organizations and agencies with due consideration to their scope of activities in regional development programmes.
"
12735,"Decentralisation
"
12736,"Definition
"
12737,"Decentralisation implies a transfer of authority and responsibility from a higher level of a hierarchy to a lower level.
"
12738,"Since the majority of the Nepalese people live in the rural areas, it is but natural for development works to begin from the village level. This, in fact, underlies the basic principle of decentralisation.
"
12739,"The policy of decentralisation, therefore, implies the process for transferring authority and responsibility to local bodies in the formulation, implementation and effective management of development plans and projects with active participation of the local people. The process of decentralisation in this way attempts to integrate development plans with a more supportive role of the local organisations.
"
12740,"Major Theoretical Aspects of Decentralisation
"
12741,"The effective involvement of the people in development activities will depend largely on clear and simple guidelines, together with the institutional development of local organizations based on motivation, honesty and democratic principles.
"
12742,"The general public need to be mobilized for participation in local development so that they can learn and benefit from their own experiences.
"
12743,"Towards this end, His Majesty's Government will allow the people to implement programmes at their own pace. The system of decentralisation that the parliamentary government seeks to establish is based on such close collaboration between the people and the government. Background
"
12744,"The decentralisation system will provided opportunities to the people to make their own decisions on the development needs of their areas.
"
12745,"The new Constitution of Nepal has also made legal provisions for basic human rights and democratic freedom. The laws enacted in 1991 have specified the organisation and functions of local bodies at the district, municipal and village levels.
"
12746,"However, the relationship between the central government and the local bodies is yet to be defined clearly.
"
12747,"The present policy on decentralisation has been prepared to clarify this essential function. Two faulty practices relating to local development that were prevalent during the Panchayat regime remain to be reformed.
"
12748,"They are, (1) a highly centralized system of administration where higher level decisions are imposed on the lower level, and (2) the lack of commitment and responsibility in carrying out official tasks.
"
12749,"These weaknesses have been reinforced by political leaders, carried out by bureaucrats and encouraged by foreign aid.
"
12750,"Political decentralization has now been recognized as the best means for removing these two obstacles to development.
"
12751,"In implementing this process of decentralisation, public participation will be sought in various development programmes including poverty alleviation, reduction in environmental degradation and rapid economic development. Decentralization in this way goes beyond the concept of formal government and involves the freeing of local non-governmental and private organisations as well.
"
12752,"The role of government therefore is not to dictate but to support the development activities of non governmental organizations.
"
12753,"Objectives of the Decentralization Policy
"
12754,"1. All citizens of the country should have the freedom to organise themselves to implement development plans.
"
12755,"The main aim of the decentralization policy is to support and assist all development activities implemented by the people at their own initiative and to seek to develop the local government as well as non -government organizations involved in such activities.
"
12756,"2. The economically viable development activities need to be directly beneficial to the people, and as for as possible such activities should be initiated by the people themselves.
"
12757,"The second aim of this policy is, therefore, to make the government officials and decision makers (local politicians) responsible for providing essential support and services to public organizations engaged in development activities directly accountable and answerable to the people themselves.
"
12758,"3. All transactions relating to development must be carried out with honesty and fairness.
"
12759,"The third aim of the policy is thus, to increase public trust in local political institutions by maintaining accuracy and transparency of their financial records relating to development works.
"
12760,"Basic Policy
"
12761,"As indicated above, the most effective way of increasing development activities and cost efficiency is to encourage local organizations to set priorities and implement projects prepared to fulfill local needs.
"
12762,"However, the issue of local autonomy versus central control has been raised on different occasions.
"
12763,"These aspects are not always taken into account when preparing programmes for development. .
"
12764,"'This policy will focus mainly on the rights and responsibilities of local government agencies and matters relating to direct involvement of the local people.
"
12765,"1. Plan Formulation and Implementation
"
12766,"The local autonomous bodies, established under the laws governing local development (such as Village Development Committee Act, Municipality Act, District Development Committee Act) , will be given complete freedom of operation.
"
12767,"The elected representatives of the District Development Committee will be responsible for all activities related to the social and economic development of the District.
"
12768,"Similarly, the elected representatives of the municipality will co-ordinate the programmes implemented within the municipal area and maintain contact with the District Development Committee for all district-level programmes.
"
12769,"The elected representatives of the Village Development Committee will also be responsible for implementing and co-ordinating the programmes within the village area.
"
12770,"In matters of local development, HMG will only have a supportive role of monitoring, supervision and co-ordination.
"
12771,"In this context, the non-government organizations and the private sector will be encouraged to provide their services for productive purposes.
"
12772,"The central government will accordingly assist and inspire the local people to make decisions that can be effective in implementing local development programmes. This will be the basis for the central government assistance to local development.
"
12773,"A local-level project that is implemented either with foreign assistance or with HMG funds will be classified as a local level project if this can be implemented by local agencies or is not of national importance.
"
12774,"Any district-level project that is implemented within one or more districts will also be classified as a local level project.
"
12775,"HMG will provide necessary assistance to promote district-level co-operative efforts in development.
"
12776,"If a local development project requires an international tender for its implementation, the tender will be issued at the central level but the project will still be recognized as a local level project.
"
12777,"The local-level government offices involved in implementing the district or municipal-level projects will be accountable to the District Development Committee or the municipality.
"
12778,"All local development activities run by these offices will be under the supervision of the District Development Committee and the municipality.
"
12779,"In case the District Development Committee, the Municipality or the Village Development Committee requires technical assistance for development works, they can arrange this through direct contract systems. 2. Control of Local and Central Investments through Local Budgets
"
12780,"It is possible to increase implementation capacity, encourage leadership and increase productivity through greater public participation if the local political leadership is directly and fully responsible to people.
"
12781,"The right to make decisions on local-level development expenditure is a basic factor of local autonomy in a decentralized system.
"
12782,"All the authority relating to local budgeting, accounting and personnel will be entrusted to the District Development Committee, Village Development Committee and the Municipality within the next two years.
"
12783,"Necessary amendments will be made in the pre sent laws to implement these provisions.
"
12784,"The central government will continue to provide grants and loans to support local development projects.
"
12785,"The development grants will be made available in the following ways.
"
12786,"A Local Development Fund will be established to provide block grants to local agencies for the development of districts, towns or villages.
"
12787,"Apart from the provision that no part of the grant may be spent for administrative purposes, HMG will not specify any other condition on how the money is to b e used.
"
12788,"This fund will be operated by the Ministry of Finance and the money will be transferred directly to local bodies without government intermediary agencies.
"
12789,"The funds set up for specific purposes will be used to implement only the specific projects.
"
12790,"The guidelines for the use of money by the local bodies will be issued by the concerned central body with the advice of the National Planning commission and the Ministry of Finance.
"
12791,"The use of such funds may not be limited only to local government agencies.
"
12792,"This fund can also be made available to non-governmental organizations operating at the local level.
"
12793,"3. Use of Revenue Realised from Local Tax or Duty
"
12794,"The people living in towns and villages need to have sources of revenue in order to be independent of the central government.
"
12795,"The municipalities and the Village Development Committees will be allowed to retain revenue raised by them to meet local needs, and to carry out local development projects. The taxes raised from the local people for services and use of resources will be used to operate expand and maintain local facilities.
"
12796,"The statement of accounts will be open to public inspection, and a provision will be made for a central agency to audit the accounts at any time.
"
12797,"4. Conditions on Sanction of Grants
"
12798,"The grants provided to the local agencies by the centre need to be related to the increment of revenue at the efforts made for the local level.
"
12799,"The central grant will, thus, need to be regulated according to the local capacity to raise revenue.
"
12800,"This is known as matching grant concept.. An appropriate policy will be formulated to ensure that the remote rural areas with less population and resources will receive the necessary grants.
"
12801,"HMG will also make regular monitoring on how the central grant and the lo cal revenue are being used.
"
12802,"The local agencies which make proper use of local resources and management will be provided with higher grant amounts.
"
12803,"Besides the auditing of accounts, arrangements will be made for on-the-spot inspection of projects, and the facts obtained from such inspection will be made available to the general public.
"
12804,"The foreign donor agencies that provide aid for local development purposes will be encouraged to contribute grants directly to local agencies rather than through ministries or other government departments.
"
12805,"This arrangement will provide further incentive to local agencies including the non-government and private agencies to prepare and implement development programmes more effectively.
"
12806,"5. Implementation of Central Government Programmes in Local Areas
"
12807,"The Central Government must cease to control the implementation of local development programmes.
"
12808,"The Ministries and Departments at the central level have enough work of their own. A programme implemented at the national level is, however, the sole responsibility of the concerned Ministry. such national projects may include national level roads such as, East-West Highway, large-scale hydroelectric projects, central telecommunication network, etc.
"
12809,"The majority of the sectoral programmes included in the Eighth Plan are national-level projects.
"
12810,"Before implementing these projects, the Ministries concerned are expected to formulate implementation plans and provide guidelines and necessary support to local agencies at the District, Municipal and Village levels.
"
12811,"A local development project, however, cannot be confined to local needs and aspirations.
"
12812,"The planning for such a project should take into account the need for coordination between central policy and local needs.
"
12813,"The use and management of material resources provided by the Centre will not be in the form of centrally managed project but will be the responsibility of the local agencies.
"
12814,"The centre will also provide technical assistance for a more effective use of these materials.
"
12815,"Integrated development needs to be viewed as an essential working principle of the decentralization process.
"
12816,"The national-level projects as well as the local development programmes will be regarded as mutual ly-supportive in the overall development of the districts, towns and villages.
"
12817,"The agency which prepares and implements a central-level project will maintain close contact with the local agencies during the course of its implementation.
"
12818,"In case a local programme is contrary to the aims of the central project, the problem will be resolved through evaluation and mutual discussions.
"
12819,"6. The Organization and Functions of the users, Committee
"
12820,"The locally elected representatives will encourage the local people to organize users committees, co-operative societies and othe r such organizations to fulfil the local development objectives.
"
12821,"In this way the elected representatives and the political leaders can focus attention on how such organizations can contribute to local development. the practice of controlling these organizations by influential persons by taking the leadership or employing their own people or by any other means will be discouraged.
"
12822,"If the users' committees are able to formulate and implement development programmes on their own without external financial assis tance, they will be allowed to do so.
"
12823,"These committees or other agencies will be free to seek technical assistance from government organizations or other sources.
"
12824,"The users' committees should concentrate on such development works that require only a little or no external assistance. Any external assistance, if required or available, will not require to be channelized to them through the centre.
"
12825,"Organization of Users Committee representing the interest of the local people will be encouraged so that everyone can benefit from services such as good education, community health services, social and cultural activities, local roads, bridges, drinkingwater and other physical infrastructure for development.
"
12826,"All users of the particular service will have to contribute for the operation and maintenance of the service.
"
12827,"This Users' Committee will be given the authority and the responsibility to implement relevant programmes.
"
12828,"The District Officers will provide necessary support to the Committees and be accountable to them, but they will not in any way control or interfere their programme activities.
"
12829,"The Users' Committees will not be politicized.
"
12830,"The membership to the Committee will not be based on the political alliance of the members.
"
12831,"No person can be a Chairman of more than one Users' Committee at the same time, and a member of the Committee must be a resident of the area and one who enjoys the services provided by the said Committee.
"
12832,"7. Decentralisation and the Role of Non-governmental Organizations and the Private Sector
"
12833,"The local agencies and Users' Committees need to be provided organizational and technical assistance for implementing development activities.
"
12834,"They would also need the services of wholesalers, retailers, private firms and other financial institutions for the procurement of essential commodities and the sale of their products.
"
12835,"If the local-level or -regional-level line Ministry offices are unable to provide the required services, the local bodies will advise the Users' Committee to seek assistance from nongovernmental organizations.
"
12836,"Arrangements will be made for a nongovernmental organization or the private sector and the Users' Committee to enter into contracts system, the use of volunteer service and other management services.
"
12837,"The local bodies also need to maintain close contacts with the private sector by exchange of necessary information.
"
12838,"In addition to this, the private firms will be encouraged to implement essential economic programmes that would promote balanced economic development of the country.
"
12839,"8. Programme to Increase Efficiency of Local Bodies
"
12840,"The main thrust of decentralisation is to upgrade the working capacity of local bodies under the leadership of local representatives.
"
12841,"If the local bodies can develop a greater sense of responsibility through training of their members, the trust of the people and their participation can increase.
"
12842,"The commitment to local development can be developed only through necessary reforms in the administrative and management systems.
"
12843,"It is necessary to provide training to the locally elected representatives, the officials of the Users' Committee and the local people on how development programmes are to be implemented under a decentralised system.
"
12844,"Various conferences, seminars and training programs will be organized in the districts to improve efficiency and work skills.
"
12845,"Seminars and workshops of elected representatives of districts, to ' wns and villages will be made more effective and compatible with decentralization policy.
"
12846,"While formulating the training programmes for the local bodies, attempts will be made to have maximum participation of the concerned bodies in the choice of subjects and methods.
"
12847,"In the past, the normal practice was to rely more on unproductive development speeches rather than on teaching of practical skills.
"
12848,"While organizing training programmes for the local people associated with users groups, attention will be paid to their needs and reasonable financial and other incentives will also be provided.
"
12849,"In the remote areas where most members of the Users' Committee may not be aware of the new concepts, preliminary seminars and workshops will I initially deal with known and simple work systems and then gradually cover higher level subject matters.
"
12850,"Prices
"
12851,"Background
"
12852,"As the majority of the Nepalese people have low levels of income, it is essential to raise their living standards by controlling undue increase in prices.
"
12853,"Toward this end, the national saving rate should increase so as to channelise it in the production sector. However, in the context of the country's present economic situation, in order to implement the plan in the country, most of' the development projects expenditures have to be financed by taking foreign loans and grants.
"
12854,"This has increased the net foreign assets and the money supply on the one hand and on the other hand, the high rate of increase in the loans to the government and the private sectors from the banking sector has also helped to increase the monetary expansion.
"
12855,"Moreover, the rate of inflation has been increasing continuously due to slow increase in the production of the essential commodities in relation to increase in the money supply.
"
12856,"In order to address this situation, the Eighth Plan has adopted policies to maintain a balance between demand and supply by increasing production and productivity.
"
12857,"Nepal being a small land-locked country and as it has to depend on foreign trade for its economic development, the international and particularly, the Indian inflation rate has direct or indirect impact on its inflation rate.
"
12858,"Nepal's price situation needs to be observed in this context.
"
12859,"Progress during the Seventh Plan
"
12860,"During the Seventh Plan (fiscal year 1985/86 to 1989/90), there was a great pressure on the price level.
"
12861,"In the first year of this plan, the national urban consumer price index was increased by 15.8 percent.
"
12862,"The internal causes for this high rate of price increment was due to the devaluation of the Nepalese currency by 14.7 percent, the high rate of increase in the money supply, gradual increase in the prices of goods and services produced by the government enterprises and private sectors; and an increase in tariffs, sales taxes and excise duties, etc.
"
12863,"In the same way, the increase in the price level in the international market and particularly in India put a great pressure on the price level in the Seventh Plan period.
"
12864,"Price Situation during the Interim Year
"
12865,"After the completion of the Seventh Plan in 1989/90, the following two fiscal years; 1990/91 and 1991/92 were the years of plan holidays.
"
12866,"After the collapse of Panchayat System and the establishment of a democratic government in the month of April,1990, the improvement in the relation between Nepal and India made a favourable impact on the price situation which made the country able to maintain the inflation rate at 9.8 percent in the fiscal year 1990/91. The inflation rate, however, increased to 21.1 percent during the fiscal year 1991/92.
"
12867,"The causes of this high rate of inflation was due to the devaluation of the Nepalese currency against other convertible currencies by 20.9 percent during the last week of June 1991, the increase in the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods imported from the third countries following the adoption of partial convertibility of Nepalese currency with other convertible foreign currencies in the month of February,1992, decrease in agriculture production due to unfavourable monsoon, and price increases in goods and services produced by government and private sectors industries, etc.
"
12868,"An increase of small percentage in the price level is warranted in the course of the country's economic development.
"
12869,"However, an undue rise in the price level will have an adverse effect on the country's economic development. Considering the possible negative effects on the economic development of the country in either condition, the rise and fall in prices must be limited to a certain extent.
"
12870,"Price policies in the Eighth Plan will be as follows:
"
12871,"1. In keeping with liberal policies designed to encourage development in the economic sector, pressure on prices will be minimised by involving the private sector in production and distribution system.
"
12872,"2. Line ministries will ma ke a listing of daily consumer essentials in order to facilitate regularity in the supply of domestic produce and imported items (such as rice, pulses, spices, sugar, milk, salt and kerosene, etc.).
"
12873,"Line ministries will also develop reliable statistics relating to domestic production, demand, surplus/deficit of the listed items and partial or full import requirements.
"
12874,"On the basis of such statistics, policies will be adopted to maintain prices at desired levels by ensuring regularity in the supply management of necessary goods.
"
12875,"3. In previous years, the export of domestic essential produce (such as rice, wheat, oilseeds, etc.) was restricted. But these items were smuggled out of the country due to the lack of a control mechanism along the border.
"
12876,"The government will observe tight controls in border areas to discourage unauthorised trade.
"
12877,"But the domestic transit of local and imported product will not be restricted as such a move could hinder supply management.
"
12878,"4. Stock ceilings will be enforced among mill owners, wholesale and retail traders to break the present monopoly of large traders in the foodgrain trade. To roster a liberal economy, a competitive atmosphere will be created where cooperatives and the private sector will be involved to the maximum possible extent in the trade of essential commodities.
"
12879,"5. In order to relieve the general public from hardship by maintaining regularity, the Nepal Food Corporation will build adequate stocks of essential foodstuffs. When prices rise above desired levels, the corporation will intervene in the market to check prices.
"
12880,"The role of Nepal Food Corporation in the supply of essential commodities to remote areas will be further intensified in light of' the small number of private sector entrepreneurs willing to undertake the job,
"
12881,"6. The practice of giving subsidies by the government to recover losses incurred while fixing the prices of goods by the government such as foodgrains, chemical fertilizers and petroleum products will be gradually eliminated In order to roster favourable effects on prices through the healthy and competitive involvement of' the private sector and cooperatives, the monopoly of public enterprises in the import and distribution of these goods will be discontinued.
"
12882,"7. As the expansion in money supply has also contributed to price rises in the past, the rate of expansion in money supply will be kept within limits, in consideration of economic stability.
"
12883,"8. As recurring government budget deficits were among the main reasons behind the rapid expansion of money supply, attempts will be made in the coming years to keep budgetary deficits within stipulated limits.
"
12884,"9. While efforts will be made to ensure regularity in supply management to increase internal production, policies will be adopted to import deficit items from cheapest possible sources.
"
12885,"Measures will also be introduced to eliminate differences in import prices arising from varied rates if) customs tariff.
"
12886,"10. The price level will not be allowed to increase beyond 9.0 percent on an average during the plan period.
"
12887,"Financial Resource Mobilisation
"
12888,"The policy of financial resource mobilisation has an important role in achieving the objectives envisaged by the Eighth Plan.
"
12889,"To achieve these objectives, the increase in share of investment in Gross Domestic Product of the economy is needed.
"
12890,"In addition, it is equally necessary that the investment structure also takes a directional change favourable to the economic and social development efforts of the country.
"
12891,"Furthermore, in the context of the liberal economic policy adopted by the nation, the formulation of a policy on financial resource mobilisation has become necessary to orient the available government and non-government sector's economic resources towards right direction.
"
12892,"The mobilisation of financial resources with due attention to the interrelationships among various macro-economic policies for the maximum utilisation of' the opportunities of development generated by the liberal economic policy and an increase in the Gross Domestic Saving rate in the economy have become necessary for development.
"
12893,"This policy has been formulated taking these facts into consideration.
"
12894,"Existing Challenges
"
12895,"Although the Seventh Plan (1984/85 - 1989/90) had stressed on resource mobilisation for increasing investment, it failed to achieve the targeted progress.
"
12896,"This led to the emergence of the following problems in the mobilisation of the resources.
"
12897,"Deficit Gross Revenue Mobilisation: Nepal joined the rank of those countries which mobilises low total revenue in the share of' the Gross Domestic Product.
"
12898,"In the fiscal year 1984/85 the tax revenue constituted 7.1 percent and the non-tax revenue 1.7 percent and thus, the total revenue comprised 8.8 percent of the GDP In the fiscal year 1989/90, the share of total revenue in the GDP reached 10.2 percent with the tax revenue contributing 8.0 percent. and the non-tax revenue 2.2 percent.
"
12899,"In the same way the revised estimate for 1991/92 shows the total revenue will stand at 10.2 percent with tax revenue contributing 7.7 percent and non-tax revenue 2.5 percent.
"
12900,"This situation evidently vindicates the need for increasing the quantity of the mobilisation of the revenue.
"
12901,"Increase in Regular Expenditure: The regular expenditure has shown an excessive growth in total government expenditure.
"
12902,"In 1984/85, the share of the regular expenditure in the GDP was 6.5 percent, which increased to 7.3 percent in 1989/90.
"
12903,"In the fiscal year 1991/92, the revised estimate of this expenditure is 7.4 percent, This increase in regular expenditure stalled any possible positive impact on revenue savings.
"
12904,"The revenue savings stood at 2.3 percent of GDP in 1984/85, which remained at 2.9 percent in 1989/90.
"
12905,"In the fiscal year 1991/92, the revised estimate for this savings is 2.8 percent of the GDP.
"
12906,"Thus, without changing the present revenue savings ratio, there exist few possibilities to bring about any favourable changes in the government financial position.
"
12907,"Dependence on Deficit Finance Mobilisation: Because of the absence of desirable changes in the revenue savings, the deficit finance mobilisation has emerged as a permanent mechanism of resource mobilisation to general resources for the growing development expenditure.
"
12908,"The share of deficit finance in GDP was 4.1 percent in 1984/85 and it remained at 2.7 percent in 1989/90.
"
12909,"The revised estimate of this share in 1991/92 is 1.0 percent.
"
12910,"Thus, the deficit finance mobilisation has shown a declining tendency. However, if enough resources are not mobilized through revenue and foreign assistance, the government's dependence on deficit finance will remain a characteristic feature.
"
12911,"Thus, it appears that the deficit finance had exerted lower pressure on the non -banking sector than on the banking sector in the past, which clearly indicates the prevalence of a situation of an undesirable competition between the government and private sectors. Increased Reliance on External Resources:
"
12912,"Because of the insufficiency of internal resource mobilisation, the reliance on external resources for financing the development expenditures grew heavily.
"
12913,"In 1984/85, while the foreign assistance contributed 48.8 percent to the total development expenditure, this contribution increased to 61.1 percent in 1989/90.
"
12914,"The share of foreign assistance it development expenditure decreased to 52.7 percent in 1990/91, but it will be salutary to further decrease its share in the years to come.
"
12915,"It is certainly not desirable to depend excessively on foreign assistance for our development efforts.
"
12916,"Disparity between Foreign Assistance and Utilisation: In the foreign esources front, the disparity between foreign assistance commitments and its actual utilisation has become a matter of concern.
"
12917,"The actual utilisation of foreign assistance in 1984/85 stood at 44.7 percent of the commitments, which decreased to 40.7 percent in 1989/901. Thus, the deficiency in the absorptive capacity has emerged as a problem than the insufficiency in the external resource mobilisation.
"
12918,"Predominance of Loans in Total Foreign Assistance: During the Seventh Plan period, the loans had a predominant share in the total foreign assistance.
"
12919,"The share of loans in foreign assistance in 1984/85 stood at 65.5 percent, which further increased to 72.0 percent in 1989/90.
"
12920,"In the fiscal year 1990/91, this share went upto 77.8 percent.
"
12921,"This situation has clearly enunciated the fact that a proper utilisation of available resources needs to be emphasized as much as the scarch for the additional resources while formulating resource mobilisation policy.
"
12922,"There are various factirs that have contributed to the emergence of these tendencies it) ,overnment. financial position.
"
12923,"The main problems include the lack of timely and procedural reforms in the prevailing revenue regime, revenue pilferage allegedly occurring in large amounts, Darrow revenue bases lack of training and skills anion.- employee.,;, low flexibility in revenue regime failure to use the external resources fully,etc.
"
12924,"These problems will be gradually removed and ill order to generate revenue for maintaining a high and sustainable rate of investment the following additional resource mobilisation policies will be adopted during file Eighth Plan period. Objectives:
"
12925,"The main objectives of the resource mobilization policy it) the Eighth Plan will he the followings: 1 .
"
12926,"To assist in increasing the Gross Dome stic Saving Rate by changing the unnecessary and inappropriate consumption patterns 2. To create a conducive atmosphere for channelling the investment to productive sectors by raising the total investment growth rate by 3.0 percentage points during the plan period.
"
12927,"3. To avail regular Supply of financial resources ill required quantity in order to carry oil with development activities in kit) uninterrupted and sustainable manner
"
12928,"4. TO Make efforts for efficient mobilization of internal resources and to make appropriate and optimum utilisation of foreign assistance.
"
12929,"5. To utilise the internal and external resources in a complementary perspective taking their interrelationships into consideration.
"
12930,"These objectives have been taken into account In tile formulation Of the policy of fanancial resouree mobilisation, Which encompasses the mobilisation of both internal and external resources.
"
12931,"Policy Based Programmes 1 	Internal Re-source Mobilisation:
"
12932,"The mobilisation of internal resources will be emphasized for meeting the need of' increased investment for development works and for gradually replacing the foreign assistance.
"
12933,"The following special efforts will be made to bring about a structural change in the internal resource mobilization.
"
12934,"On the one hand, new measure s of resource mobilisation will be adopted and, on the other, appropriate changes will be brought about in the prevailing revenue regime To raise the share of revenue in GDP, the revenue will be increased by 2.5 percentage points during the plan period, thus raising the share of revenue in GDP to 13.4 percent For this, both tax and non-tax revenue sources will be used to the maximum extent.
"
12935,"(a) In the tax revenue front, the tax system will be made simple and extensive by making appropriate changes in the structure ol the tax system.
"
12936,"The local and central level taxes will be clearly defined in the plan period.
"
12937,"(b) 	By reviewing the purposes of various taxes, any vague and multi faceted purposes will be replaced by one purpose for one specific tax.
"
12938,"(c) 	In the context of the agriculture sector not having been brought within the domain of the tax regime, an appropriate tax system will be developed and implemented with the objective of commercialising the agriculture sector.
"
12939,"(d) 	With a view to promoting the sales tax as a revenue base lot resource mobilisation by merging several prevailing taxes with it, it will be eventually developed into value added lax.
"
12940,"(e) 	While excise duty will be limited to some specific items the excise system will be modified in keeping wit h the liberal economic policies adopted by the government.
"
12941,"However, the foreign assistance utilisation figure of 1990/91 has exceeded the approved mounts. This is to he considered as all exeeption it, view of the inclusion of the previously utilized amounts into the figures for 1990/91.
"
12942,"(I) 	Extensive reforms will he made in customs to bring about uniformity in tariff' rat"" and necessary arrangements will be made to bring the tariff system in line with international conventions.
"
12943,"(g) 	The prevailing income tax rates will be reformed, simplified and extended. (h) 	Land revenue will be reviewed and gradually developed as a local resource.
"
12944,"(i) 	Wealth tax will be further refined and made more practical in line with social justice.
"
12945,"(j) 	Reforms will be made in revenue administration.
"
12946,"Organizing a separate administrative set-up in the revenue sector, it will be made more scientific, efficient and effective.
"
12947,"Simplification, clarity, transparency and efficacy will be infused into the tax and non-tax administration.
"
12948,"At the same time, necessary measures will be adopted to minimize revenue pilferage.
"
12949,"Training programmes will be conducted to strengthen the revenue administration and make it more efficient.
"
12950,"At the same time, the organisational structures of administrative agencies will be further strengthened and necessary studies and reviews will be conducted.
"
12951,"These changes will impart more flexibility to the revenue structure and especially to the taxation system and augment revenue collection.
"
12952,"At the same time, these measures will contribute to production growth by encouraging the private sector savings and investments.
"
12953,"These arrangements will increase the share of direct taxes in the total tax revenue collection, which is expected to bring about sustainability in the mobilisation of internal resources by reorienting revenue collection presently based heavily on external trade towards internal production.
"
12954,"The non-tax revenue includes the income from the selling of government goods and services, profit, principal and interest.
"
12955,"Prices of such goods and services will be fixed in accordance with the cost of production and by maintaining quality standards of these goods and services.
"
12956,"Such services will be extended on the basis of their investment cost and their rates will be reviewed periodically.
"
12957,"2. External Resource Mobilisation
"
12958,"2.1 	Emphasis will be laid on maximum increase in the utilization or productivity of resources obtained from external sources.
"
12959,"2.2 	Special efforts will be made to utilise the available resources as the inability to utilise them has been a bigger problem than the mobilisation of additional external resources.
"
12960,"2.3 	Foreign loan assistance will be drawn only for areas accorded priority by government and the role of government will remain dominant in the formulation and execution of such projects. The preference for the services of foreign consultants will be modified to develop a trend to use the services of Nepalese professionals as far as possible.
"
12961,"2.4 	The selection of projects for external assistance will be made in specific areas identified by the plan in terms of priority.
"
12962,"2.5 	Foreign loans will be approved only for productive programmes and for other programmes external grants will be mobilised as far as possible.
"
12963,"2.6 	Commercial loans will not be accepted in normal circumstances. they may be accepted only in exceptional situations depending on the nature of the project.
"
12964,"2.7 	Necessary arrangements will be made for the private sector, if it seeks to mobilise foreign loan investment at its own liability.
"
12965,"2.8 	Provisions will be made to avoid duplication and to increase the utility of assistance received from international organisations by allowing its use with the participation of the private sector or through other organisations only in areas specified by the plan.
"
12966,"2.9 	Special attention will be paid to subjectwise and countrywise reconciliation of the foreign assistance in order to ensure the initiation and completion of the foreign aided projects according to the programmes fixed in advance.
"
12967,"The existing system of aid consortium will be utilised to the maximum to mobilise the aid commitments from international agencies and foreign countries in a coordinated fashion.
"
12968,"2.10 	An estimation of the internal and external resources will be made for three years for the main projects being operated under foreign assistance to eliminate the disparity between the available external resources and their utilization.
"
12969,"Efforts will, thus, be made to prevent the implementation of projects from being adversely affected by the scarcity of resources by ensuring the availability of both external and internal resources in adequate quantities in advance.
"
12970,"The above mentioned policy based programmes will contribute substantially to achieve a sustainable growth rate in economy during the Eighth Plan by facilitating the effective utilisation of external resources.
"
12971,"Money, Banking and Credit
"
12972,"Monetary and credit management aspects have their own peculiar significance in the macro-economic management.
"
12973,"In monetary management system , on the one hand, there is a need to orient the quantity of money supply in accordance with the actual demand of the economy on regular basis. On the other hand, the flow of financial resources in credit management system cannot be left to the discretion of commercial banks and financial institutions, it is also necessary to direct the flow of these resources in greater quantities to the socially debilitated but productive and priority-accorded sectors.
"
12974,"In the context of Nepal having adopted an open economy, an excessive level of liquidity will initially exert pressure on the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserve and subsequently cause adverse effects on the domestic price situation. Thus, it will be necessary to maintain a balanced monetary position to attain the economic growth rate envisaged in the plan.
"
12975,"The sustainable economic growth can only be achieved if the monetary balance is maintained.
"
12976,"Another important objective of monetary management is to achieve maximum mobilisation of internal resources.
"
12977,"The monetary policy needs to be oriented towards encouraging the people to save through the creation of a competitive environment among banks and financial institutions and motivating the desirous entrepreneurs to mobilise the available resources through the collection of' the scattered savings in production and employment generating programme in the country.
"
12978,"In this perspective, it is necessary along with a planned process of economic development to initiate programmes that can create new financial bases for the economy, consolidate the existing ones and encourage healthy competition.
"
12979,"A review of the requirements and availability of resources reveals that there is a tremendous resource gap between resource requirements arid its availability in the country; this is indeed indicative of the fact that a large share of private savings is still lying outside the domain of institutional systems, In this context, an efficient mobilisation of internal resources can further enhance the participation of the private sector in the economic development of the nation.
"
12980,"Current Challenges in the Monetary Sector
"
12981,"It is necessary to Control the rate of monetary expansion in harmony with the development of' the real sector in order to maintain internal and external balance in the economy but. this has not, been achieved as yet The main factors contributing to the Prevalence Of this Situation are (a) failure to minimize the role of' the government, (b) continued increase in net, foreign assets leading to increase in liquidity, (c) failure to enhance resource mobilization by banks and institution it) a warranyed manner, (d) the position of the money market and the scarcity of alternative monetary tools, (e) lack of dynamism in the capital market, and (f) the absence of a competitive environment.
"
12982,"Over the recent years, there were some efforts made to prevent the government sector from becoming a cause for monetary expansion by gradually limiting its role but there has not been any significant decline in the government role except in a very few instances.
"
12983,"The present government has adopted the policy of limiting the role of the government gradually to prevent it from causing monetary expansion and developing the private sector as the backbone of the economy. In this context, it is incumbent upon HMG to observe strict monetary discipline.
"
12984,"The continued growth in net foreign exchange assets and the subsequent liquidity generated by this have become the main factors causing monetary expansion.
"
12985,"There have not developed any effective measures to counteract the adverse impact of the above mentioned growth on monetary liquidity.
"
12986,"The central bank can issue or sell government treasury bills or Nepal Rastra Bank bonds under its ownership in order to control the monetary expansion created by the increased foreign exchange reserve. However, this measure also does not seem to be easily attainable in the context of the extent of security and the limited demand for the securities.
"
12987,"It is the repayment of long term external loans and the adoption of a flexible import policy that can possibly remedy this adverse effect of increased reserve.
"
12988,"However, this requires the identification of an appropriate level of foreign exchange reserve.
"
12989,"One of the main reasons behind the failure to achieve monetary stability is the lack of warranted increase in mobilisation of internal resources by banks and financial institutions.
"
12990,"With the objective of enhancing the efficiency of capital through healthy competition among financial institutions and thus achieving maximum utilization of internal resources, the Nepal Rastra Bank gradually liberalised the bank's interest rates and allowed full autonomy in this respect in August, 1989.
"
12991,"This policy of independent interest rates was expected to reduce the disparity between deposits and credit through an increased rate of interest on the deposits but this, too, did not materialise.
"
12992,"Consequently, the Nepal Rastra Bank adopted an increment of 2 percentage points in the bank rate for the commercial banks to adopt an expensive monetary policy. The implementation of this policy also could not raise the interest rates as expected.
"
12993,"The existing banks and financial institutions in the country have not been able to undertake the functions of mobilising the deposits, increasing the flow of credit disbursement by identifying potential sectors for investments, developing new saving schemes, and creating a favourable environment to win the confidence of the general public in the banking system.
"
12994,"Consequently, the banking sector has not been able to develop a profound financial intensity.
"
12995,"A greater proportion of financial assets in Gross National Income alone can ensure the efficacy of monetary policies, and in this context, it is essential for the banks and financial institutions to create an atmosphere conducive to financial development.
"
12996,"Other factors preventing the monetary development and stability are the preliminary stage of the money market and the lack of proper monetary tools.
"
12997,"The money market even after having traversed through a long stretch of planned economic development has remained in its rudimentary stage.
"
12998,"There exist severely limited alternative monetary instruments in the money market to facilitate the investors to make use of their savings.
"
12999,"The government treasury bills and the central bank securities are only short term investment expedients to the institutional investors.
"
13000,"The market for call money has not shown a favourable development either.
"
13001,"In this situation it has become imperative to make appropriate arrangements to develop new alternative instruments to infuse dynamism into the money market.
"
13002,"It requires a dynamic capital market to mobilise the internal resources and attain a favourable economic growth rate. Our capital market, however, is still in a preliminary stage.
"
13003,"The Security Exchange Centre has not been able to arrange any institutional brokers, nor has it been able to manage swiftly the issuance and sale of' shares and bonds of' industrial units.
"
13004,"It is primarily concentrated in operating a second market for especially government securities.
"
13005,"Consequently, the capital market has not been able to mobilise the internal resources in expected quantities.
"
13006,"The absence of requisite financial development even after a long period of planned economic development efforts can be attributed to the lack of a competitive spirit among banks and financial institutions.
"
13007,"It is necessary to develop new financial institutions, leasing companies, banks in the private sector or with joint foreign investment and other specialized agencies for the creation of a competitive environment.
"
13008,"These arrangements can develop the prerequisite infrastructure for the creation of a healthy competitive atmosphere and only then can a systematic utlisation of the savings scattered among the general public be assured.
"
13009,"The rural branches of commercial banks opened in the rural areas of Nepal do not seem to have activated their role effectively in deposit mobilisation and loan distribution.
"
13010,"In view of the contradictory situation where the ratio of a banking office and population points towards the lack of adequate number of branches of commercial banks on one hand, and the existing branches have failed to deliver results, on the other, the banking sector and credit system of ours appear to be fraught with challenges.
"
13011,"The unorganised market appears to be playing a role greater than that of the institutional market in meeting the credit needs; this situation seems to have minimised the contextual importance of interest rates and credit policies.
"
13012,"The great disparities between the interest rates of institutional and unorganised market have evidently created the existence of a dual credit system.
"
13013,"As long as this dual system continues, the efficacy of the credit system and monetary policy naturally becomes reduced.
"
13014,"To solve the above problems, it is necessary to further extend the banking system.
"
13015,"Along with establishing new branches of banks and financial institutions, the existing branches need to be properly developed and expanded.
"
13016,"By developing new monetary and fiscal tools and providing returns to these savings the financial saving should , thus, be made more attractive in comparison to investment in other unproductive assets.
"
13017,"This also requires arrangements for appropriate interest rate structure and grades, otherwise the financial savings may not grow as expected.
"
13018,"Increased financial savings alone will not be sufficient, it will be necessary to channel them to productive employment oriented sectors.
"
13019,"This again calls for proper identification of viable projects and fulfillment of an adequate loan demand of the entrepreneurs.
"
13020,"To solve this problem, it is necessary to simplify and upgrade the quality of loan distribution procedures.
"
13021,"As regards credit utilisation, the commercial banks have not been able to make available credit facilities in the priorities sectors as targeted.
"
13022,"The commercial banks have failed, in particular, to identify viable agricultural, cottage and small scale projects and attract entrepreneurs towards them.
"
13023,"However, without the promotion of such activities, the development of one of the poorest agricultural nations like Nepal does not seem to be an eventual possibility at all.
"
13024,"A healthy development of the financial sector and an additional increase in the income of the common people can create a stronger base for additional investment in development activities through the enhanced financial savings accumulated in the banks.
"
13025,"This is also one of the reasons why the commercial banks should be stronger and more capable of directing the flow of credit extension to the priority-accorded sectors.
"
13026,"It is necessary to further motivate the commercial banks towards this end.
"
13027,"The disparity between the rate of interest offered on deposits and the one charged on loans reflects the efficiency of the financial sector.
"
13028,"This disparity is of a higher degree in Nepal.
"
13029,"This has given rise to a situation where on the one hand, the deposit mobilisation has not occurred as expected and, on the other, there looms in the horizon the fear of credit facilities becoming more expensive.
"
13030,"To remedy this situation, the banks need to control their overhead costs, lighten the burden of redundant staff and render the banking activities more efficient and cost effective through the utilization of new, innovative tools and technologies.
"
13031,"It is equally important in this context to observe strict financial discipline and avoid red-tapism and procrastination in making policy decisions and in working procedures.
"
13032,"Monetary and Credit Programme in the Eighth Plan
"
13033,"In view of the significant role of the banks and financial institutions in resource mobilisation, it is absolutely a prerequisite condition to enhance the efficiency and Soundness of the banking and financial sectors.
"
13034,"The banking promotion and credit programmes of the Eighth Plan have been formulated with a view to increasing the employment opportunities the productive base of the economy- through the mobilisation of resources and consolidation of their proper utifisation.
"
13035,"1. Utilisation of Indirect Monetary Instruments
"
13036,"Nepal has now adopted a liberal economic system.
"
13037,"The banking and monetary policies also have been so trained that they reconcile with this liberal policy.
"
13038,"Accordingly the desirable standards of monetary and banking resources will be determined wit h the help of indirect instruments without, any direct interference.
"
13039,"With the objective of assisting ill the refinement of excessive liquidity observed in the economy, a liquidity proportion of 36 percent was fixed with arrangements for cash balance to be compulsorily available to the tune of 12 percent of the deposits and 24 percent of total deposits to be invested in government treasury bills or bonds issued by the central bank.
"
13040,"The provision of maintaining additional liquidity of 24 percent of deposit will be done away within the very initial Years of the Eighth Plan.
"
13041,"The monetary sector will instead accord preference to open market techniques in order to assist in the macro economic management.
"
13042,"In the event of an excessive demand for financial resources in the economy, the Nepal Rastra Bank will reduce the liquidity through the sale of treasury bills or bonds issued by His Majesty's Government or the bank itself.
"
13043,"The Nepal Rastra bank when bringing about changes in the bank rates as an indirect monetary instruments will inform the banks, financial institution and the general public about the nature of' the monetary policy, whether it is expansionary or concretionary.
"
13044,"2. 	Credit Extension to Priority-Sectors
"
13045,"The present provision for a bank to extend a specified proportion of total credit outlay to priority sectors calls for a review in the present context of the liberal economic and monetary policies.
"
13046,"The banks are allowed to use their own discretion whether to extend credit facility to such sectors to the tune of' 12 percent of the total credit in the present system.
"
13047,"However, in spite of adopting the liberal policy, the concept of priority sectors and a directed flow of financial resources to them cannot be totally forsaken in view of the great need of capital among the skilled and enthusiastic entrepreneurs with meager income and, above all, the government's commitment to development of the rural sector.
"
13048,"Therefore, it is targeted to establish separate rural development banks on a regional basis solely for the development of the rural sector.
"
13049,"These banks will function as specialized agencies to channelize the flow of credit to the priority sectors.
"
13050,"A detailed programme in this regard will be put forth for implementation within the initial years of the Eighth Plan.
"
13051,"3. Formulation of Monetary Programme
"
13052,"An efficient utilisation of resources is equally as important as the arrangement of resources for economic management.
"
13053,"Therefore, internal and external stability in using financial resources needs to be specially emphasized.
"
13054,"In the Nepalese context, if there is a monetary or credit expansion beyond a sustainable limit, there will be an increase in the prices of goods and services on the domestic front, which will lead to increased import to meet the growing demand. This will adversely affect the balance of payments situation, deplete foreign exchange reserves and on the whole create imbalances in the external sector as a whole.
"
13055,"To avoid the emergence of such situation in the economy, a monetary programme will be formulated on the basis of an extensive analysis of the economy at the beginning of every fiscal year by reconciling the physical sector and monetary or credit sector with each other for maintaining a balanced situation.
"
13056,"Therefore, the growth rate of mo ney supply and credit structure will be determined in a manner compatible with the changes in different variables such as sustainable economic growth rate, inflation, and external situation etc.
"
13057,"As stated above in the same context, monetary and credit management will be conducted by utilising indirect instruments.
"
13058,"4. Policy of Positive Rates of Interest
"
13059,"In the event of the real rates of interest acquiring a negative trend, there may appear hindrances to the mobilisation of financial resources. Similarly, if the interest rates are not maintained at an appropriate level, the resources may be utilised in less productive sectors and the economy may not obtain reasonable returns from the investment.
"
13060,"Therefore, it is necessary for a policy on interest rates to be able to solve this problem, and efforts will be made to the fullest possible extent to make positive interest rates.
"
13061,"Hence, the monetary and financial policies will be put into use in keeping with the same objective.
"
13062,"5. Government Role and Interference in Credit Management
"
13063,"In one of the poorest nations like Nepal where there live a large section of population below the absolute poverty line it is necessary to enhance their productivity and increase employment opportunities for them. And, in the context of the changed economic policies, it becomes a national duty to make available some returns of development efforts to these people, too.
"
13064,"The credit extension under various programmes to be conducted in the priority sector, in particular, needs to be directed mainly to these people alone.
"
13065,"Our past experiences have demonstrated that a simple and convenient procurement of a loan is of greater significance than its rate of interest.
"
13066,"The banks and financial institutions should mobilise credit extension to these groups in such a manner that they make some profit over and above the realisation of the actual cost.
"
13067,"This section of the population also should not be treated as an exception in the application of the technique of determining an interest rate on the basis of demand and supply situation.
"
13068,"However, the creation of an environment in which there is an assurance of the credit facility is a prerequisite condition.
"
13069,"The confidence of being able to obtain loans can infuse dynamism into the economic activities of these people, too.
"
13070,"At the very initial stage of the implementation of the credit programmes in the Eighth Plan, special attention will be paid to the needs of the targeted groups and the utility of credit.
"
13071,"6. Total Bank Credit Structure
"
13072,"In the past, a considerable share of the limited bank credit outlay was procured by the government. Furthermore, the public enterprises also obtained huge sums of money on government guarantee.
"
13073,"In consequence, the private sector was often deprived of the opportunity of any credit facility.
"
13074,"Now, in the context of HMG pursuing a policy of fiscal discipline, the budget deficit has declined and the monetization of the deficit has been considerably minimized too.
"
13075,"This trend will be continued during the Eighth Plan.
"
13076,"Similarly, as the credit extension to public enterprises on government guarantee adversely affects the soundness of the financial institution and of the commercial banks in their finances, a policy will be adopted to follow the usual market techniques for providing loans to government undertakings.
"
13077,"The banking sector will assist through credit extension in the efficiency and productivity enhancing activities of the private sector in domestic or foreign trade.
"
13078,"7. Expansion of Branch Offices
"
13079,"The expansion of branches entails an unnecessary increased burden of expenditure on the commercial banks and financial institutions causing an adverse impact on their profits. In view of this experience, the branches will be extended on a commercial basis only to economically viable and appropriate places.
"
13080,"Expanding the activities of the branches running in loss,' efforts will be made to operate them in profit.
"
13081,"The branches which fail to show any profit, even after functional adjustments will either be merged with the nearest banking office or dissolved.
"
13082,"However, appropriate programmes may be introduced to provide some banking services even in the areas without banking offices or without any feasibility of any economic activities expanding within a short period.
"
13083,"These programmes may include the introduction of Post-Office Saving Bank, Mobile Savings Bank, Mobile Credit Bank and Cooperative programmes, etc.
"
13084,"8. Strengthening of Banking and Financial Institutions
"
13085,"Necessary steps aimed at appropriate allocation of' Financial resources will be taken in the following subjects on the basis of the position of the economy.
"
13086,"These steps will strengthen the financial position of the banks. a .
"
13087,"Transparent rules on directed loans,
"
13088,"b. 	Sufficiency of the deposits of banks and financial institutions,
"
13089,"c. 	Simplification and transparency of laws and regulations relating to banks and financial institutions,
"
13090,"d. 	A congenial situation for an entry of new financial institutions and the exit of existing ones,
"
13091,"0. Development of the second market,
"
13092,"F. 	Diversification in financial instruments,
"
13093,"g. 	Non interference in the activities of banks and financial institutions from the government. 9. Finance Company
"
13094,"The establishment and development of finance companies will be emphasized for (fie creation and extension of a Competitive financial environment, Appropriate programmes will be formulated for a convenient supply of financial resources from banks to such financial institutions to meet their short term needs.
"
13095,"The development of these institutions in Nepal has not taken place to a desired extent. In this context, the commercial banks should come to the aid of these institutions so that they may be able to mobilise their own medium and long-term resources in the future.
"
13096,"The structure of a finance company determines the extent of its activities.
"
13097,"Smaller companies of this nature will confine themselves to discounting the commercial bills, bills of exchange and cheques whereas the financing of long term projects will require the assistance of large companies.
"
13098,"The Eighth Plan will launch programmes to establish and extend as far as possible such finance companies which may be capable of making arrangements for long term financial resources.
"
13099,"Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions
"
13100,"In the present context of the commercial banks being the only prominent institutions in the Nepalese economy to mobilise the collection of scattered monetary savings among the common people, the establishment of financial institutions may provide further assistance in the monetary collection work.
"
13101,"These financial institutions will, at the same time, be both competitive with and complementary to commercial banks.
"
13102,"In urban sectors with sound financial bases the finance companies will compete with banks, but in areas with relatively scarce financial bases, these companies will play a role complementary to banking activities.
"
13103,"These finance companies classified as non-banking agencies can engage in various activities including providing loans to clients for personal use and are thus provisioned under the Company Act. However, the Nepal Rastra Bank in the capacity of a monetary authority will inspect and supervise their activities in a subtle manner.
"
13104,"Special provisions will be made in the early years of the Eighth Plan with regard to the framework of their sources and utilisation of resources in large urban areas and the rural sector.
"
13105,"11. 	Credit Policy of Commercial Banks
"
13106,"This policy of programme oriented credit extension will be further encouraged. However, it is equally important to make this kind of credit extension risk-free for the commercial banks.
"
13107,"Therefore, an efficient monitoring unit will be formed to supervise whether the extended credit is utilised productively and meaningfully in keeping with the purpose or not. A health report of the project will be prepared and made available.
"
13108,"The credit amount applied for by the projects will be disbursed in installment basis.
"
13109,"12. Collateral Arrangements
"
13110,"The practice of extending loan against collateral cannot be stopped immediately.
"
13111,"Although the share of such loans in total bank credit extension can be lowered comparatively, providing loans on the collateral of gold and silver or food products has their significance in the economy.
"
13112,"The provision of loans on the collateral of a stock of agricultural produce alone can do away with the compulsion of exporting food grains at lower prices.
"
13113,"Therefore, the system of accepting the stock of products as collateral for loans needs to be encouraged. However, such loans will be extended only upon ascertaining the quality and quantity of products in the stock and making proper warehousing arrangements for them.
"
13114,"13. Computerization of Commercial Banks
"
13115,"In the initial stage, computerization will entail additional expenditure and training in computer technology will be equally necessary.
"
13116,"The replacement of traditional accounting system, auditing and supervision by a new technology may create a psychological impact among employees of their relative significance having been decreased.
"
13117,"Therefore, the banks should proceed with computerization on a phased basis by emphasizing on the positive aspects of the computers that they do not make employees redundant but instead enhance the work quality, lighten the employees' operational burden and even create more personnel requirements through the expansion of the banking operation. The Eighth Plan will accordingly orient the banking business towards modern technology.
"
13118,"Strengthening of Institutional Intermediaries The availability of financial resources is a prerequisite for exploiting the possibilities of economic development.
"
13119,"To expand the activities of the existing banks and financial institutions, it is necessary to augment the use of new instruments, to introduce new technology in their operation and to develop a new management system in their organisation.
"
13120,"Moreover, it is also equally important to establish additional institutions in keeping with the demand of the economy.
"
13121,"Therefore, these aspects will be given special emphasis in the Eighth Plan in order to achieve extensive financial soundness of the economy.
"
13122,"Similarly, due attention will be paid to savings and credit management through the development and expansion of financial institutions.
"
13123,"This will extend support to the efforts of controlling the rate of inflation.
"
13124,"The organisational structures of various institutions will be reconciled with the emergent changes in the economic structure.
"
13125,"15. Establishment of a Rural Bank
"
13126,"During the Eighth Plan period, rural banks will be established with a view to attaining sustainable economic development through an intensive increase in rural economic activities. The activities of these banks will definitely support the programmes aimed at raising the standard of living of the people living in abject poverty below the absolute poverty line and reduce the regional disparities.
"
13127,"These banks will operate in the rural sector and extend credit facilities to small and cottage industries, income generating and productive agricultural activities and small scale business and trade.
"
13128,"Upon the establishment of these banks, various rural sector programmes such as priority sector credit and small farmer's credit and those of the commercial banks, too, will be conducted through them. Capital Market
"
13129,"Background
"
13130,"In order to assist in the economic development of the country, it is very essential to develop a healthy capital market.
"
13131,"The capital market provides an important base for the development of industry, commerce and the economy.
"
13132,"The recent adoptions of liberal economic policies and privatisation programmes by His Majesty's Government with the objective of involving extensive private sector participation in the Eighth Plan is expected to provide ample investment opportunities in the country and will help maximise the demand for capital.
"
13133,"In this context, it will be necessary to develop and expand a healthy capital market. Hence, to set up the necessary infra -structure to achieve the aims of the Eighth Plan and to attain speedy economic development, capital market should be considered seriously and given priority.
"
13134,"At present the expansion of capital market in Nepal is severely limited.
"
13135,"On the one hand, there is a very limited growth of primary and secondary markets for shares, on the other, special institutions such as merchant banking which help in the execution of the capital market are still in their infancy.
"
13136,"In the same manner, well established financial institutions like the provident fund and insurance corporations in the dearth of legal provisions have not been able to participate in the activities of the capital market arena.
"
13137,"Investors also do not seem inclined to establish and manage their businesses in the form of public companies.
"
13138,"These factors limit the capital market activities to the transaction of limited shares and government treasury bills and securities.
"
13139,"Because of these reasons a proper infrastructure development for industrial occupations in the country has not taken place. To reform the existing situation in order to develop the capital market and to establish it as an institution it has become necessary to activate the role of financial institutions in the capital market.
"
13140,"Even though the national plans of the past did not contain comprehensive plans with regard to the security market, the working policies and programmes of the Security Exchange Centre were fixed for the Seventh Plan period (1985-90).
"
13141,"The Centre's strategies and programmes relating to the mobilization of Internal resources necessary in the process of industrialization, together with the institutional development of the private sector were formulated and implemented.
"
13142,"The Seventh Plan aimed to mobilize capital through security market, involve public participation in the ownership of industrial and commercial enterprises, facilitate capital transactions by establishing a security exchange market and promoting professional brokers in the private sector.
"
13143,"As per the stipulated programme for the Seventh Plan period, seventeen companies were targeted to be enlisted in the Centre and made eligible for security transactions.
"
13144,"At the end of the plan, paid-up shares worth Rs 750 million were enlisted and their market value reached 1,620 million approximately.
"
13145,"But the annual transaction of shares could not exceed RS. 30 million and remained minimum in relation to market value.
"
13146,"Bonds issued by His Majesty's Government were expected to record transactions worth Rs 1,600 million but government bond transaction exceeded Rs 3,000 million.
"
13147,"In the process of collecting the necessary capital for the establishment and expansion of the industrial enterprises, and in giving the ordinary people the opportunity to participate, the Centre was involved in advising on the issuance of capital, its management, sales and warranty assurances.
"
13148,"Eighteen companies were enlisted during the plan period.
"
13149,"During this period, share capital worth over Rs 210 million was attracted towards organized investment through the market.
"
13150,"It is estimated that by the end of the plan period the number of people investing in shares reached 37,000.
"
13151,"Legal infrastructures were prepared to appoint brokers, conduct transactions, carry out monitoring and control of the development of the security market.
"
13152,"In this plan period, the broker's code of conduct and rules of transactions were formulated and presented to His Majesty's Government for approval.
"
13153,"During the Seventh Plan period the Centre made special efforts to inform investors, and the general public about the various aspects of the security market, the state of enlisted companies and the market and transaction values etc.
"
13154,"Progress during Fiscal Year 1990/91 and 1991/92
"
13155,"In the first year of the planning holiday period five additional organized institutions were enlisted and during the first six months of the second year four more companies were enlisted. This raised the total number of companies eligible for transactions in the market to 50.
"
13156,"Like in the past, the government treasury bills were predominant among the transactable securities in the market.
"
13157,"In the fiscal year 1990/91, government treasury bills worth Rs 910 million were transacted. In first half of fiscal year 1991/92 transactions worth Rs 142.5 million were made.
"
13158,"In the primary issue market three institutions were provided consultancy services and one institution was assisted in issuing shares worth Rs8.9 million in the fiscal year 1990/91. During the first half of fiscal year 1991/92 three companies were provided consultancy services and the share s of one company were floated to acquire capital.
"
13159,"Though the draft regulations pertaining to the appointment of professional brokers and rules of transactions in the security market were being refined by the concerned authorities, they could not be enforced due to the failure to obtain approval.
"
13160,"Existing Problems in the Capital Market
"
13161,"In the existing financial set-up, in addition to the Security Exchange Centre various Development Banks, Employees' Provident Fund, National Insurance Corporation function asinseparable units in the capital market.
"
13162,"But the vacuum in the present financial structure needs to be filled by institutionally developing capital market institutions like investment companies, finance companies, leasing and housing finance in order to create a healthy, competitive financial structure.
"
13163,"Despite past efforts, the capital market is still in its infancy due to the lack of coordination between planning, policy formulation and its implementation.
"
13164,"The economy has not been able to derive synergistic benefits due to the division in the activities of units related to the capital market.
"
13165,"Although the number and resources of commercial banks, development banks and other financial units have increased and developed, the acquired resources are not directed towards the capital market.
"
13166,"The present financial institutions have been unable to carry out capital market activities such as merchant banking, the award of risk capital and professional brokerage in the security market, on a priority basis.
"
13167,"Hire-purchase and other activities are fully lacking.
"
13168,"Because of the inability of the established financial sector to the consumer needs, the 'Upahaarl programmes, the 'Dhukuti' programmes are being run unofficially.
"
13169,"In this way, by the emergence of this sector, the resource mobilization and investment of the established sector have been directly affected resulting in a set-back in the financial structure.
"
13170,"The industrialization of the country can be made possible only by timely checking the distortions arising out of the situation by the consolidation of the financial aspects together with the well planned development of the capital market.
"
13171,"It is essential to pay attention to the consolidation and development of the capital market in order to fulfil the objectives of the Eighth Plan.
"
13172,"Firstly, to realise the aims of the plan; the private sector must fulfil their responsibilities, necessary capital must be supplied to expedite industrial development and it is imperative that the capital market take up an active role supporting economic liberalization.
"
13173,"The capital market is also a must for the privatization of public enterprises as well as for the development of the industrial occupation.
"
13174,"Keeping in mind the present state of the capital market and the additional responsibilities entrusted by the plan, capital market planning needs to be formulated in such a manner that it solves the existing problems and challenges given below.
"
13175,"1. The organised financial sector in the country is oriented towards commercial banking.
"
13176,"Its five commercial banks occupy more than three fourths of the financial sector's total resources.
"
13177,"The capital market being comparatively new and small, the balanced development of the financial sector has not occurred.
"
13178,"2. The present structure of the capital market is also mainly lending oriented.
"
13179,"The security market is dominated by bonds and securities issued by His Majesty's Government. Though the practice of floating shares by the organized sector is growing; the dearth of feasible projects and the lack of incentives to enter the capital market have prevented the security market from taking on a more active role.
"
13180,"The only industrial bank has not been able to expand its operations due to limitations of resources. organizations, capable of mobilising resources such as the Employees' Provident Fund and Insurance companies limit their resources to government securities, bank deposits and loan extension and hence have not been able to influence institutional securities.
"
13181,"The organized sector has not been able to become marketoriented and competitive because of the practice of meeting the financial requirements of the government institutions (which account for a major portion of the organized sector) from the budget.
"
13182,"3. The economy is significantly lacking in a number of institutions and activities which should be playing an active role in the capital market.
"
13183,"Because of the insufficiency of institutions such as finance companies, leasing, housing finance, pension fund, hire purchase, merchant banking and investment banking; underwriting, lease, risk capital, dealer, market maker, brokering service and the like are also lacking.
"
13184,"4. The collection of capital by the issue of shares is not yet an established method of fund raising, nor has it been possible to bring out the differentiations in the nature of shares.
"
13185,"The practice of speculating with investors' risk-bearing capacity and the expected returns; and issuing government bonds and shares on the basis of the speculations has not yet developed.
"
13186,"Similarly, the practice of fulfilling the demand for capital by issuing accumulative, non-accumulative or convertible preference shares, debentures, floating rate bonds, etc. has not been developed.
"
13187,"Government and non -government units do not issue shares in market.
"
13188,"The tradition of companies accepting public deposits has not developed.
"
13189,"In the same way, there is a lack of a unit with requisite policy programme to fix and coordinate the return rates of the capital market.
"
13190,"5. Keeping the well-being of investors in mind, it has become necessary to ensure the effective functioning of services rendered by the Security Exchange Centre; services like the new issues and their sales management, the establishment of secondary market and brokering services.
"
13191,"There is the lack of a full- fledged powerful unit to conduct the capital market services on the basis of priority; there is concomitantly the lack of a mechanism which keeps a close watch in order to ensure a healthy controlled development, which declares disclosure standards, which gives policy directives and monitors to ensure a healthy market, and which safeguards the interests of investors and recommends necessary measures and gives right directions for their implementation.
"
13192,"6. Because the Security Exchange Centre is in itself the controller, the market builder and the coordinator of the secondary market; a controlled and coordinated development has not been developed, and this has adversely affected the growth of the capital market.
"
13193,"Because the environment in the secondary market is not conducive to the active participation of brokers, the scope of such markets is severely limited. This situation has not inspired the growth of even the primary market.
"
13194,"Thus, the capital market, specially the stock market has remained small.
"
13195,"7. At present, there seems to be no unity and coordination among the units related to the capital market. Because the informal exchange of capital takes place in a bigger scale, capital is unavailable for larger projects.
"
13196,"Similarly, because the capital market is not open to foreign investors and the circulation of capital and there is a lack of modernization in capital market activities, it has not been possible to direct the capital to come up.
"
13197,"In view of the above-mentioned problems and challenges, the following objectives and programmes have been formulated for the capital market in the Eighth Plan.
"
13198,"Objectives
"
13199,"1. An appropriate capital market will be developed in order to facilitate the accelerated growth of industry, trade, agriculture and other occupations.
"
13200,"2. To develop an effective and efficient institutional structure so that the capital market plays an enhanced and significant role in order to achieve a balanced development in the financial sector.
"
13201,"3. Creating an environment for the maximization of public investment, a significant portion of the private sector investment and the investment amount required by HMG in the form of internal loans within the plan period are to be raised through the issue of shares in the capital market.
"
13202,"4. To encourage the mobilization of financial resources through the official sector by developing a healthy capital market.
"
13203,"Policies
"
13204,"To attain the above mentioned objectives of the Eight Plan, the following policies will be adopted.
"
13205,"1. To issue securities such as shares, bonds and debentures fo r the mobilisation of funds, to protect and safeguard the rights and well-being of investors in shares, to issue license to centres involved in shares transactions; to follow up and supervise; to bring to public notice statistics related to organised econo mic and financial institutions; to state the responsibilities of these companies, organisations, the attached legal experts, accountants, etc, and all other activities concerned with capital are to be managed in an efficient manner by setting up a Securities Exchange Board in order to control the stock market.
"
13206,"2. The Security Exchange Centre undertaking the competitive transaction of the shares is to bedeveloped as a non -profit self regulatory organization leading to the establishment of a stock exchange.
"
13207,"And in long term, the ownership and the functioning of the stock exchange will be transferred to the brokers of the private sector. An appropriate unit will be formed to generate the necessary additional capital for the expansion of market 	facilities.
"
13208,"3. In order to encourage the participation of Employees' Provident Fund, Insurance Companies, banks and financial institutions in the capital market, the required amendments to their acts and regulations will be made.
"
13209,"Similarly, the dependence of private and public sector institutions, local units and development banks for medium and long term capital on His Majesty's government will be reduced by issuing different types of shares to collect capital.
"
13210,"Thus the development banks will be encouraged to raise capital from the general public.
"
13211,"4. To develop and extend the intermediary system of capital market, the involvement of financial institution will be encouraged in such activities as management of share issuance, guarantees, brokerage and the creation of market as well as in assisting the promotion of established institutions in such activities in the private sector so as to further consolidate primary and secondary markets.
"
13212,"5. Provision will be made to conduct regular training and seminars on various aspects of the security market such as project, company, and share evaluations, transaction of securities and management of the information system for financial entrepreneurs involved in various activities of the capital market.
"
13213,"These institutions will function as the authority of issuing shares and also as a guarantor and share investor to assist in developing the primary market. Besides, they will increase market liquidity by getting involved as a broker, market maker and portfolio manager in the secondary market.
"
13214,"7. Necessary ame ndments will be made in the existing act and rules pertaining to the capital market in accordance with the liberal policies mentioned in the objectives so as to develop the security market.
"
13215,"In carrying out these amendments, necessary legal basis will be prepared to regulate unofficial financial programmes and to enable companies to easily issue debentures, acquire deposits and issue negotiable certificates of deposits.
"
13216,"8. Necessary legal amendments will be made and programmes prepared and implemented so as to gradually pave the way for foreign investors to enter the security market.
"
13217,"Similarly, efforts will be made to enhance public interest and faith in companies or institutions by developing a system of credit rating.
"
13218,"This will assist companies to mobilize resources on the basis of public trust.
"
13219,"The investments to be made in shares and information about the capital market will be widely disseminated and educational programmes will be conducted to promote interest in this field among the general public.
"
13220,"9. Increased capital shares of the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation will be issued in order to make investment possible in large projects.
"
13221,"For this the collection of capital from the market will be encouraged.
"
13222,"The organizational and legal structures of the existing banks and financial institutions will be reviewed and the capital in the financial sector will be made to flow effectively towards productive projects through the medium of securities. 11.
"
13223,"In the course of industrial development, the legal and administrative provisions relating to activities such as the liquidation of professional institutions, their dissolution, buy outs, mergers, fair trade practice, bankruptcy, property rights and transfer of rights will be improved and developed.
"
13224,"Programmes
"
13225,"1. Necessary legal draft and organizational model will be prepared to establish the Security Exchange Board by developing legal and organizational basis to conduct and control the security market.
"
13226,"Legal and organizational arrangement will be made to ensure that enlisted companies publish and specify the status of disclosures to the general public and to follow up on the same while issuing shares.
"
13227,"2. The present Security Exchange Centre will be established as a non-profit self regulatory stock exchange institution.
"
13228,"The participation of the private sector will be gradually increased so as to develop the physical facilities necessary for stock exchange transactions.
"
13229,"3. The Employees' Provident Fund, insurance companies and other financial institutions will be encouraged to invest in shares, debentures and security bonds in order to attract the organized financial sector resources towards the security market.
"
13230,"4. To develop and expand the intermediary institutions and services of the capital market, the Citizens Investment Fund and other financial institutions will arrange primary issue guarantees and be involved in building up the brokerage market and other activities.
"
13231,"5. Provisions will be made to train manpower in order to develop the security market.
"
13232,"6. Arrangements will be made in order to encourage smaller investors to invest their savings in securities.
"
13233,"For this various saving programmes will be conducted by the Citizens' Investment Fund or institutions authorized to conduct such schemes so that these savings can be mobilized and invested in the organized sector and financial services will also be provided and profits distributed among the participants.
"
13234,"After the relevant Trust Act is developed the institution that controls the security market will permit various trust companies to function.
"
13235,"7. The security market will be utilized for raising medium and long term capital. The policy of providing grants, loans and share capital to the institutions of His Majesty's Government will be reviewed and the practice of issuing shares at competitive values will be encouraged.
"
13236,"The tradition of issuing shares in order to acquire necessary means of investment will be further developed in organizations like the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and the Agriculture Development Bank.
"
13237,"The possibilities of adopting the issuance of shares by 1 ocal urban units in their construction and development works will also be examined.
"
13238,"8. To regularize the financial activities in the informal sector and to channelize them towards the formal sector, the necessary legal basis and :institutional set-up will be provided.
"
13239,"The necessary unit will be set up to make legal and administrative provisions related to activities like the liquidation of business enterprises, buy outs, mergers, fair trade practices, bankruptcies, property rights and the transfer of these rights.
"
13240,"9. The practice of raising public funds by companies will be promoted and effective legal and institutional provisions will be made to carry out proper mo nitoring of this activity. 10.
"
13241,"The establishment and functioning of companies which involve extensive public participation will be encouraged.
"
13242,"The existing system of registering companies separately in the industry and commerce departments will be reformed and a single registration unit established.
"
13243,"In the process of these reforms, activities like the conversion of private companies into public ones, the merger of companies and the entry and exit of companies will be made clear, simple and effective.
"
13244,"In companies that aim to establish themselves by mobilizing extensive public participation, the financial institutions can, by functioning as founders, adopt the policy of providing share capital and guarantee facilities.
"
13245,"To impart dynamism to share transactions in the organized sector, the stock exchange will be operated exploring the feasibility of a Share Depository and Registration Unit.
"
13246,"Public Enterprises and Privatisation
"
13247,"Background
"
13248,"Public enterprises were established as a strong means of development after the Second World War in developing countries. such enterprises were established in developed countries from the Eighteenth century.
"
13249,"However, in the developing countries, constrained with the scarcity of capital and professional skills, the significance of such enterprises was evidently even greater; so in these countries, right from the infrastructural and service areas to the production and even distribution sectors, public enterprises were established.
"
13250,"It was believed that the government should play a predominant role in national economic development especially in those developed and developing countries cast in the socialistic pattern. with this view, public enterprises were established in production, distribution and even in business sectors.
"
13251,"In Nepal too, the same ideas were behind the emergence of such enterprises.
"
13252,"Public enterprises were established in order to prepare infrastructure services, to produce the required goods in the country and to export, to help in controlling the price situation, to create opportunities for employment, to increase government revenues and to contribute significantly in the national development as well as to assist in the country's economic advancement.
"
13253,"In Nepal, the public enterprises were established in public services, industry, trade, finance and other sectors to create the infrastructure for basic services; and also because the private sector was seen as inefficient in important areas; the capital investment capability was low, and because technical know-how development was still in a very primary stage.
"
13254,"After Nepal Bank Limited was established in 1954 as a public enterprise, other such enterprises like Nepal Industrial Development Corporation and Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation also came into being.
"
13255,"In the industrial sector also, industries like the Janakpur Cigarette Factory, Birgunj sugar Mill, and Bansbari Leather Shoe Factory were established in 1961.
"
13256,"Subsequently, banks, business sector, telecommunication, electricity and water supply in the services sector; cement, bricks, medicines and textiles in the industrial sectors came into existence.
"
13257,"In this way, at present sixty two different public enterprises are established in Nepal.
"
13258,"Although the development of public enterprises has achieved the above mentioned aims by creating employment opportunities, increasing production in the country and providing the important basic services; the enterprises have not been functioning in an efficient manner.
"
13259,"Despite the long term protection given to these public enterprises they have not been able to achieve financial capability and work efficiency and are still dependent upon government grants. So in order to enhance their efficiency, it has become necessary to think seriously about them.
"
13260,"Upto the fiscal year 1990/91 His Majesty's Government had invested a capital of Rs 6,303.2 million and loan investment worth Rs 15,584.2 million on the existing public enterprises.
"
13261,"The enterprises which were audited in the fiscal year 1989/90 showed a loss of Rs 240 million, which increased upto Rs 1,870 million in the fiscal year 1990/91.
"
13262,"From this, it has been evident that public enterprises have become a perpetual financial burden.
"
13263,"As the average capacity utilization of these enterprises was only 52 percent and had mostly gone into loss, the capital grants to be given by HMG for functional and transportation expenses gradually increased to Rs 76,720 million in the fiscal year 1990/91.
"
13264,"Since it has become necessary to enhance the working efficiency, to effect managerial reforms and to run these enterprises from the commercial point of view, it is necessary to analyze the nature of these enterprises and to privatize them. Where privatization is not possible, efficiency enhancement programmes must be introduced immediately.
"
13265,"Past Efforts
"
13266,"Keeping in mind the condition of public enterprises, His Majesty's Government has initiated privatization efforts from this decade onwards.
"
13267,"Privatization efforts had started even before this.
"
13268,"For example, frequent efforts were made to sell the Balaju Textile Industry.
"
13269,"However, besides the then lack of political commitment necessary for privatization, the faculty preparatory programme caused the privatization efforts end in a fiasco.
"
13270,"Similarly, in the year 1985, His Majesty's Government had made the decision to privatize one company every one month but implementation in this direction was not made.
"
13271,"In the year 1988, HMG had taken the decision to sell 49 percent shares of the Birgunj Sugar Mill. in the same period, efforts to privatize the Himal cement Company also failed.
"
13272,", The of forts made by the National Industrial Development Corporation to hand over the shares under its ownership to the private sector could not succeed due to the lack of farsightedness.
"
13273,"In 1989, His Majesty's Government decided to privatize 50 percent shares of 30 public enterprises and a privatization committee was also formed.
"
13274,"The said committees prepared a draft white paper and programme relating to privatization and submitted them to His Majesty's Government after which no action was taken in the direction of privatization.
"
13275,"Thus, due to incomplete and faulty preparations and the lack of necessary determination, the many efforts at privatization made in the past were unsuccessful.
"
13276,"For the formulation of necessary policies relating to privatisation, a privatisation committee was set up under the Ministry of Finance, the Corporation Coordination Division with a special unit for privatization was formed and policies relating to privatization were also brought to public notice.
"
13277,"Together with this, the decision to privatise the Harisiddhi Bricks and Tile Factory, the Bansbari Leather Shoe Factory and Bhrikuti Paper Mills was also made public.
"
13278,"The above mentioned enterprises were put on sale by calling on open tenders, large scale negotiations were carried on with institutions interested in purchasing and the final eligible purchasers were awarded the deals.
"
13279,"Thus, on the basis of the experience gained through the privatisation of these three corporations and keeping with the plan of pursuing the privatisation programme systematically, HMG has started to select other new corporations for privatisation. The Necessity of Privatization
"
13280,"Although the establishment of public enterprises had greatly assisted in the country's industrial and professional development, and helped to prepare the necessary institutional base, the enterprises themselves could not succeed.
"
13281,"To accelerate the pace of national development it has become necessary to increase efficiency in all areas through proper and efficient management.
"
13282,"Together with this it has become necessary to bring about changes in the structural framework of the corporations in order to enhance the standard of services rendered by them.
"
13283,"Mainly, the following reasons make the privatisation of public enterprises a necessity; 1.
"
13284,"By now HMG has made a credit extension of over Rs 15 billion and capital investments worth Rs6 billion on various public enterprises, yet the returns from these enterprises are negligible. Even to keep them functioning, the government has had to provide additional annual grants.
"
13285,"Thus, most of these enterprises are running in losses. 2. Because the corporations are tied up by various rules and regulations they lack necessary flexibility and, hence, the competitiveness.
"
13286,"3. Because most of the corporations are overstaffed, the expenditures are unduly high and their productivity and competitive capabilities are adversely affected. Therefore, they are not being able to provide expected services.
"
13287,"4. There is a lack of skilled professionals and responsible management in the corporations.
"
13288,"5. It has become necessary to direct the government resources more towards social welfare and other areas than to these enterprises and commercial sectors.
"
13289,"Because or these reasons HMG has adopted the aim of privatising public enterprises. The objectives of privatisation are mainly concerned with the development of industry and business sectors, increment in productivity and efficiency, the mobilisation. of savings and increase in public participation in the commercial field.
"
13290,"Objectives 1 	By enhancing the efficiency and competitive ability of corporations, production and productivity will be increased along with the promotion of co-operatives.
"
13291,"2. Programmes to increase efficiency in both types of corporations which are not to be privatised and which are to be privatised in future are to be initiated and reorganization works for better management are to be conducted.
"
13292,"Policies
"
13293,"1. A long-term strategy on privatisation will be devised. Corporations of industrial and business nature will be gradually privatised.
"
13294,"All policies and. programmes relating to privatization will be made transparent.
"
13295,"2. The private sector will be allowed to operate projects related to public utility sector like hydroelectricity, drinking water and other public utility services but for the present, public enterprises set up in those areas will continue to operate in the government sector.
"
13296,"And, those public enterprises which are considered as important from the public view point will also be operated under the government sector.
"
13297,"3. In the process of privatisation of corporations or in implementing efficiency enhancing programmes the current employees will also be included as far as possible, but if the number of employees/ labourers are more than necessary, they will be removed only after providing adequate compensation.
"
13298,"4. To privatise and to increase the efficiency in corporations, a central unit will be formed. This unit will conduct ail the works relating to privatisation with the support of concerned ministries.
"
13299,"5. The privatisation of public enterprises will be undertaken in groups such as those being privatised immediately, those to be privatised after a certain period of time, or those to be privatised after restructuring in the long-term. Necessary improvement programmes will be launched for corporations to be privatised later and not to be privatised at all.
"
13300,"Corporations will be shut down, should it be difficult to introduce improvement programmes, where privatisation cannot take place and where it is irrelevant to continue operating as a public enterprise.
"
13301,"6. In the process of privatisation, the evaluation will be made together with other necessary preparatory arrangements.
"
13302,"Efforts will be made to increase public participation in the ownership as far as possible.
"
13303,"In future it will be clearly stated whether a reduction in employees/labourers is possible or not, and in the case of having to reduce them, how much compensation they will be given.
"
13304,"7. Legal basis will be prepared for the privatisation of corporations, considering their structure.
"
13305,"Those corporations, established through special legal provisions will be handed over through the company laws and privatised.
"
13306,"Large public enterprises can also be privatised on the basis of deferred payment.
"
13307,"In such cases, the form of instalments and the initial instalment should also be clearly specified initially. 12.
"
13308,"To successfully implement privatisation programmes, a privatisation commission as well as a committee of experts on privatisation will be formed and under. them privatisation works will be completed.
"
13309,"In relation to Improvement of Efficiency in Public Enterprises which will not be Privatised or those which will be Privatised in the Future:
"
13310,"1. As the important service sectors such as electricity, water and communications can provide more services  in the form of public enterprises functioning under HMG, for the time being, efficiency enhancement programmes will be conducted in these types of corporations. Public participation in corporation sectors will be increased by privatizing many corporations of a commercial nature.
"
13311,"2. Public enterprises to be run by HMG will conduct programmes to increase efficiency in productivity, to make maximum use of available capabilities, to bring about reforms in management, to reduce expenditure and investment in unproductive and less beneficial sectors, and to organise the personnel systems.
"
13312,"While conducting such programmes the professional management will also be involved.
"
13313,"Reformistic action will be taken after a diagnostic studies of the present state of these enterprises. 31 	To increase the efficiency of the corporations, expenditures will be deducted and to increase productivity by adoption of the cost-benefit approach, etc. will be implemented. By this, the corporations will be made self sufficient and the grants to these corporations will be reduced gradually.
"
13314,"4. In order to increase productivity, programmes will be conducted to fully mobilize capacity utilization, to gradually use the appropriate technology, to bring about reforms in training and management, and to establish an appropriate pattern of working style.
"
13315,"Management committees will be formed comprising mainly efficient and skilled persons representing the private sector or professional groups.
"
13316,"A conducive environment will also be created to run the corporations in a well organised manner by appointing the chairman and the general manager on professional merit basis.
"
13317,"5. To create a competitive environment in areas where public enterprises enjoying monopoly, private sector will be given to operate similar units gradually.
"
13318,"6. Unnecessary and unproductive expenditures and investments will be cut down and expenditure control measures will be put into practice.
"
13319,"The management will be provided with greater autonomy to run public enterprises.
"
13320,"Government intervention in fixing prices will cease gradually.
"
13321,"7. An appropriace system of reward and punishment on the basis of efficiency enhancement works and their results will be introduced in the corporations.
"
13322,"To make such a system function, its proper implementation will be encouraged.
"
13323,"The management will be made responsible to ensure that work is carried out properly.
"
13324,"8. If necessary, public enterprises will be reorganized in the following manner:
"
13325,"a. By floating the necessary capital.
"
13326,"b. By reevaluating assets and loans. c By writing off the accumulated losses and creating new capital structure.
"
13327,"d. By capitalizing the loans of the HMG
"
13328,"e. By selling or leasing out unnecessary and useless property.
"
13329,"By merging two or more corporations to function in a more successful manner, if deemed proper.
"
13330,"h. By providing management contracts or memorandum of understanding to increase the efficiency of the selected corporations.
"
13331,"i. By removing unnecessary manpower providing them with appropriate compensation upon  conducting necessary studies while reorganizing the corporations.
"
13332,"j. By making efforts to improve the efficiency of corporations with the involvement of efficient and capable managers, besides the general manager, in other top management posts as required.
"
13333,"k. By making this kind of appointment also through the lateral entry system.
"
13334,"1. Reorganising the Working committees by appointing professional and efficient directors in smaller corporations working committees.
"
13335,"Institutional Arrangements
"
13336,"The implementation and monitoring works relating to the strengthening of corporations, competence enhancement, new investment and the policy of privatization will be carried out by the Corporations Coordination Division of the Ministry of Finance, HMG, concerned ministries and corporations as per the guidelines of the Privatization Commission or the Experts committee on privatization.
"
13337,"Development Administration
"
13338,"Background An efficient administrative machinery is necessary for the timely completion of the nation's development and construction works in order to respond to the growing desire for development and to avail the fruits of deve lopment to every household of the people.
"
13339,"For this, the administrative and technological capabilities in the upper level should be enhanced. It is well known that it will be difficult to implement the development and construction works effectively as desired in the absence of coordination between the needs of the administrative machinery and development and construction works.
"
13340,"In this context, it has become very essential to reform the administrative machinery in accordance with the time.
"
13341,"Although the slogan of calling for the effectiveness and reforms in administration was given from the very beginning of the development plan, the complaint that desired and impressive progress in this direction was not achieved holds ground in its own place.
"
13342,"It is clear that the implementation of the country's development plan according to its target has not been possible because, from the economic point of view, the administrative machinery is burdensome and unproductive; in its organizational aspects, difficult to manage and control; and from the service view-point, more government - oriented rather than people -oriented. Further, the absence of transparancy and permanence with regard to the proper use of civil servants in the country's development works through training, proper placement, transfers, promotions, job security, and career development opportunities has resulted in the loss of public confidence in and the emergence of an inefficient administration.
"
13343,"The policy of implementing the recommendations of the administration reform commission will be gradually adopted with timely reforms in order to effect immediate reforms in a sick administration and to make it service oriented. The image of public administration is to be made neutral, fearless, impartial and it is to be rendered small and active.
"
13344,"Giving priority to make the development administration strong and achievement oriented in the Eighth Plan period, the existing government administration units will be reformed in their organizational set-up functions, duties and system of functioning, administrative procedures and acts and rules pertaining to them. In order to ensure a high morale among civil servants, career development opportunity and economic and other facilities will also be improved by developing a transparent system of assessing work efficiency and responsibility level and by institutionalizing a system of reward and punishment on the basis of the same in order to review all aspects of administration so that an efficient, strong and effective administrative machinery may be prepared.
"
13345,"It is necessary to reform the procedure of formulating plans and* programmes in order to bring dynamism in development administration.
"
13346,"In this process, legal rights will be devolved to villages, municipalities and district development committees to undertake responsibilities such as the formulation, implementation and evaluation of local level plans which aim to mobilise and involve local means and resources and to enhance local participation for local development works.
"
13347,"Based on local requirements, periodic and. annual plans of villages, towns and districts will be, made by the local units themselves, by involving the maximum participation of people in the development process. For this, the centre will provide the necessary technology and technical assistance as well as help to strengthen the management.
"
13348,"This will help to bring an end to the practice of demanding and approving adhoc programmes and budgets.
"
13349,"The formulation and implementation of central level plans will be exclusively based on a programme oriented budget system for which the feasibility study, environmental impact assessment, benefit/cost ratio, work schedule, manpower management, provision of review and coordination between the centre and local units or its absence will provide the basis.
"
13350,"The monitoring and evaluation of central level plans will be done within a specified time on a regular basis by consolidating and increasing the efficiency of the central organization's planning and monitoring unit.
"
13351,"The decision making process will be revamped by clearly defining the rights and responsibilities of all levels required for conducting administration at various levels and for formulating and implementing development and construction works. Provision will also be made to ensure the rights of all levels.
"
13352,"The practice of irrational transfers of civil servants involved in the implementation of development planning will be brought to an end.
"
13353,"Keeping in view the effect on the projects due to delays in hand-over, take -over and audit clearance works, the work performance of the concerned civil servants will be linked to the evaluation process in order to ensure the timely execution of such works.
"
13354,"The current development administration is uneconomical; there prevails a privilege seeking tendency and flimsy financial discipline. In this context, on the one hand, efforts will be made to embrace austerity measures by enhancing the morale of civil servants, and on the other, transparent rules and regulations with reference to reward and punishment will be made to ensure strict enforcement of financial discipline.
"
13355,"Legal measures to curb corruption will be reinforced. As development activities are more effectively conducted by non-government and the private sectors than through government efforts, the Eighth Plan will aim at creating an atmosphere conducive to the maximum participation of non governmental organizations in development activities by increasing their skills, knowledge and management capacities.
"
13356,"The. work force of civil servants is increasing with the creation of new posts in various government organizations.
"
13357,"Nonetheless, due to the lack of accountability, they are being evidently underutilized. This has been attributed to the absence of job description, the absence of working standard and levels of responsibility among various ranks.
"
13358,"Job description of each and every rank or grade will be prepared and implemented and if necessary, the policy of cutting down the number of underutilised posts will also be followed.
"
13359,"Another important aspect of public administration is the simplification of the decision making process.
"
13360,"For this, the delegation of authority and the decentralisation of power is essential. Therefore special emphasis will be given-by the central level to handover the responsibility and to delegate authority at the implementing stage.
"
13361,"The important aspects of development administration are to complete the construction and development works in a coordinated manner, to develop the necessary capabilities and to increase the productivity of the civil servants.
"
13362,"In order to achieve these qualities, physical, psychological, economic, social and legal provisions have to be strengthened. Therefore, in the Eighth Plan period matters pertaining to the creation of posts, transfers, training, work performance, evaluation, promotions, salaries and allowances and other facilities as well as matters concerned with level, rank and service have been clearly stated in order to build prestigious ima ge of the public administration.
"
13363,"According to the recommendations of the pay commission, periodic revisions will be made in salaries and allowances, and legal discrepancies in relation to civil service will be removed through democratic and liberal act and rules.
"
13364,"In order to remove the delay and slackness, decisions motivated by vested interest, irregularities and corruptions from the administrative sector, clear legal provisions will be made and strictly enforced.
"
13365,"All units involved in curbing corruption will be strengthened.
"
13366,"Considering the compulsion to remain in a single post for years in the civil service due to the absence of career development opportunities, steps will be taken to provide these opportunities so that the competence and morale does not get reduced.
"
13367,"Lower level civil servants managing their livelihood within their limited incomes will be provided service opportunities near their home districts.
"
13368,"Special training will be provided to civil servants attached to local units in order to make them more service oriented, honest and dutiful.
"
13369,"In order to make development administration efficient, the decision making process relating to financial matters such as contract deals, procurement and supply, giving priorities to national products, the process of acquisition of land and technical dealings will be simplified by entrusting the responsibility to the concerned responsible officials.
"
13370,"Bookkeeping and accounting systems will be gradually improved.
"
13371,"The practice of allocating the budget at the centre for the works to be done in the Villages and districts will be abolished and the system of allocating budgets according to the principles of decentralization will be strengthened.
"
13372,"Keeping in view the problems of accumulating irregularities arising out of the failure to carry out timely audits, a system will be developed wherein civil servants accountable for expenditures, will be made responsible to ensure that timely audit are conducted.
"
13373,"The practicalities of implementing foreign aided projects will be considered prior to agreement, and efforts will be made to discourage obstruction in matters relating to the release of funds and expenditures after the agreement has been reached.
"
13374,"The constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990, has stipulated on matters relating to departmental punishments that the proposed punishment against any non-gazetted civil servants also needs prior approval of the Public Service Commission.
"
13375,"The administration can be made competent only by selecting appropriate people by bringing about timely reforms in the process of assessing the suitability, the bases for promotions and the examination system and procedures concerning civil servants.
"
13376,"The Public Service Commission will be provided necessary assistance in order to strengthen these aspects.
"
13377,"A policy will be adopted to strengthen the managemen t of the Public Service Commission by improving its physical condition.
"
13378,"The practice of the recruitment of employees on bases other than the principles stated by the public service commission will be made punishable.
"
13379,"The most powerful means of rendering the administration efficient are the enhancement of knowledge and skill which can, only be attained through training.
"
13380,"The development of curriculum, training material, training techniques, mechanical techniques, efficient instructors and coordination among the training casetres, are the pre-requisites of qualitative training.
"
13381,"The training programmes will be made effective by establishing upon conducting a relevant study on umbrella organis ation, if necessary, to maintain the quality of and balance as well as coordination among training programmes.
"
13382,"These training casetres will be encouraged to help increase the management capabilities of non government organizations.
"
13383,"In the Eighth Plan the structure of the central organizations will be made more dynamic and a policy will be embraced wherein central units will be given active responsibilities in policy making, in reducing the levels of decision making in formulating perspective plans and in supervision and monitoring activities.
"
13384,"The system of carrying out timely supervision and regular monitoring of programmes conducfed by individual organizations will be developed, the final responsibility for which will lie with the secretaries of miniseries. The concerned secretary will also bear the responsibilities; of co-ordinating the central level programmes to avoid repetition and maintaining inter-ministerial coordination.
"
13385,"A system will also be established wherein regular supervisions and follow-ups will be used to identify adverse effects faced by the project due to incorrect technical studies and action will be taken against those responsible.
"
13386,"Necessary steps will be taken to develop an efficient and dynamic administration by gradually implementing the recommendations of Administrative Reforms Commission and by effecting the necessary restructuring at central, regional and district level administrative organization in order to ma ke the administration more capable and service-oriented.
"
13387,"2. The duties and responsibilities at various levels will be clearly defined and the decision, making process will be streamlined in keeping with HMG's principles of decentralization.
"
13388,"Special emphasis will be laid on the delegation of responsibility and authority from the centre to the level of implementation.
"
13389,"3. Necessary changes will be made in the conditions and requirements for postings, transfers, training and work evaluation, in order to enhance performance and to raise the productivity of employees.
"
13390,"4. The works to be carried out by government agencies in the various sectors will be fixed, and accordingly the organizational structure and employee numbers will be determined.
"
13391,"5. Areas of training in many aspects of public administration to be conducted by various agencies will be specified on the basis of objectives, targets and policies.
"
13392,"The scope of training to be imparted by training institutes also will be defined, and their proto-types will be made from time to time, to avoid duplication and increase the efficiency of training programmes so as to coordinate all training organizations under a single umbrella as far as possible.
"
13393,"As the new management will have to make use of increased scientific technology, the knowledge and skill needed for this will be imparted in the trainings which are to be conducted on a large scale.
"
13394,"6. Undemocratic anomalies in prevailing laws will be corrected and timely reforms introduced to make the civil service democratic and dynamic. The role of the administrative court will be made more effective.
"
13395,"7. The system of classification of services and employees will be reviewed and necessary amendments made.
"
13396,"8. Steps will be taken to make the system of reward and punishment more effective, to relate promotion to performance and ability and to link training to job responsibility and career development.
"
13397,"9. Necessary reforms will be made in the existing financial rules and regulations in order to make efficient use of resources available with development projects.
"
13398,"The system of regular monitoring and evaluating development plans and programmes will be institutionalized.
"
13399,"Emphasis will be given on improvement of the technical management aspect of the project.
"
13400,"In order to make funds readily available at the implementation site, provision will be made to ensure that the authority to spend will automatically be delegated to the concerned office as soon as the budget is passed by parliament.
"
13401,"Steps will be taken to reduce irregularities and to make programme budget more effective.
"
13402,"To increase revenue collection the revenue administration will undergo various reforms and related training programmes will be extended.
"
13403,"In the case of development programmes being affected by the freeze of the released fund at the end of the fiscal year, alternative solution will be explored so that the programme is not affected. 11.
"
13404,"Basic facilities will be provided in order to make the Public Service Commission and the Nepal
"
13405,"Administrative Staff College efficient. A high level manpower coordination committee comprising the representatives of the ministries of General Administration, Education and Culture, the Public Service Commission and universities will be formed and put into action effectively.
"
13406,"12. The management skill will be raised at local level offices.
"
13407,"Special attention will be paid to the quality of services received by the general public. 13.
"
13408,"Special measures will be strictly enforced to control corruption. 14.
"
13409,"With a view to gradually implementing the recommendations made by the high level Administrative Reform Commission and to make improvements in time an arrangement will be made for monitoring, supervision and evaluation through the high level administrative reform monitoring unit. Science and Technology
"
13410,"Science and technology play a very important role in the allround development of the country.
"
13411,"The economic development of the nation depends largely on the state of development of science and technology and their proper use.
"
13412,"Past experience has made it clear that it will be difficult to increase the pace of development and raise the people's standard of living without utilising appropriate technologies.
"
13413,"Efforts seem to have been made in the past to ensure the development of science and technology, but not to the extent warranted by nation. It is only natural that in a predominantly rural nation, the development of the rural sector should play an important role in national development.
"
13414,"The kind of science and technology required for expediting the rural upliftment still remains to be developed.
"
13415,"In fact, it has become necessary to develop science and technology in a manner that facilitates the development of local skills and technology and allows the mobilisation of available natural resources. The National Science and Technology Council was established in 1975 with the aim of conducting various programmes in the field of science and technology in an organised way, linking it with the national development process.
"
13416,"Likewise, the Royal Nepal Academy for Science and Technology was established in 1982 in order to further expedite the development of the science and technology sector.
"
13417,"Government and educational institutions, especially Tribhuvan University, have been involved in the development and expansion of science and technology. Research studies are also being carried out in various government research laboratories mostly in the fields of agriculture, botany, mining, and pharmacy.
"
13418,"The National Agriculture Research Council has been conducting research on various aspects of agriculture. similarly, the National Herbarium and Botanical Laboratory, Forestry Research Centre, the Royal Drugs Laboratories, The Central Food Research Laboratory and others have also been engaged in the research on technology development.
"
13419,"In addition, basic research is also being carried out in the fields of forestry, horticulture, agriculture, engineering and medicine, in the various institutions of Tribhuvan University. The main field of work of the Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology of Tribhuvan University has been the development of science and technology.
"
13420,"The centre has undertaken research mainly on various subjects like solar energy, construction materials and natural products. As scientists and tech nicians play a major role in the development of science and technology, efforts are being made to gradually produce such manpower within the country itself.
"
13421,"High and mid-level scientific and technological education and training programmes are being conducted to produce technical manpower in Tribhuvan University's various educational units such as the Institute of Engineering, Institute of Forestry, Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science, Institute of Medicine and the Institute of Science and Technology .
"
13422,"Low level professional manpower is likewise being produced by His Majesty's Government's vocational schools. But the manpower produced by these institutions are grossly inadequate to meet the country's requirements.
"
13423,"Moreover, this manpower still needs to be qualitatively standardised. An analysis of the achievements made in this field in the past two or three decades will clearly reveal the obstacles faced by science. and technology.
"
13424,"There is an obvious lack of coordination in the activities of the various units that were existing or were created for the development of science and technology. In addition, another major concern has been the inability of scientific and technological development to be geared towards increasing production and productivity.
"
13425,"The necessary contact between the researcher and the user seems to be lacking. Similarly, the results of research have not been able to be brought into practice in a sizeable scale.
"
13426,"There is neither sufficient import of appropriate foreign technology nor is there any attention being paid towards the development of traditional indigenous technologies. Also, the economy has not been able to benefit from the available technology due to the lack of wide dissemination.
"
13427,"Against this background, the Eighth Plan objectives and policies with regard to science and technology sector have been laid down.
"
13428,"Objectives The objectives for the development of science and technology in the Eighth Plan are as follows: (a)
"
13429,"To develop science and technology in a way that they could support the all round development of the nation.
"
13430,"(b) 	To support rural development sectors such as agriculture, cottage and small scale industries by enhancing the scientific and technological capabilities available in the country.
"
13431,"(c) 	To encourage the import of foreign technologies that have a direct bearing on the country's economic development.
"
13432,"The policies that will be adopted to realise the above mentioned objectives are as follows: 1.
"
13433,"To promote the use of appropriate technology for the develo pment of economic sectors such as agriculture, industry, power, transport and communications as well as for the rural development.
"
13434,"2. In the context of research works being carried out in various subjects and areas, priority will be given to research works geared soiving the country's problems.
"
13435,"Greater attention will be given to adaptive research in the development of cereal crops, horticulture, 	livestock as well as rural industries and energy.
"
13436,"3. Emphasis will be laid on scientific research and technological development that assist in the mobilisation of the country's natural resources.
"
13437,"Encouragement will also be given to the augmentation of environment and bio-diversity by conducting special research peculiar to Nepal such as snow-hydrology, drought and cold resistant crops, forest trees, etc. 4. The import of appropriate technologies from various developed and developing countries will be beneficial for the speedy development of the country.
"
13438,"Hence, the transfer of such technologies will be encouraged thro ugh government, non-governmental. and private sectors.
"
13439,"5. Investment from the private sector is a prerequisite for the adoption and transfer of any technology. As the private sector can expedite the process of technology transfer, these activities will be intensified by involving private agencies.
"
13440,"In this context, needed licenses and tariff arrangements will be made to attract foreign investments in viable areas.
"
13441,"6. Appropriate technology development process will be expanded through the promotion of adaptive research with the assistance of the sponsors of technology and capital investors.
"
13442,"Arrangements will be made to institutionalise the system of issuing patents and copyright to encourage the private sector in the development and use of technologies in theNepalecse environment.
"
13443,"7. Necessary coordination will be maintained among various government, non-government and private agencies involved in the enhancement of science and technology.
"
13444,"A government agency will be instituted to consolidate these different units and to coordinate educational and research work on development of science and technology in an effective manner.
"
13445,"8. Qualitative and quantitative improvements will be made in the production of scientific and technological manpower for the all-round national development.
"
13446,"In this context, studies, research and training programmes will be promoted through universities, academies and non-government and private institutions, to develop science and technology in the country.
"
13447,"Concrete steps will be taken to give needed authority to such research institutions.
"
13448,"9. The extent to which the accomplishments made in science and technology are availed to various agencies involved in development works is quite limited.
"
13449,"This will help to make the general public aware of the benefits and uses of science and technology, and thus help increase their usage.
"
13450,"Libraries and information centres will also be mobilised in this task.
"
13451,"10.
"
13452,"Specia l attention will be given to the development of traditional indigenous technology. In this regard, the improvement, development and fine tuning of existing technologies in the rural areas will be encouraged.
"
13453,"Some of these units have not been able to achieve their targets and make desired contribution to the country's development in want of effective leadership and coordination.
"
13454,"The work efficiency of such government and private units will be enhanced and the research programmes will be conducted as per the country's needs.
"
13455,"Necessary arrangements will be made to mobilise internal resources as well as the external assistance from international organisations and institutions in this endeavour. Programmes
"
13456,"In line with the above mentioned objectives and policies, the following programmes will be launched during the Eighth Plan period:
"
13457,"1. 	management and expansion of the infrastructure necessary to enhance the potentials of scientific research and development.
"
13458,"2. 	promotion of the technology transfer and replication.
"
13459,"3. 	production of quality work force.
"
13460,"4. 	publicity and dissemination of technology
"
13461,"1. Management and expansion of the infrastructure necessary to enhance the potentials of scientific research and development.
"
13462,"While Tribhuvan University, HMGN and other non-government agencies are involved in science and technology development, research and development works are carried out by Royal Nepal Academy of Science and Technology, Practical Science and Technology Research Centre, Nepal Agriculture Research Council, Institute of Engineering, Institute of Forestry, etc.
"
13463,"Research and development works are also being carried out to some extent in the private sector. Hence, the programmes which build the capacity of the research and technology development units in the government, non-government and private agencies will be implemented.
"
13464,"Arrangements will be made to create a conducive environment for executing the programmes by these institutions.
"
13465,"Steps will also be taken for providing research equipment, materials and laboratories necessary for these agencies.
"
13466,"The activities that help to increase the capability of the government, non-government and private agencies in developing suitable technology for activities like construction materials production, tunnel construction and other construction works will be carried out.
"
13467,"2. Promotion of Technology Transfer and Replication
"
13468,"Technologies helpful in developing agriculture, industry, transport, communication and construction will be identified, and if necessary, permission will be given to import them.
"
13469,"The concerned government, private and non-government organizations and institutions will be encouraged to undertake this task.
"
13470,"3. Quality Work -force Production
"
13471,"The production of technical manpower required for scientific research and technological development, especially at the high and mid -levels, is insufficient in relation to the demand. To gradually rectify such an imbalance, high and mid-level technical manpower will be produced from the local educational, technical and research institutions.
"
13472,"A review of the structure of the available technical manpower indicates that there are discrepancies in the ratio of high, middle and low level technicians in many areas.
"
13473,"Hence, while formulating programmes, special attention will be given to minimise such discrepancies.
"
13474,"Provision will be made to educate and train the manpower by sending them abroad in subjects which can not be taught locally.
"
13475,"4. Publicity and Dissemination of Science and Technology
"
13476,"Science and technologies that have bearings an the social and economic sectors and that directly or indirectly assist development efforts will be extensively disseminated.
"
13477,"In order to inculcate interest in science and technology from the lowest level of education relevant educational materials will be included with priority in the school curricula.
"
13478,"Public communication media like television, radio, newspapers and the like will also be used to disseminate the effective uses of applied science and technology.
"
13479,"Together with this, public and academic libraries will also be used for this purpose.
"
13480,"Necessary resources for the above mentioned programmes will be arranged while formulating programmes for the related sectors.
"
13481,"Implementation Arrangements
"
13482,"Action will be taken to institute a departmental level unit in the government to implement the mentioned objectives, policies and programmes of the science and technology sector.
"
13483,"Similarly, several local and foreign institutions at the public and private sector involved in scientific and technological research will be extensively mobilised to get concrete contributions from them.
"
13484,"Women in Development
"
13485,"Background
"
13486,"According to the preliminary result of census of 1991, the population of women in the country was about 9,200,000., that is to say, more than fifty percent of the total population.
"
13487,"Nepalese women have been unable to make, the expected contribution in development activities due to illiteracy, poor health, poverty and a traditionally conservative attitude towards them. Financial resources and opportunities like property and income-generating employment are far from the reach of the Nepali womenfolk.
"
13488,"In comparison to men, the average life span of Nepali women is 53 years (for men-56 years) , the maternal mortality rate is 850 per 100,000 and the literacy rate for women is 25 percent (whereas for men- it is 55 percent) .
"
13489,"As long as women, who constitute more than 50 percent of the total population are not fully involved in the upliftment activities of the nation, the economic development of the country will not be possible.
"
13490,"Thus the government is committed to make possible the equal and meaningful participation of women in the development process by improving their economic and social conditions. special provisions have been made in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal - 1991 to make women equal from the legal point of view and to ensure their economic and social development.
"
13491,"A national action plan was prepared for the development of Women in accordance with the declaration of the International Year of the women 1975 A.D. For the development of women, this action' plan has specified the areas of education, health, employment, agriculture, cooperatives and legal matters (where women can participate) and stated the basic objectives and policy measures for the development of women.
"
13492,"Keeping in view the importance of women's participation in national development for the first time in the Sixth Plan, policies to increase the participation of women in national development were laid down.
"
13493,"Similarly, the Seventh Plan also adopted national level policy and working policy for women development to increase their participation by raising their social and economic status.
"
13494,"The programmes which were launched for the development of women in the past have not been able to raise the social and economic levels of women as desired.
"
13495,"In the efforts made for the development of women, certain distinct problems such as the inadequacy of the concerned programme, the lack of institutions for the effective implementation and coordination of areawise policies, and the absence of the analysis of Women's participation in development process have been observed.
"
13496,"To make women participate in the main stream of development, to increase their involvement in every sector of development, to improve their social, economic, academic, political and legal status, to provide productive employment opportunities by increasing their efficiency through appropriate knowledge and skills, to create the appropriate environment and infrastructures so that they are provided with the opportunity to play a decisive role from the local to the national level, the following policies are adopted:
"
13497,"Policies
"
13498,"1. Special programmes will be conducted to increase the involvement of female students in primary, secondary and adult education.
"
13499,"In such programmes, the policy of increasing the admissions of female students; of reducing drop-out before completion; of making it compulsory to appoint a female teacher in a primary school and gradually in the secondary level also in future will be adopted.
"
13500,"In the field of adult and informal education, informal and job-oriented education like the 'chelibeti' programme will be conducted.
"
13501,"General and technical education will be made available to female students who are unable to acquire higher education or devoid of the opportunity to do SO.
"
13502,"A fixed quota will be set aside in order to encourage female students to join higher technical education.
"
13503,"Arrangements will be made to allocate a certain percentage of national and international scholarships for girl students and women.
"
13504,"2. In the context of high maternal and infant mortality rates, programmes targeted for women such as safe motherhood, extension of immunization, and services related to family planning which aim to improve the health standards of women, will be carried out.
"
13505,"These programmes will be extended to the rural sectors through maternal and child workers and female community women health volunteers.
"
13506,"Traditional birth attendants working at the local level will be provided appropriate training and mobilised.
"
13507,"Emphasis will be given to the increased participation of women in the development of high level technical manpower in the health sector.
"
13508,"Keeping in mind the important contributions made by non governmental agencies in providing health services to rural women, various programmes will be conducted through the active participation of organizations under the social Services National Coordination Council and women's associations.
"
13509,"Considering the role of women in controlling population growth, stress will be laid on family planning information, delivery of services and the use of semipermanent devices for birth spacing.
"
13510,"Beds will be increased for maternity service in primary health centres district, zonal and regional hospitals.
"
13511,"3. More women farmers will be encouraged to participate in agriculture development programmes such as trainings on improved fertilizers, seeds, and dissemination trainings.
"
13512,"The supporting services such as credit market and other facilities necessary for agricultural development will be targeted to women farmers, and arrangements will be made to provide them with the necessary training and physical and financial means.
"
13513,"Provision will be made to guarantee trainings and jobs in order to increase mid and high level women agricultural technical work force.
"
13514,"4. Women will also be involved in greater numbers in the field of forest and soil conservation.
"
13515,"Women will be encouraged to actively participate in community afforestation programmes in order to solve environmental problems by protecting and developing forest resources.
"
13516,"Training and dissemination programmes will be conducted to increase awareness among women about the multiple benefits of proper management of forest resources.
"
13517,"Women's participation will also be increased in production and processing of herbs, fodder, etc.
"
13518,"5. As cooperative instit utions can play an important role in the development of rural women, agricultural, cottage and rural industry programmes as well as  cooperative consumer stores and saving programmes will be encouraged through cooperatives.
"
13519,"Women participation will be increased in various cooperative trainings.
"
13520,"6. In order to improve the socio-economic status of women by increasing their participation in the industrial sector, provisions will be made to provide such facilities as skill-oriented trainings, raw materials and industrial management training, and easy and subsidized credit.
"
13521,"Based on market feasibility and utilisation of local skills, arrangements will be made to establish and manage the market of cottage and rural industries. Such industries will be given a position in the industrial estates.
"
13522,"Women's participation will be increased in the implementation and management of industries.
"
13523,"Trainings to enhance leadership, management, entrepreneurship and skill development, that increase women's participation in industry, commerce and tourism sectors, will be provided.
"
13524,"7. Emphasis will be laid on the extension of the programmes such as Production Credit for Rural Women Programme and Small Women Farmers' Development Programmes in order to improve the economic condition of the rural women.
"
13525,"9. Provision will be made to provide institutional support and financial assistance to ensure the management of women and to provide entrepreneurship training and ensure its proper utilization. The welfare of minorities and backward classes will also be considered.
"
13526,"10.
"
13527,"Women development activities which aim to increase awareness, organize public gatherings and mobilise necessary resources for assistance, launched by various women' s organizations and other institutions directly involved in the welfare and protection of women will be made effective.
"
13528,"11.
"
13529,"Necessary measures will be taken to amend laws and acts that hinder women's development.
"
13530,"Legal services and training will be provided to provide legal information to rural women.
"
13531,"12.
"
13532,"Women's participation will be encouraged in the formulation and implementation of rural infrastructure programmes in irrigation, drinking water and road construction.
"
13533,"For this, women's participation will be made compulsory in users' committees.
"
13534,"13.
"
13535,"Technologies that help to save time in the collection of firewood, fodder and water and other domestic activities will be extended to the rural sector.
"
13536,"14.
"
13537,"In order to promote the meaningful participation of women in development programmes, appropriate organizational structure will be established for coordination and monitoring activities.
"
13538,"The Planning Commission will issue guidelines to the ministries for formulating sector-wise programmes for women's development.
"
13539,"Child Development
"
13540,"Children are the future citizens of the nation and it is the responsibility of the government to create an environment that will be conducive in making them active and capable citizens.
"
13541,"According to the population census report of 1981, the population of children under the age of 14 was 6,211,972 whereas the preliminary report of the population census of 1991 indicates that the population of children has reached 7.9 million and constitutes 42.7 percent of the total population.
"
13542,"Nepalese children suffer from malnutrition, disease and illiteracy. 45,000 children still die of gastro-intestinal illnesses every year, 50 percent of the children are suffering from malnutrition and only 27 percent of the children are found to be completing primary education.
"
13543,"Because the majority of the rural population remains poor, children have become a part of the labour force in order to contribute to the family income.
"
13544,"Together with this, the problems pertaining to the disabled, orphaned, addicted and begging children are equally serious.
"
13545,"Though some improvements have been brought about in the fields of child education and health standards by the policy adopted upto the Seventh Plan; the expected results have not been achieved yet.
"
13546,"In conducting programmes related to children, problems arise due to the lack of inter-sectoral coordination, reliable institution reliable statistics.
"
13547,"Since 1990, there has been a general awakening at the international and national -levels for the protection, and development of children.
"
13548,"Nepal is also committed to the resolutions passed by the SAARC Child Conference (1986 A.D.) and the World Child Summit Conference 1990 A.D. for the protection, security and development of children.
"
13549,"As per this commitment, the targets upto 2000 A.D. in the various aspects of child development were decided and the National Child Development Action Plan was formulated.
"
13550,"Together with this, necessary provision has also been made in the constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal (1991) to prevent the exploitation of children and to protect their rights and benefits.
"
13551,"The integrated child act-1991 has also been passed.
"
13552,"The policy adopted in the Eighth Plan for child development is based on the Children and Development Action Plan for the 1990s which was prepared as per the commitment to the World Summit for Children.
"
13553,"With the objectives of making the necessary services and facilities available for the physical and mental development of children from the prenatal and nascent stage to their growing up period; preparing patriotic, disciplined, well-principled and capable citizens; cultivating good habits from the very childhood; protecting the rights and benefits of children and enabling parents to rear children by increasing their income level; the following Children and d evelopment policy has been included in the Eighth Plan: 1
"
13554,"Protected maternity programme for the care of children from the womb onwards will be extended to the village level.
"
13555,"From the time of conception, periodic health check-ups, treatment and protective maternity services will be made available.
"
13556,"2. To reduce the infant and child mortality rate according to the target of the Eighth Plan, extended programmes will be launched to carry out immunisation and to control gastro-enteritis and respiratory diseases.
"
13557,"Together with this, general awareness of child health will be enhanced through the medium of health education.
"
13558,"3. To improve the general and minimum status of nutrition programmes will be implemented maintaining inter-coordination among the food, healthand education sectors.
"
13559,"By creating employment opportunity, the supply of household food will be increased.
"
13560,"6. With the participation of the private sector, non government institutions and local units, child -care centres and pre-primary schools will be established for children in the age group 0-5.
"
13561,"7. Free primary education will be provided to children of primary age.
"
13562,"And, in this context various measures are being taken up to ensure the quantitative and qualitative improvements, such as: increasing the enrolment of girl students, giving education opportunities to those who have been deprived of primary education facilities, to reduce the number of students who quit before the completion of studies and failures in the class.
"
13563,"The child welfare home, orphanage, S.O.S. village etc. and orphan child homes will be developed and expanded. the acts and rules for the labourers will be reformed and arrangeme nts will be made to provide general and vocational education and primary health service facilities in the concerned factories.
"
13564,"For the development of children affected by special circumstances, the government will give encouragement and provide facilities to involve national and international non-governmental organisations and institutions.
"
13565,"Various measures will be adopted to encourage and help the local agencies to fix targets relating to children and development while formulating local level plans, and programmes.
"
13566,"A high level National Cnild Development Council will be established to coordinate and monitor the process of implementing the plans.
"
13567,"The government and nongovernment units involved in the children and development sector will be represented in the council.
"
13568,"The National Planning commission will serve as the secretariat of the council.
"
13569,"Non- Governmental Organization
"
13570,"Introduction
"
13571,"Private and non-governmental organizations play a vital role in national development.
"
13572,"Public welfare activities based on the tradition of gaining religious merit and fame, promoting the welfare of others, and assisting the needy are being carried out privately and institutionally in the private sector'.
"
13573,"As a result, donations from the private sector have contributed considerably to the formation of religious and social trusts.
"
13574,"The nongovernmental organization formally began 66 years ago with the establishment of 'Shree Chandra Kamdhenu Charkha Pracharak Mahaguthi'. The objectives were to participate in the country's development in order to supplement to government efforts, to arouse general awareness and to empower common people.
"
13575,"Subsequently, Paropakar Organisation was established.
"
13576,"After Nepal opened its doors to the outside world following the revolution of 1950, the Red cross, Family Planning Association, Lions and Rotary Clubs were established and run by national social worker's and volunteers with the assistance- of international organizations.
"
13577,"A wide range of non- governmental organizations concerned with child education, and services relating to fatal diseases like leprosy, tuberculosis and cancer were established through the efforts of social workers, With the increase in the number of such organizations, the insufficiency of government acts, rules, policies and plans to integrate and promote such organisations was felt.
"
13578,"The non- governmental organizations also felt the need for a central organisation.
"
13579,"At the government level also an organization was felt necessary to promote social welfare and to involve non-governmental organisations in government efforts.
"
13580,"As a result the Social Services National Coordination Council came into being as the nongovernmental organisation's central agency in 1977.
"
13581,"At present, nongovernmental institutions have been classified on the basis of their functional nature as follows:
"
13582,"These institutions are categorized into national, regional and local levels.
"
13583,"Viewed on the regional basis, about 75 percent of these institutions are in the central region.
"
13584,"Most of these institutions are required to register simultaneously with the district administration office in accordance with the Organisation Registration Act and Social Services National Coordination Council.
"
13585,"Considering the organisations that have only registered with the District Administration Office and are yet to register with the Social Services National Coordination Council, the above mentioned number is very likely to increase.
"
13586,"Currently there are 53 international non-governmental organisations working directly or indirectly in Nepal by signing agreements with the Social Services National Coordination Council. of these 36 are working in the central region.
"
13587,"Although non -governmental organisations have developed and expanded to such an extent and government and non-governmental organizations have been formed at the central level, these nongovernmental organizations have not been able to become self re liant and to burgeon as expected, neither could the resources of the private sector be diverted to the development process as desired.
"
13588,"Some problems have been noticed in this area, they are mainly as follows:
"
13589,"1. There remained a dearth of policies, acts and rules to protect, promote and encourage non-governmental organisations.
"
13590,"2. The Central organisation of the non-governmental organizations and the government mainly exerted greater control and interfered instead of allowing the non-governmental organisation to runindependently.
"
13591,"3. The investment of the private sector could not be attracted towards social and economic development.
"
13592,"4. The administrative procedures were not clear, simple and decentralized.
"
13593,"The organizations lacked coordination.
"
13594,"5. Non-govern mental organisations were concentrated in Kathmandu and were not extended throughout the Kingdom as desired.
"
13595,"A non-governmental organisation is naturally conceived voluntary by nature; not committed to profit making for distributing dividends among its own members; politically neutral; liberal in conducting programmes; oriented towards the upliftment of the poor, needy and helpless; and active in arousing social awareness.
"
13596,"Non-governmental organisations should carry out works, of public importance, involve maximum people's participation and follow democratic practice in selecting the board of directors from among the volunteers. Although they are essentially social organisations, they may conduct other economic programmes that meet public requirements.
"
13597,"Their policies, programmes and budget must be open and transparent.
"
13598,"In view of the limitations of available means and resources, the concrete development of the country is only possible if the vast resources of the private sector are mobilised with effective skills, energy and service, and brought to the mainstream of development to the greatest possible extent through spontaneous mutual organisation of the people. Considering this reality, the Eighth Plan has laid down policies that underline the role and responsibilities of the private and non-governmental organisations.
"
13599,"Policies
"
13600,"1. The participation of private and non-government organisations will be expanded in the field of social and economic development as these organisations are more effective from the points of view cost, flexibility, motivation and dynamism in the implementation of development programmes.
"
13601,"Policies will be adopted to activate the people through the medium of cooperatives, consumer committees, community development and social organisations and institutions.
"
13602,"2. Administrative processes will be simplified in order to prevent the stagnation of the efforts of the community and non-governmental organizations in social and economic development.
"
13603,"Thus, an atmosphere congenial to their self-promotion will be created. For this, provisions will be made for-liberal acts and rules, decentralization of authority, simplification of registration procedures of organisations, and their greater autonomy.
"
13604,"They will also be made more accountable.
"
13605,"3. In keeping with the liberal policy, non-governmental organisations will be given full autonomy to work in the priority sector as specified by the national plan,.
"
13606,"An environment will be created to make the role of non governmental organisations supplementary and complementary in the development efforts of the government and local agencies. They will be encouraged to perform creative and innovative works of public importance.
"
13607,"The non-governmental organisations will be extended to remote and rural areas from privileged areas.
"
13608,"4. In order to increase the efficiency of national and international non-governmental organisations, they will be encouraged by the government to work in certain specific sectors where they can work more effectively, based on their experience, comparative advantages and efficiency.
"
13609,"International non-, governmental organisations will be encouraged to work through Nepalese non-governmental organisations instead of implementing programmes by themselves.
"
13610,"5. As the responsibility of launching most of the social and economic programmes at the local level now fall within the purview of local agencies (district development committees, municipalities and village development committees), the practice of efficiently involving the non-governmental sector will be made to participate actively in social and economic activities with the assistance of, in coordination with and under the guidance of those agencies.
"
13611,"It will be guaranteed that the government will not regain control of or interfere in the programmes conducted by the non governmental organisation.
"
13612,"6. A central unit will operate at the central level to assist non- governmental organisations and to act as a contact point between HMG and international agencies.
"
13613,"International volunteer organisations will be made to register with this central unit while working in Nepal.
"
13614,"A one window system will be adopted and this unit will function as a medium for making available necessary assistance, data and information from the government to the non-governmental organisations.
"
13615,"7. Apart from other development works, social organisations and institutions will be encouraged to focus their activities on empowering the weak and helpless people, classes and communities of the society to lead a life of befitting human standards; on ncreasing the participation of women in development; on developing the appropriate technology, its transfer and use; and on conserving the environment.
"
13616,"8. In areas where the management capacities of nongovernmental organisations located in rural and remote areas are weak, efforts will be made to strengthen the management capacity of such organisations through partnership with international organisations also, along with effective implementation of other social welfare activities.
"
13617,"9. A new system will be set up for effective monitoring and evaluation of the works of the non-governmental organisations. Food and Nutrition
"
13618,"The nutritional status of the majority of Nepalese people is low.
"
13619,"The main reasons for malnutrition and low nutrition are the scarcity of foodgrains, imbalance in distribution, poverty, illiteracy and the lack of health services. various nutrition related surveys indicate that the majority of Nepalese children are afflicted with, protein-energy malnutrition (P.E.M.).
"
13620,"The national nutrition survey of 1975 A.D. estimates that 50 percent of Nepalese children are living under various conditions of malnutrition.
"
13621,"Together with this, micro -nutritive problems like Vitamin-A and iodine deficiencies and the condition of anaemia have also assumed serious dimensions.
"
13622,"As a result, the poor people, females and children are specially suffering from problems like low height and weight, anaemia, blindness, goitre and dumbness.
"
13623,"In accordance with Nepal's commitment to the World Summit for children 1990, a target has been fixed for improving nutritional conditions with regard to children and development by 2000 A.D.
"
13624,"The government is equally determined to bring about improvements in the condition of malnutrition among women and the rural population.
"
13625,"In this context, the following policies concerned with nutrition have been adopted in the Eighth Plan: 1.
"
13626,"As P.E.M. related low nutrition is the major problem in the country, emphasis will be given on food production in the agricultural sector.
"
13627,"Concomitantly, the production of nutritive foods such as fish, meat, milk and vegetables will be increased.
"
13628,"2. A supplementary food supply programme will be launched in order to arrange an effective food supply system in the geographically constrained areas and communities badly affected by the scarcity of food and distressing nutritional status.
"
13629,"Opportunities to enhance the household food supply will be created by generating means for employment and income in order to improve the malnutrition condition among the poor families, women and children.
"
13630,"3. Entrepreneurs will be encouraged to disseminate information about the appropriate baby food prepared at the community and village levels, and also to develop baby food locally.
"
13631,"4. Nutrition education will be included from the primary level education onwards with a view to increase general public awareness with regard to nutritive food, the type of food, the manner in which it is cooked, food storage and changes to be brought about in eating habits.
"
13632,"Nutrition education programmes will be integrated with adult literacy, agriculture, and health target projects and conducted accordingly.
"
13633,"5. A programme will be conducted through the sub-health post in which, the measurement of arm, height and weight of children under three years will be checked.
"
13634,"The nutrition level of children will be improved by encouraging breast-feeding and introducing supplementary food programmes.
"
13635,"A regular weight measurement programme for women, especially pregnant and breast-feeding mothers, will be conducted in order to improve their nutrition level.
"
13636,"On the basis of the weight measurement, programmes related to medication, information about nutritious food and the development of kitchen garden will be conducted for women at low nutrition level.
"
13637,"Collection of statistics on nutrition will be institutionalized for the purpose. 8. The National Nutrition coordination Committee will be strengthened and a food and nutrition surveillance unit will be set up to maintain inter-regional coordination for the effective implementation of programmes.
"
13638,"Further, the nutrition programmes under the agriculture, health, education and local development sector will be made effective.
"
13639,"Though a lot of investment had been made in the development projects in the past, an examination of development activities reveals that if, on the one hand, plans were not implemented according to the fixed schedule, on the other, satisfactory results were not obtained from the projects whose implementation was completed.
"
13640,"In this context, it is essential to give attention to the economized use of means and resources to increase the preparedness and efficiency in implementing the plan and programme.
"
13641,"For this, a mechanism to select the suitable projects, remove obstacles in implementation and complete projects within the stipulated time, is of great importance.
"
13642,"This kind of mechanisms can be developed by strengthening the system of regular monitoring and evaluation of various activities of the projects.
"
13643,"An analysis of the problems of on-going development projects indicates that most of the projects and programmes are unable to attain their targets because the selection process is not fixed and practical; projects are not completed in time; expenses exceed the allotted amount; loans and assistance funds are underutilized; completed projects are in need of proper repair maintenance and are unable to attain permanence.
"
13644,"The institutional arrangement for monitoring and evaluation is very weak.
"
13645,"Under the National Planning commis sion's monitoring procedure, a progress report of the implementation of development projects is submitted every four months and on the basis of this review, implementation is carried out.
"
13646,"4. To update information on the project investments and achievements, and to make such information reliable and easily accessible.
"
13647,"Policies The monitoring and evaluation policies are as follows: 1.
"
13648,"The monitoring and evaluation system will be provided with political commitment from the highest government executive body and it will be considered as the main strategy in effecting reforms in the development administrative machinery.
"
13649,"2. Institutional reform will be made to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation system at the central level.
"
13650,"3. To develop effective monitoring and evaluation network, separate monitoring and evaluation units will be set up in ministries and departments, and these will be strongly linked with the central unit of monitoring and evaluation system.
"
13651,"4. An appropriate work procedure will be formulated to solve the problems faced in the implementation of the projects.
"
13652,"5. Monitoring and evaluation will be used to assess the work-efficiency and career developme nt of the government employees.
"
13653,"6. Separate service cadre will be created for the personnel working in planning, monitoring and evaluation as knowledge of planning, management, implementation, and data collection and analysis is essential for monitoring and evaluation works.
"
13654,"7. In order to make the project implementation more people-oriented and objective-oriented, political institutions and consumer groups will be made to participate in the monitoring and evaluation of projects at various levels.
"
13655,"8. Universities and other academic institutions will also be involved as required in carrying out on-going, midterm and final evaluations of projects and programmes to expedite implementation of the projects, to carry out impartial evaluation of programmes already implemented, to develop the concept for new projects and to draw lessons from the projects under implementation.
"
13656,"Programmes
"
13657,"1. The National Development Action Committee will be formed under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister to coordinate inter-ministerial activities and to solve problems that require high level action.

13659,"The committee will meet regularly once in every four months.
"
13660,"2. The central monitoring and evaluation division of the National Planning Commission will be the central unit for the institutional development and operation of the monitoring and evaluation system.
"
13661,"Appropriate skilled manpower and computer and other facilities will be made available at this division.
"
13662,"3. 	on the basis of work load and number of types of projects, separate monitoring and evaluation division or separate monitoring and evaluation section in the Planning Divisions of the ministry will be formed as required in every ministry.
"
13663,"4. A separate service cadre related to economic planning, monitoring and evaluation will be formed to develop skilled manpower for monitoring and evaluation system.
"
13664,"Under this cadre national and sectoral planning service sub-groups will be created and statistical service sub-group will also be merged with this cadre. Arrangements for professional development (promotion etc.) will be made under this cadre.
"
13665,"5. Suitable training institutions, among those functioning in the country will be strengthened for the provision of efficient training.
"
13666,"6. To provide continuity to the process of monitoring and evaluation and to solve the problems that arise in the process of operation and implementation of the projects, following steps will be taken:
"
13667,"(a) Apart from the previously mentioned National Development Action Committee, a Ministerial Level Development Action Committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of the concerned minister.
